IM-NY-0072,"COVID-19 Summary: This case was initially filed in February 2020 to address the absence of bond hearings for ICE detainees in New York. Then on March 16, 2020, in light of the grave threat posed by congregate detention during the coronavirus pandemic, plaintiffs sought emergency relief: individualized determinations assessing whether detention is necessary in light of flight risk/public safety, and releases where it is not. On March 31, the Court issued an order granting this relief and enjoining the government's ""No-Release Policy."" On December 18, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the preliminary inunction and the case was referred to a Magistrate Judge for settlement proceedings. <hr>

On February 28, 2020, a noncitizen placed in a federal immigration detention facility and denied bond or release while awaiting immigration hearings filed this class-action suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Represented by the New York Civil Liberties Foundation and the Bronx Defenders, the petitioner sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and individual agency officials; he filed a habeas petition to challenge that the absence of an adequate individual custody determination, which led to him being denied bond or release violated his statutory, regulatory, and constitutional rights. He sought declaratory relief that the ICE's practices were unlawful and an injunction ordering the government to conduct adequate individualized custody determinations for members of the proposed classes. 

The policy challenged by the petitioner is referred to in the complaint as the ""No-Release Policy."" It is ICE's alleged policy of denying release and bond to <i>all</i> immigrant detainees arrested in the New York City area. The complaint asserted that the No-Release Policy violated federal law which requires that, within 48 hours of their arrest, many immigrant detainees get an individualized determination of whether they can be released while immigration proceedings go forward. According to data obtained by the petitioner's counsel under the Freedom of Information Act, ""from 2013 to June 2017, approximately 47% of those deemed to be low risk by the government were granted release. From June 2017 to September 2019, that figure plummeted to 3%."" Furthermore, the complaint alleged that in mid-2017, ICE had modified its risk-assessment tool's algorithm to prevent it from recommending that noncitizens be released--the tool was only able to recommend further detention. The petitioner claimed that the No-Release Policy resulted in thousands of detainees being denied individualized custody determinations and remaining in detention facilities ""under harsh conditions of confinement akin to criminal incarceration."" 

The petitioner asserted four causes of action; violations of ""the Immigration and Nationality Act and its implementing regulations, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Rehabilitation Act."" 

The two classes proposed by the petitioner were:
(1) The Petitioner Class: All individuals eligible to be considered for bond or release on recognizance under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(1)-(2) by ICE’s New York Field Office who have been or will be detained without bond; and
(2) the Rehabilitation Act Subclass: All individuals with a disability, as defined by the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations, who are eligible to be considered for bond or release on recognizance under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(1)-(2) by ICE’s New York Field Office and who have been or will be detained without bond.

The case was assigned to Judge Hellerstein. The petitioner's motion for class certification is pending before the district court and the government has yet to file a response to the complaint. 

On March 16, 2020, the petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which argued: <blockquote>This illegal practice of mass detention causes enormous and unnecessary irreparable harm, separating people from their families, jobs, and communities and exposing them to serious health risks without any individualized determination of whether the ongoing denial of liberty is justified. Exacerbating these harms—and increasing the urgency of the petitioners’ request for relief—is the threat posed by COVID-19, the pandemic experts predict will spread to New York City area immigration detention centers in a matter of days, bringing with it the threat of infection, pneumonia, sepsis, or even death.</blockquote> The motion sought prompt provide individualized determinations for class members assessing ""whether detention is necessary based on individualized assessments of the petitioners’ flight risk, danger to the community, and disability and issue class-wide preliminary declaratory relief ordering the same. Pursuant to its habeas jurisdiction, the Court should order release in the event of noncompliance with this procedural remedy."" 

In opposition to the motion for PI, defendants offered ""a single core argument upon which most of its other contentions rely: The No-Release Policy does not exist."" Instead, defendants claim that they are exercising discretion in the making of each individual custody determination. As their secondary argument, defendants asserted that ""review is unavailable under the APA because Plaintiffs have not exhausted administrative remedies and because Plaintiffs do not challenge 'final agency action.'""

Following expedited briefing and a telephonic hearing, on March 31, Judge Hellerstein issued an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction (PI). The order enjoined ICE's New York Field Office Director from following the No-Release Policy and to return to its pre-June 2017 practice of making individualized assessments about whether detention is justified by flight risk or danger. The defendants are required to file a report by April 17, 2020, identifying ""all persons thus arrested by or under the authority of ICE's New York City Field Office and, of such persons, all such persons who have had their bond or recognizance application heard by an immigration judge."" <a href=""https://www.nyclu.org/en/press-releases/nyclu-and-bronx-defenders-statement-preliminary-injunction-no-release-lawsuit"">According to the NYCLU</a>, ""as a result of this ruling, many class members who are in ICE detention must be promptly evaluated for release. This expedited decision provides much-needed relief for people in detention who are exposed to the increasing threat of coronavirus spreading through crowded jails."" In issuing the order, Judge Hellerstein did not provide a statement of its reasoning due to the expedited circumstances; however,  ""the Court, in due course, intends to deliver a more fulsome statement of its reasoning."" 

On April 27, plaintiffs filed a letter addressed to Judge Hellerstein requesting information regarding defendants' compliance with the PI. The defendants responded to the plaintiffs' letter on May 1. The Clearinghouse does not have access to these filings, so the extent to which the defendants have complied with the PI is unclear.

On May 4, Judge Hellerstein issued ""a formal opinion explaining more fully the Court's reasoning for its oral ruling granting Plaintiffs' motion"" for a PI. Judge Hellerstein concluded that ""[p]laintiffs have established a clear and substantial likelihood of being able to demonstrate that the No-Release Policy exists . . . and that none of the procedural hurdles identified by Defendants preclude my awarding injunctive relief in Plaintiffs' favor."" In concluding that the plaintiffs were likely to demonstrate that the No-Release Policy exists, Judge Hellerstein was persuaded by data provided by the plaintiff showing a ""substantial increase in detention rates for final decisions in the New York Field Office beginning in 2017."" Moreover, defendants acknowledged that a No-Release Policy ""is inconsistent with the INA and regulations passed thereunder, at least without notice-and-comment rule making."" Because ""the Court ha[d] already found that Plaintiffs have shown they will suffer irreparable harm without relief and that the equities tilt in Plaintiffs' favor, injunctive relief is called for here."" 2020 WL 2114984. (S.D.N.Y. May 04, 2020). Judge Hellerstein stated at the end of this opinion that the parties had disagreements regarding the implementation of the PI and that these disagreements ""culminated in the government's filing of a motion to clarify and/or amend the injunction"" on May 1. 

After expedited briefing and hearing, Judge Hellerstein issued an order on May 15 denying the defendants' motion to clarify/amend the PI. Judge Hellerstein stated that <blockquote>Defendants were required to: 1. Apply the injunction to all persons who were detained as of April 10, 2020 pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), except those persons already given an individualized custody determination by an immigration judge, and expeditiously determine, or redetermine, their custody status consistent with the injunction; and to 2. Report to the court on May 22, 2020, and weekly thereafter, as to the progress made, which shall be steady and expeditious. All custody determinations and redeterminations must be completed by June 5, 2020. If extensions are required, Defendants may make an application therefore, showing good cause.</blockquote> Judge Hellerstein followed up his May 15 order, giving further explanation of his decision to deny the motion to amend or modify. On July 1, the parties filed a stipulated protective order.

On July 6, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal. The appeal was assigned USCA Case No. 20-2153. The appeal was withdrawn on October 13. 2020 WL 7973940.

On September 21, the district court filed an order directing the parties how to proceed. The court granted the Plaintiffs' request to conduct a deposition pertaining to training received by ICE personnel with respect to the court's earlier injunction. 

On December 18, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the preliminary injunction and the defendants filed their opposition on January 6, 2021, however, the Clearinghouse does not have access to these documents. 

The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Katherine H. Parker for settlement discussions, and the case remains ongoing.","1:20-cv-01803\nCLASS PETITION FOR WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS AND CLASS COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF\n\nINTRODUCTION 1.

An analysis of the government’s own data reveals that, under the policy, virtually all people arrested by immigration authorities in the New York City area are denied bond or release without an individualized determination. See Matter of Adeniji, 22 I. & N. Dec. 1102, 1112-13 (BIA 1999) (construing current\nSection 1226(a)).\n3\n\n\x0cIn 2013, ICE implemented a risk classification assessment tool to assist its officers to make these initial custody determinations. Evaluation of the New York Immigrant Family Unity Project, Vera Institute of Justice, Nov. 2017 (“Vera Evaluation”) (ECF 14-17) at 5, 17 n.34, 20.\nConsequently, anyone who is not released after an ICE arrest remains incarcerated at a minimum until their initial “master calendar hearing” before an Immigration Judge, at which point they may request a custody redetermination from the immigration court. 1:18-CV-10683 (Dec. 5, 2018) (ECF 14-19).\nIn addition, for most people these initial hearings do not offer a meaningful opportunity to apply for bond, especially for those who are not represented by counsel prior to the hearing. Deportation by Default: Mental Disability, Unfair\nHearings, and Indefinite Detention in the US Immigration System, Human Rights Watch & ACLU\n(2010) (ECF 14-16) at 4, 25-31.\nFor individuals whose condition has deteriorated in detention, this risk is even greater.\nIndividuals with visual or auditory disabilities are not provided the aids they need, which can limit\ntheir ability to communicate or prepare documents effectively. Consequently, many people end up losing bond or being deported not because their claims lack merit, but because they have a disability.\nNew York City area detention facilities’ lack of medical and mental health care capacity is particularly dangerous to putative class members in light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. Id. (citing Jean, 472 U.S. at 857).\nHere, because Section 1226(a) provides ICE with the discretion to release people on bond or recognizance, ICE officers cannot adopt a blanket detention policy and must conduct an individualized determination of whether detention is necessary. 14.\nThe No-Release Policy is exactly the type of broad-based, generalized rule incompatib le with individualized determinations.7 Because the policy strips ICE officers of their discretion, requiring them to deny release in virtually every case, it unlawfully nullifies the statute’s and the regulation’s directive that officers “may” release people in ICE custody who do not pose a risk of flight or danger to the community. 2d 398, 403 (S.D.N.Y. 2004) (Hellerstein, J.) (citing Montilla v. INS, 926 F.2d 162 (2d Cir.1991) and Waldron v. INS, 17 F.3d 511 (2d Cir.1993)). This is plainly the case here, as the statute’s implementing regulation safeguards a non-citizen “individua l's constitutionally protected interest in avoiding physical restraint.” 3d at 238 (quoting Zadvydas, 533 U.S. at 690), the Constitution does not.\nB. The No-Release Policy is Arbitrary and Capricious in Violation of the APA As an independent basis for relief, because the government has failed to announce or justify its adoption of the No-Release Policy, it is arbitrary and capricious and must be set aside on that basis alone.

Failures occur at many levels: sometimes internal county jail medical or non-medical personnel caused the delays; other times, ICE is the cause of delays through its failure to make timely determinations of whether to approve medical care.\n32. In recent years, NYLPI has coordinated numerous in-person consultations between volunteer medical providers and people in detention. People often need to be transported to and from facilities to attend court and move between facilities. Increased susceptibility: People incarcerated in jails and prisons are more susceptible to acquiring and experiencing complications from infectious diseases than the population in the community.1 This is because people in jails and prisons are more likely than people in the community to have chronic underlying health conditions, including diabetes, heart disease, chronic lung disease, chronic liver disease, and lower immune systems from HIV.\n14. Failure to keep accurate and sufficient medical records will make it more difficult for the facilities to identify vulnerable individuals in order to both monitor their health and protect them from infection. These harms include serious illness (pneumonia and sepsis) and even death.\n37. JAMA Internal Medicine 2014, 174:721-9.\n12.

Defendants’ Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion As discussed at length infra, Defendants’ opposition papers make a single core argument upon which most of its other contentions rely: The No-Release Policy does not exist. On a warrant issued by the Attorney General, an alien may be arrested and detained pending a decision on whether the alien is to be removed from the United States. The inference is compelling that a change in ICE’s practices, before and after June 2017, explains the dramatic change in statistics of detention.\nIn light of the government’s refusal to explain its change in practice in or about June 2017, there is no better way to define the practice that is enjoined than that stated in the injunction—“using or applying practices or policies relating to the discretion by ICE officers to release to the community on recognizance or pursuant to bond, under … 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), . .",0.5934,0.4961,0.5404,0.1678,0.1403,0.1528,0.1622,0.1356,0.1477
DR-MO-0001,"During 2003, a law professor residing in Illinois developed a mental illness.  Due to this illness, a state court appointed the Office of State Guardian as guardian of his person and, in 2004, of his estate.  He moved to Missouri, where a petition was soon filed to appoint a guardian for him.  The guardianship in Illinois did not affect his eligibility to vote while residing there, but the guardianship adjudication had a different, prohibitive impact on his voting rights in Missouri.  Thus, in October 2004, the former professor, as plaintiff and by the Office of State Guardian, filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, naming as defendants Missouri's governor, attorney general, and several city election officials.  The plaintiff alleged that, previously, he had been adjudged mentally incapacitated and appointed a guardian and, presently, would like to register to vote for, and to vote in, upcoming elections.  Missouri, however, had a constitutional provision and a statute that barred incapacitated persons and those under guardianship from registering to vote and from voting.  Alleging that these state laws denied him his fundamental right to vote and violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses, as well as statutory (and related regulatory) rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C § 12131 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys fees and costs.  Numerous attorneys represented the plaintiff, including those from Illinois' Guardianship and Advocacy Commission, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the ACLU National Voting Rights Project, and the ACLU of Eastern Missouri.

The plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction was denied in an unpublished opinion by District Judge Ortrie Smith on October 26, 2004.  The judge ruled that it would be inappropriate to issue injunctive relief when the plaintiff had other means of protecting his voting rights, such as seeking in state court proceedings that any guardianship order applicable to him be limited in a way that allowed for him to vote.

In December 2004, an amended complaint was filed.  It made essentially the same attacks upon the state's limitations on voting eligibility, but added two additional individual plaintiffs under guardianship orders and one associational plaintiff, the Missouri Protection and Advocacy Services, Inc. (""MOPAS"").  It also added another federal constitutional claim, alleging that the full faith and credit clause was violated by Missouri's law, since deprivation of voting rights occurred in Missouri based upon an Illinois adjudication that did not expressly deprive one of voting rights.

Also in December 2004, the Missouri probate court acted upon the petition for appointment of a guardian for the original plaintiff.  In an unpublished ruling, Circuit Judge Joan Moriarty found that the Illinois guardianship order had no extraterritorial effect and that the Illinois guardian had exceeded its authority in moving the plaintiff to a Missouri psychiatric facility.  The judge directed that the Illinois guardian move the plaintiff to an Illinois facility.  The probate court's ruling, however, was reversed on appeal eight months later.  Appellate Judge Gary M. Gaertner, Sr., writing for a panel of the Missouri Court of Appeals, found that the Illinois guardianship order was entitled to recognition and enforcement under the federal constitution's full faith and credit clause, particularly given Missouri statutes that reflected a willingness to recognize guardianship judgments without regard to the location of the guardian or the ward.  Thus, the Illinois guardian had acted appropriately in moving the plaintiff to Missouri.  That the ward had been moved back to Illinois did not fully moot the case, according to the appellate panel, due to the significance of the lower court's erroneous ruling.  In re Prye, 168 S.W.3d 116 (Mo. App. 2005).

The federal case proceeded, in the meantime, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  These were ruled upon by Judge Smith on July 7, 2006, in an unpublished order.  By this time, two of the individual plaintiffs had been dismissed from the case at their request (including the original plaintiff), leaving MOPAS and a plaintiff under a Missouri guardianship order as the challengers to the Missouri laws.  Judge Smith first decided that the election board's recent issuance of a voter registration card to the individual plaintiff did not moot the case, because the defendants had not met their burden of showing the permanence of their voluntary cessation of the alleged wrongful conduct.  Next, he ruled that the state's use of a guardianship scheme that required individualized determination of a person's abilities and limitations sufficiently allowed for differentiating those who are qualified to vote from those who are not and, so, did not violate the federal constitution or statutes.  Additionally, the opportunity for review and modification of state guardianship orders gave wards recourse to protect their interests in voting.  Accordingly, Judge Smith granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.

Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  On August 23, 2007, that court affirmed the district court, although on somewhat different grounds.  In an opinion by Circuit Judge James B. Loken, the court rejected the state's assertion of the Eleventh Amendment as a bar to suit against the state officials, since the named state defendants had ""some connection"" to enforcement of the allegedly unconstitutional law.  The state's arguments fared better, however, on the merits.  Judge Loken noted that the state guardianship scheme did not categorically disenfranchise persons under full guardianship, since the state's courts retained authority to preserve a ward's right to vote in accordance with the state's statutory mandate to minimize deprivation of a ward's liberty.  Thus, the state law did not deny equal protection or federal statutory rights, given the law's lack of a categorical bar to voting.  Further, the court ruled that the advocacy group plaintiff (MOPAS) lacked standing to bring suit on behalf of mere constituents, who lacked the active relationship to the organization that exists when membership exists.  Without participation by a ward who had been denied the right to vote because a guardian was appointed for reasons other than mental incapacity, MOPAS' assertion of the rights of such a hypothetical plaintiff was ""too abstract,"" according to Judge Loken, who saw MOPAS as asking for an impermissible advisory opinion.  Missouri Protection and Advocacy Services, Inc., v. Carnahan, 499 F.3d 803 (8th Cir. 2007).

Likewise, the remaining individual plaintiff could not prevail, since his local election board had denied him the right to vote in error, not noting that his guardianship order expressly allowed him to retain that right.  The board, noting the error after he had been added to the case as a plaintiff, issued him a voter registration card.  This made his pending claim for injunctive relief moot, as there was no reasonable expectation that the earlier error would be repeated.  Further, he had no standing to assert the rights of others and had not been injured by the alleged flaws in the Missouri voting laws, since his voting rights had been preserved in the guardianship order.  Id.

Efforts to seek rehearing and rehearing en banc were denied on October 18, 2007.  After the appellate ruling in favor of the defendants became final, no further material activity occurred in this case.

Further, the general authority of Missouri’s Attorney General to appear and be heard in cases in which the state’s interests are involved, § 27.060, RSMo, including appearances to defend the constitutionality of state statutes, does not constitute enforcement of any statute in question. See City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 103 S. Ct. Id. Plaintiffs do not meet at least the first of these criteria.\nThe term “qualified individual with a disability” is defined by 42 U.S.C. § 12131(2) as “an individual with a disability who, with or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, or practices, the removal of architectural, communication, or transportation barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and services, meets the essential eligibility requirements for the receipt of services or the participation in programs or activities provided by a public entity.” ( But Dr. Appelbaum’ testimony is not reliable under a Daubert analysis. Thus, while no Missouri appellate court has addressed the question, we are confident that the Supreme Court of Missouri would construe the term ""adjudged incapacitated"" in § 115.133.2 as having the same meaning as the term ""has a guardian [appointed] by reason of mental incapacity"" in Article VIII, § 2.\nThe Missouri Probate Code authorizes the appropriate probate court[3] to appoint a qualified guardian for an adult if a hearing has established ""by clear and convincing evidence that the person for whom a guardian is sought is incapacitated as defined in this law."" Rather, MOPAS asserts only associational claims on behalf of developmentally disabled persons it is authorized by Missouri and federal law to represent.[6] Defendants argue that MOPAS lacks associational standing to assert this claim. The finding necessary to appoint a guardian 0907 that a person is unable to receive and evaluate information or communicate decisions 0907 is indicative of a ""mental incapacity"" to vote within the meaning of Article VIII, § 2. 2174, 135 L.Ed.2d 606 (1996); Steger v. Franco, Inc., 228 F.3d 889, 893 (8th Cir.2000). Judicial support for this construction of the statutes is found in Estate of Werner, 133 S.W.3d 108, 109 (Mo.App.2004), where the Court of Appeals affirmed a guardianship order reinstating the ward\'s voting rights, although that portion of the order was not at issue on appeal.

IM-CA-0108,"Two refugees whose families fled Cambodia in the 1970s filed this class action lawsuit, challenging U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for arbitrarily and unlawfully detaining them. The plaintiffs represented other Cambodian refugees living in the U.S. since escaping the violence of the Khmer Rouge regime. The plaintiffs argued that ICE violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by unlawfully revoking their release from its custody and detaining them when removal was not reasonably foreseeable and without individualized determinations of danger and flight risk. The plaintiffs sought habeas, declaratory, and injunctive relief. Represented by Asian Americans Advancing Justice and a private law firm, the plaintiffs filed this case on October 27, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

The complaint sought to declare a class of approximately 1,900 individuals. The plaintiffs stated that all class members escaped the Khmer Rouge regime and its ""campaign of mass murder and torture"" in Cambodia in the 1970s when they were young children. They had lived in the United States ever since, growing up ""in communities in crisis...struggl[ing] with unaddressed trauma, poverty, and violence-ridden neighborhoods, with almost no culturally competent resources to address their needs."" Class members ""made mistakes in their youth,"" which led to involvement in the criminal justice system, loss of their Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status, and removal proceedings. However, ICE subsequently released the class members after Cambodia disallowed repatriation. ICE allowed the class members to return to their communities but required them to regularly report back to demonstrate they were complying with the conditions of their release. Many of these class members established families in the U.S.

The complaint stated that, as of October 2016, Cambodia suspended a 2002 repatriation agreement with the U.S. A year later, following a U.S. government freeze on further tourist visas to Cambodians until Cambodia agreed to aid the U.S. in removing Cambodian refugees, ICE began raiding Cambodian refugee homes and workplaces. The plaintiffs asserted that ICE conducted these raids ""without cause and without providing procedural protections required by law . . . [and] without any evidence that Cambodia would now accept their repatriation."" Further, the plaintiffs argued that they ""received no adequate explanation of the reasons for detention, no opportunity to be heard regarding any purported reasons for detention, and no individualized consideration before a neutral decisionmaker regarding whether they pose a danger or flight risk that could warrant detention.""

On October 30, the case was assigned to Judge Cormac J. Carney.

On December 12, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. They also filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO) as to the removal of plaintiffs scheduled to begin on December 18, arguing that because they only had learned that removal proceedings were to commence on December 7, they needed the TRO so that they could have an opportunity to reopen and challenge their orders of removal. These documents are not publicly available.

Judge Carney granted the TRO on December 14. While the amended complaint is not publicly available, it appears that the complaint sought to define a class ""on behalf of approximately 1,900 individuals who received orders of removal to Cambodia but were subsequently released from custody and have since been living in the United States."" 

Judge Carney granted a preliminary injunction on January 25, 2018. 306 F. Supp. 3d 1147 (C.D. Cal. 2018). He enjoined the government from executing final removal orders as to the plaintiffs and a subclass of 92 putative class members who received or were being considered for travel papers. The injunction prevented final removal orders until February 5, 2018. Judge Carney held that denying an injunction ""amounts to a denial of due process"" because while removal orders for many of the plaintiffs have been dormant for over a decade, ""[c]ircumstances have changed in the interim that may allow Petitioners to raise serious questions regarding the validity of their underlying convictions and removal orders."" 

On February 8, the government moved to dismiss the case; the plaintiffs responded on March 2, and the government replied on March 12. 

On February 23, the plaintiffs moved to relate this case to <i><a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16464"">Trinh v. Homan</a></i>, a case challenging ICE's detention of Vietnamese refugees stripped of their LPR status due to criminal convictions. On March 14, Judge Carney granted plaintiffs' motion to relate the cases.

On March 19, the plaintiffs moved for another preliminary injunction and class certification. Meanwhile, the defendants appealed Judge Carney's January 25 preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit, which opened a new docket (No. 18-55389).

After a March 26 hearing, Judge Carney denied the government's motion to dismiss, and granted the plaintiffs' habeas claim. 2018 WL 1941756 (C.D. Cal.). First, Judge Carney held that the Court had jurisdiction over the habeas petition and due process claim, because plaintiffs challenged not the removal order itself but the legality of the detention. Judge Carney then ordered plaintiff released from ICE custody, finding his arrest, detention, and threatened deportation unlawful. 

Judge Carney wrote:
<blockquote>Chhoeun poses no danger to the community. Prior to ICE’s wrongful re-detention of him, he was living peaceably in the community for the past fourteen years. He was gainfully employed. He had built strong ties to his family and his community. The Government simply had no justification to take away, without due process, Chhoeun’s liberty to carry out his life. . . . The Government’s argument [that an person subject to an order of removal lacks due process rights] trivializes, indeed ignores, fundamental principles of liberty and due process embedded in our Constitution. . . . And due process demands that the Government consider the totality of an individual’s circumstances before taking away his or her liberty. <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16434"">Ragbir v. Sessions</a>. . . . The Government’s position, which would do away with any individualized consideration before taking away someone’s liberty, is repugnant to due process.</blockquote>
On April 12, Judge Carney rejected the proposed class definition because a class consisting of 13 members was not numerous enough. 

On May 11, 2018, certain defendants moved for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. On June 4, 2018, Judge Carney denied the motion without prejudice. On May 24, 2018, the government appealed the March 26 order denying their motion to dismiss.

On July 2, 2018, the plaintiffs again moved to certify the class, which the district court approved on August 14, 2018. Judge Carney certified the following class: ""All Cambodian nationals in the United States who received final orders of deportation or removal, and were subsequently released from ICE custody, and have not subsequently violated any criminal laws or conditions of their release, and have been or may be re-detained for removal by ICE.""

Back at the Ninth Circuit, on December 7, 2018, the government moved to voluntarily dismiss their March 23 appeal of Judge Carney’s preliminary injunction. Voluntary dismissal of this appeal was granted on December 11, 2018. 2018 Us App Lexis 34850 (9th Cir. Dec. 11, 2018). 

On December 31, 2018, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the government from re-detaining any class member without notice. The plaintiffs alleged that the government had conducted two raids since the raid involving the plaintiffs, detaining many class members in the process. They had received credible information suggesting that another raid was forthcoming and had requested the government to provide class members with notice, which it refused to do without a court order. Judge Carney granted the TRO on January 3, 2019, requiring the government to give at least fourteen days’ notice before re-detaining any class member. Judge Carney also ordered the government to show cause as to why a preliminary injunction should not issue in light of the TRO.

The government then successfully requested an extended period of time to file its opening brief in its second appeal, that of Judge Carney’s March 26 denial of the government’s motion to dismiss. However, shortly thereafter, the government similarly moved to voluntarily dismiss this appeal. The Ninth Circuit granted that dismissal. 2019 Us App Lexis 9447 (9th Cir. Mar. 29, 2019). 

Back in the district court, on April 10, 2019, Judge Carney vacated the order to show cause in light of the parties’ stipulation. He ordered the parties to make a good faith effort to settle the case before proceeding with their respective motions for summary judgment, but set a briefing schedule in the event that they do not. Deadlines for briefing were set for September through November of 2019. To effectuate a settlement, the court assigned a mediator on October 15, 2019.

However, the parties did not reach a settlement and proceeded to summary judgment. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on October 23, 2019. The defendants likewise filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on January 9, 2020. On March 4, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment. 442 F. Supp. 3d 1233. The court reasoned that the plaintiffs held a compelling liberty interest in remaining in the United States where they had lives and families; that there would be a high risk of erroneous deprivation of that liberty interest and thus a high value in giving notice to the potential detainee; and that there were few burdens or interests that supported not giving notice before re-detaining the plaintiffs. Thus, the court concluded that notice was fundamental to protecting the plaintiffs' due process rights. 

The court on March 20, 2020, ordered the parties to file a joint permanent injunction proposal. On April 27, 2020, the court entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and further ordered a permanent injunction that enjoined ICE from re-detaining any member of the class without first giving two weeks' written notice. 

The defendants appealed the district court's ruling on summary judgment and its order for a permanent injunction to the Ninth Circuit, docket number 20-55665, on June 25, 2020. As of April 16, 2021, the parties have engaged in mediation within the Ninth Circuit.","esa) (Entered: 10/30/2017)\n12 60 DAY Summons issued re Complaint 1 as to defendant Elaine C. Duke.

Leiva-Perez v. Holder, 640 F.3d 962, 966 (9th Cir. who is arriving in the United States . . . The court went on to reason that ""accounting for the rule against surplusage, application of the Dictionary Act readily leads to the conclusion that Section 1158(a)(1)\'s use of the present tense of `arrives\' plainly covers an alien who may not yet be in the United States, but who is in the process of arriving in the United States through a POE."" In support of its interpretation of ""arrives in,"" the government relies principally on the presumption against extraterritoriality as reason to disregard the rule against surplusage, the Dictionary Act, section 1225\'s ""arriving in"" language, and the legislative history, which collectively led the district court to the opposite conclusion. Nor does the Rule apply to asylum seekers who are ""victim[s] of a severe form of trafficking"" or if ""[t]he only countries through which the alien transited en route to the United States were, at the time of transit, not parties to"" certain international agreements. See, e.g., id. at 790-807; FTC v. Qualcomm Inc., 935 F.3d 752, 755-57 (9th Cir. 1006 n.6, is deeply troubling.\nThe majority and district court also justify the injunction under the All Writs Act, 28 U.S.C. § 1651, on the theory that the Third Country Transit Rule ""would effectively moot Plaintiffs\' request for relief in the underlying action by extinguishing 1025*1025 their asylum claims."" The government\'s official metering guidance thus prohibited the provision of any ""tickets or appointments"" or other means of scheduling persons for entry.\nThe difficulty the government would face in creating records of persons approaching the border during periods of metering was also exacerbated by evidence in the record of large groups of immigrants approaching U.S. ports of entry. Ms. Leutert also relies upon a news article reporting that when an individual in Tijuana misses his number being called, the individual may be reassigned a new number at the end of the line. at 1015 (quoting Al Otro Lado, 2019 WL 6134601, at *19). We entertain the stay motion here even though the district court has not yet ruled on it, because the delay in the district court was sufficiently long to fall under Rule 8(a)(2)(A)(ii).\n\n\x0c[6] The Dissent questions the district court\'s authority to grant the injunction in this case because the Rule is not challenged in Al Otro Lado\'s operative complaint. But the class members were not required to do so when they approached the POE to apply for asylum, and some class members face Mexico\'s time bar because they relied on the government\'s representations that they could apply for asylum in the United States if they waited in line.\n\n\x0c[1] The district court and plaintiffs refer to the Rule as the ""Asylum Ban.""

CJ-WA-0001,"On February 2, 1996, a group of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Native-Americans having felony convictions filed a pro se action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, claiming that the state of Washington's felon disenfranchisement scheme violated the Voting Rights Act (""VRA""), 42 U.S.C. § 1971 et seq., and the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  The state constitution made persons convicted of an ""infamous crime"" (generally, a felony) ineligible to vote.  Because, according to the plaintiffs' allegations, minorities were disproportionately prosecuted and sentenced, they were disproportionately represented among the persons disenfranchised under the Washington constitution.  The plaintiffs alleged that the resultant race-based vote denial and vote dilution violated the VRA and the federal constitution.

District Judge Robert H. Whaley granted the plaintiffs' motion for appointment of counsel, resulting in the plaintiffs being represented by private attorneys and counsel from University Legal Assistance.  Subsequently, counsel amended the complaint, adding a plaintiff, retaining the VRA violation claim, and modifying the list of federal constitutional amendments allegedly violated to include the First, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments.  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss.  Judge Whaley denied the motion in part, saying that the VRA could be proven to be violated by a vote disenfranchisement scheme that results in vote denial based upon race, as the plaintiffs had alleged.  The claims of vote dilution in violation of the VRA and of constitutional violations were too conclusory or unsupported, in the judge's view, leading him to dismiss those components of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  Farrakhan v. Locke, 987 F. Supp. 1304 (E.D. Wash. 1997).

On October 26, 1999, plaintiffs filed another amended complaint, making the same claims of racial discrimination against their voting rights but adding causes of action based upon alleged denial of the right to vote due to nonpayment of legal financial obligations, which the plaintiffs said constituted a denial due to a previous condition of servitude, and upon a claimed denial of due process stemming from the allegedly vague and unduly burdensome statutory process in Washington for an offender to gain restoration of voting rights.  The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys' fees and costs.

Judge Whaley granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in an unpublished order on December 1, 2000.  Although the judge found that the disenfranchisement provision had a clear disproportionate impact on racial minorities, he said the plaintiffs could not show a causal relationship between the disenfranchisement and the result prohibited by the VRA.  Neither was there any evidence that the disenfranchisement provision was motivated by racial animus or that its operation, by itself, had a discriminatory effect.  In the judge's view, discrimination in the criminal justice system may show a flaw in that system, but that is different than proving a flaw with the disenfranchisement system.  The totality of the circumstances failed to establish a causal link between Washington's felon disenfranchisement provision and reduced minority access to the state's political process.  The court also rejected the challenge to the state's restoration of civil rights process, saying that the plaintiffs allegations failed to establish their standing to make such claims (i.e., they did not show that they were eligible to or had sought restoration) and, even had they shown standing, they had produced no evidence that something in the restoration process made restoration difficult or impossible because of race.

The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  (Amicus curiae briefs supporting the plaintiffs were filed by attorneys with the ACLU of Washington, the Brennan Center for Justice, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.)  A panel of the that court agreed with Judge Whaley that a claim of vote denial due to felon disenfranchisement is cognizable under Section 2 of the VRA, that the state disenfranchisement law did not violate the VRA, and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the state's restoration of rights process; however, the appellate court reversed the district judge on his analysis of whether the totality of the circumstances established unlawful racial discrimination and denial of minority voting rights as the effect of the disenfranchisement provision.  Specifically, Circuit Judge Richard A. Paez wrote, the district court should not have excluded from its' analysis evidence of racial bias in the criminal justice system, because precedent requires examination of how a challenged voting system interacts with external factors such as social and historical conditions to result (or not) in the denial of the right to vote on account of race or color.  The court remanded the case for the district court to make factual findings assessing the totality of the circumstances, including plaintiffs' evidence of racial bias in the state's criminal justice system.  Farrakhan v. Washington, 338 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir. 2003).  Before the remand, however, the appellate court considered whether to hear the matter en banc.  A majority of the active judges did not vote for en banc review, so none occurred, but judges favoring rehearing filed a lengthy dissent calling the panel opinion a questionable interpretation of the VRA, potentially destructive of the VRA, and wrongly based upon plaintiffs' evidence of statistical disparities in the criminal process when studies based on such disparities are ""notoriously unreliable.""  Farrakhan v. Washington, 339 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir. 2004) (Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc).  The state failed in its' effort to have the U.S. Supreme Court grant a writ of certiorari to review the case.  Locke v. Farrakhan, 543 U.S. 984 (2004).

When the case finally returned to the district court, the parties filed a joint status report advising that several months of discovery proceeding were anticipated, that a fifth amended complaint was contemplated, as was a motion for class certification, and that cross-motions for summary judgment would be forthcoming.  Accordingly, the parties asked that the trial setting be for no earlier than March 2006.

Cross-motions for summary judgment were eventually filed and, in an unpublished order on July 7, 2006, Judge Whaley granted the state's while denying the plaintiffs'.  While he continued to find plaintiffs' statistical evidence of racial bias in Washington's criminal justice system ""compelling"" and a factor which interacts with the state's disenfranchisement law in a meaningful way, the judge concluded that the multiple other factors relevant to analysis under a totality of the circumstances test counterbalanced the discriminatory effects resulting from the functioning of the state's criminal justice system.

The plaintiffs appealed for the second time to the Ninth Circuit in December 2006.  After oral argument, Washington law was changed to provide that the voting rights of felons will be ""provisionally restored,"" at such time as those convicted under Washington state law are no longer under the authority of the Washington Department of Corrections, and, as to those convicted under federal law or in any other state, they are not in custody. See Wash. Laws of 2009, ch. 325, HB 1517.  The Circuit Court determined the new law had no effect on the case but to moot the claims of one plaintiff who was no longer in custody.  The Court reversed the lower court decision, holding that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the discriminatory impact of Washington's felon disenfranchisement is attributable to racial discrimination in Washington's criminal justice system and remanded with instructions to grant summary judgment to plaintiffs. 

On October 7, 2010, the en banc Ninth Circuit overturned the panel decision, holding that a state can prohibit felons from voting even if the ban disproportionately harms minorities.  The court found that plaintiffs had not shown ""that their convictions and resulting disenfranchisement resulted from intentional racial discrimination in the operation of the state's criminal justice system.

As of March 24, 2012 there has been no additional action in this case.

If convicted felons (of any racial background) do not participate in the process in the first place it is difficult to demonstrate a disparate impact upon the racial group.\n\nThe court should also note that although 35 years have passed since enactment of the Voting Rights Act, felon disenfranchisement has not been perceived as a violation of the Act, the issue having been raised only recently. A challenge to the process for restoring civil rights is not the same as establishing a right to a certificate of discharge in ~d of itself.\nPlaintiffs\' comparison of legal fmancial obligations to a poll tax also sheds no light on their claim to have standing to challenge the restoration process. They offer no argument, however, as to how compliance with a term of duly imposed court order could be construed as a poll tax, suggesting no basis for relief.

WALLACE TASHIMA, and M. MARGARET McKEOWN, Circuit Judges.\nTASHIMA, Circuit Judge:\nPlaintiffs, minority citizens of Washington state who have lost their right to vote pursuant to the state's felon disenfranchisement provision, filed this action in 1996 challenging that provision on the ground that, due to racial discrimination in the state's criminal justice system, the automatic disenfranchisement of felons results in the denial of the right to vote on account of race, in violation of § 2 of the Voting Rights Act (“VRA”), 42 U.S.C. § 1973. Section 2(b) further explains that\n\n\x0cA violation of subsection (a) ... is established if, based on the totality of the circumstances, it is shown that the political processes leading to nomination or election in the State or political subdivision are not equally open to participation by members of a class or citizens protected by subsection (a) ... in that its members have less opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process and to elect representatives of their choice.\n42 U.S.C. § 1973(b). Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 250, 106 S.Ct. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970) (internal citation, quotation marks, and brackets omitted). See Thornburg, 478 U.S. at 48 & n. 15, 106 S.Ct. Thus, to the extent that minorities are disadvantaged in pre‐trial release, this has real potential for contributing to disparities in felony conviction rates.\n*17 Likewise, Dr. Beckett reported that the disparity between whites and minorities (specifically, blacks and Latinos) in drug possession and delivery arrests is largely the result of three organizational practices‐ the police's focus on crack cocaine, on outdoor drug venues, and on the downtown area‐that are not “explicable in race‐neutral terms.” FN29\n*19 Plaintiffs here have introduced evidence demonstrating what the Salt River plaintiffs could not. See Johnson v. Governor of Fla., 405 F.3d 1214, 1234 (11th Cir. Summary judgment for Washington is therefore the only possible outcome.\nThe Sixth Circuit rejected a section 2 challenge of Tennessee\'s felon disenfranchisement law that was based primarily on statistical differences between minority and white convictions. Nonetheless, the fact that ""there was no evidence of historical voting-related discrimination ... no evidence of discrimination in the candidate slating process that denied minority candidates equal access to the political process.... [and no] evidence that minorities experience difficulty in electing representatives of their choice,"" id., led the court to conclude that section 2 had not been violated, id. at 313. The panel misunderstands its task at this stage. 42 U.S.C. § 1973gg-6(g)(3).\nCongress drafted federal prosecutors to help states disenfranchise felons even as it enacted the NVRA to extirpate certain registration practices that dampen minority participation in the political process. Instead, focusing on the disenfranchisement scheme itself, the court concluded that there was no evidence that the enactment of Washington\'s disenfranchisement provision ""was motivated by racial animus, or that its operation by itself has a discriminatory effect,"" and therefore determined that Plaintiffs had failed to establish a Section 2 violation.\nWe disagree with the district court\'s analysis, because it conflicts with our well-established understanding of Section 2.",0.6076,0.4363,0.5079,0.2146,0.1541,0.1793,0.1914,0.1375,0.16
FH-DC-0011,"On March 15, 2011, a group of Hispanic farmers and ranchers brought suit against the United States and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, were potential claimants in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12757"">the proposed settlement agreement in <i>Garcia v. Vilsack</i></a>, an earlier case in which a group of Hispanic farmers and ranchers filed suit against the USDA, claiming that the USDA had systematically denied Hispanics farmers and ranchers loans and loan servicing in the 1990s.  In this case, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had violated their Fifth Amendment equal protection and due process rights by offering a settlement agreement unequal to the settlement agreement offered to <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12515"">African American</a>, <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12657"">Native American</a>, and women farmers and ranchers who had previously sued the USDA over similar discrimination. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the proposed settlement agreement was unequal in comparison to the other discrimination settlements because it did not provide judicial supervision (leading to deficient notice and defective claims processes); did not provide assistance of class counsel; provided disproportionate monetary relief (only $1.33 billion, compared to the $2.23 billion in the African American discrimination case, despite Hispanic farmers outnumbering African American farmers 12 to 1); required additional proof elements in the claims process; and did not propose compensation for non-credit farm benefits. The plaintiff filed under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. They sought a declaration that this settlement proposal violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights and a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from engaging in racially discriminatory treatment of Hispanic farmers by treating them differently in comparison to African American, Native American, and women farmers with similar complaints.

On March 25, 2011, the plaintiffs filed papers for a putative class of plaintiffs in the <i>Garcia</i> case, who allegedly ""were subjected to, and continue to be subject to, USDA discrimination in its farm benefit programs"" and who ""are potential claimants"" under the defendants' administrative claim process for Hispanic farmers.

On May 11, 2011, the US moved to dismiss the case, denying any unlawful conduct and stating that the plaintiffs lacked standing, were attempting improper claim splitting, and were time barred. The plaintiffs moved to certify the class on June 11, 2011, and the defendant moved on June 14 to stay the certification motion pending adjudication of the motion to dismiss.  On November 11, 2011, Judge Reggie B. Walton entered an order asking parties to clarify whether the plaintiffs' claims were ripe, given that the settlement agreement in <i>Garcia</i> had not been formally proposed.  On December 21, 2011, Judge Walton entered an order denying all extant motions without prejudice, and holding the case in abeyance pending an announcement of the final version of Defendants' ADR program, because this suit would be unripe until the settlement agreement was formally proposed.

On January 20, 2012, the defendants in the <i>Garcia</i> case submitted the proposed framework for the settlement agreement. Based on the proposal, the plaintiffs in this case submitted a first amended complaint on April 13, 2012, and Judge Walton lifted the stay on the case on August 24, 2012. The defendant then moved to dismiss the amended complaint on September 24, 2012. On December 11, 2012, Judge Walton granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, ruling that there was no injury because participation in the administrative claims process was optional, and that the suit lacked redressability because the court had no way of compelling the government to propose a specific settlement agreement. 908 F. Supp. 2d 146.

On February 15, 2013, the plaintiffs entered a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (docket no. 13-05044). The Circuit court heard oral arguments from the parties more than a year later on May 7, 2014. In its opinion, the appellate court agreed that the plaintiffs' prayer for relief overreached because the court could not coerce a party, especially an Executive Branch agency, to settle in a case. Therefore, the district court correctly held that it lacked authority to enjoin the government to offer class settlement such as in previous cases. However, the appeals court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded the case on May 27, 2014 because the district court could have granted relief in the form of an injunction ordering the government not to act on unlawful racial grounds toward Hispanic and female farmers. 

While the parties litigated the case in district court on remand, the defendant filed a new motion on November 25, 2014 to dismiss on the grounds that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the complaint failed to state a valid claim. In response to the defendant's motion, the district court officially reopened the case on May 14, 2015.

On October 26, 2015, the defendant filed a status report regarding the voluntary alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program established for farmers alleging discrimination against Hispanic and female individuals in making or servicing farm loans. The Claims Adjudicator approved a total of 3,210 claims in the ADR program. On October 23, 2015, USDA reported as a total of 2,847 of the approved claims had been paid by the Judgment Fund, and another 126 claims were in process.

Months later, Judge Walton granted the defendant's renewed motion to dismiss the case. When the defendant moved to dismiss in November 2014, Judge Walton found that in light of the appeals court's agreement that a court cannot order a party to settle, only the plaintiffs' equal protection claim remained. Judge Walton reasoned that the plaintiffs' other claims related to specific terms of the ADR and therefore the court did not have the authority to adjudicate those issues.

In relation to plaintiffs' equal protection claim, the defendant contended that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim because the complaint did not allege facts showing that the defendant had a discriminatory purpose in settling claims brought by hispanic or female farmers. Judge Walton agreed with the defendant and dismissed the case in March 2016, closing the case.","and the Administrative Procedure Act (""APA""), 5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq., As this case is brought under the Fifth Amendment of the United States\nConstitution,jurisdiction is founded upon 28 U.S.C. § 1331,28 U.S.C. § 1343,28 U.S.C. § 2201, and 28 U.S.C. § 2202.\nIII.

Glickman, No. Defendant Tom Vilsack is the USDA Secretary. Appeals are too often delayed and for too long. The Pigford plaintiffs alleged that in some cases, USDA simply threw discrimination complaints in the trash without ever responding to or investigating them. On October 13,2000, Hispanic farmers filed a third virtually identical class action suit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, styled Garcia v. Gliclanan, alleging that the USDA, just as it did with African-American and Native American farmers, discriminated against Hispanic farmers by also denying them access to USDA\'s farm credit and non-credit farm benefit programs in violation ofthe ECOA and the APA, and that USDA refused, and still refuses, to investigate their complaints of discrimination in those programs. Unlike the two judges in the AfricanAmerican and Native American farmers\' cases, the judge in the Hispanic farmers\' case, who also presided over the female farmers\' case, refused to certify the case as a class action on the basis of USDA\'s well-documented and admitted refusal to investigate complaints of discrimination filed with it by Hispanic farmers.\n57. THE FOOD, CONSERVATION, AND ENERGY ACT OF 2008 62. Although the USDA discriminated against Hispanic farmers in administering its farm loan and non-credit benefit programs, all class members here have suffered identical discrimination by reason of the government\'s refusal, solely because these plaintiffs are Hispanic and not African-American or Native American, to provide them the same settlement terms, of offer to them comparable compensation for their injuries, as the government has provided to similarly situated African-American farmers and similarly situated Native American farmers.\n93. Plaintiffs\' counsel are experienced class action lawyers who will adequately represent the class. The foregoing allegations are re-alleged and incorporated herein by reference. There is no legitimate justification for treating similarly situated members of different racial groups differently. Due process also demands a meaningful post-deprivation remedy for damages sustained. The disparity in treatment cannot reasonably be explained without reference to racial status. Far from a meaningful post-deprivation remedy, for many there is a real prospect under the government\'s announced ""program that, while regarded by the USDA as a successful claimant, the deck has been stacked so that they in fact end up with nothing in cash and still be in debt to USDA.\n45\n\n\x0cCase 1:11-cv-00541-RBW Document 1 Filed 03/15/11 Page 46 of 47\n113. ,\n\n)\n\n)\n\nPlaintiffs,\n\n)\n\n)\n\nv.\n\n)\n\nCivil Action No. Refusing to involve the courts in ongoing\n2 In addition to the filings already identified, the Court considered the following submissions in rendering its decision: (1) the Memorandum in Support of Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss (“Defs.’ Inc. v.

PB-DC-0010,"This case is one of several federal cases challenging the Trump Administration’s ongoing attempts to reduce Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).    The case arose from federal and state efforts to limit the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Medicaid, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, requires states to cover all individuals of a mandatory covered population group and prohibits states from imposing additional eligibility requirements. However, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act allows DHHS to waive certain federal Medicaid requirements when necessary to allow a state to carry out an experimental project that is likely to promote the Act’s objectives. 

In 2010, the ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to include adults with household incomes less than 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Michigan passed legislation authorizing the Medicaid expansion but sought a waiver under Section 1115 to require new enrollees to pay premiums and copayments that could be reduced by the individual’s engagement in certain “healthy behaviors.” For enrollees with incomes above the FPL, the monthly premium was set at two percent of the individual’s income. DHHS granted the waiver application, effective through December 31, 2018, but specified that no individual may lose or be denied Medicaid eligibility for failure to pay premiums or copayments.

In January 2018, DHHS issued a letter to state Medicaid directors announcing its intention to approve Medicaid waiver applications containing work requirements. This action was consistent with President Trump's January 20, 2017 executive order instructing federal agencies to scale back the ACA “[t]o the maximum extent permitted by law."" 

In response, Michigan submitted a Section 1115 waiver application that would add mandatory work requirements. The work requirements consisted of 80 hours of specified work or work-related activities per month and mandatory monthly reporting of work activities, with the loss of coverage for enrollees who do not report the required hours for three months in a 12-month period. The application also included mandatory healthy behaviors and heightened, mandatory premiums for enrollees with incomes above the FPL who received coverage for 48 cumulative months. Failure to pay a premium within 60 days after the invoice date would result in termination of coverage. Enrollees in the same subgroup also had to complete a health risk assessment or specified healthy behaviors in the 12 months before their annual redetermination to remain eligible. 

DHHS approved these three HMP waivers, effective January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023, and granted Michigan permission to implement the measures starting January 1, 2020. The work requirements went into effect on January 1, 2020. The state deferred the implementation of the healthy behavior requirements and new premium requirements until October 1, 2020.

The plaintiffs, all members of Michigan’s Medicaid program, filed this class-action lawsuit on November 22, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The plaintiffs challenged amendments to the Healthy Michigan Plan (HMP), including work requirements that would result in the loss of health coverage for 61,000 to 183,000 individuals. Represented by the National Health Law Program, the Center for Civil Justice, and the Michigan Poverty Law Program, the plaintiffs requested an injunction against the defendants’ implementation of Michigan’s amended HMP eligibility requirements and declaratory relief. 

Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants failed to undergo the required rule-making process in issuing a new policy on Medicaid waivers and acted outside the scope of their waiver authority under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act in approving Michigan’s application that imposed additional Medicaid eligibility requirements. According to the plaintiffs, these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 551 <i>et seq.</i>), the Social Security Act, and the Take Care Clause in Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution.  The plaintiffs sued on their behalf and on behalf of all Michigan residents enrolled in the HMP on or after January 1, 2019.  

On February 19, 2020 the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) filed an unopposed motion to intervene, which was granted the next day.  On February 25, 2020, MDHHS filed a motion for partial summary judgment solely on the issue of whether the federal approval of the work and community-engagement requirements in the HMP section 1115 demonstration project was lawful.  In light of the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision in <i>Gresham v. Azar</i>, striking down the work requirements of the Arkansas Medicaid program under the Section 115 waiver, Judge Boasberg granted MDHHS’s motion for partial summary judgment.  The December 21, 2018 approval of the work and community engagement requirements in the Healthy Michigan Plan Amended Demonstration Extension Application by the defendant, Secretary Azar, was vacated.  Michigan could not enforce the Medicaid work or community engagement requirements that went into effect on January 1, 2020.

On April 2, 2020, MDHHS filed a motion to stay in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The same day, the court granted the motion and the case is stayed until the earlier of 1) the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, or 2) 45 days before the date Michigan begins to implement the premiums that are conditions of continued Medicaid eligibility or the healthy behavior requirements that are conditions of continued Medicaid eligibility.

As of June 2020, the Medicaid work and community engagement requirements cannot be enforced.  The plaintiffs challenged the  payment of premium and cost sharing, community engagement, and healthy behavior components of the HMP.  The plaintiffs did not specifically challenge the rest of the waiver, but the complaint asked the court to permanently enjoin the entire HMP.  When the case resumes, the court will need to decide on the appropriate remedy, whether to disband the entire HMP, or to only vacate some or all of the specifically challenged portions. 

<b>Background</b>

Medicaid beneficiaries in four other states have filed similar suits challenging the Administration's use of Section 1115 waiver authority. See <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16440""><i>Stewart v. Azar</i></a> (Kentucky), <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17162""><i>Gresham v. Azar</i></a> (Arkansas), <i>Philbrick v. Azar</i> (New Hampshire), and <i>Rose v. Azar</i> (Indiana). In <i>Stewart v. Azar</i>, the court struck down Kentucky's waiver, which included work requirements, on the basis that the agency failed to sufficiently consider the impact of the proposed project on Medicaid coverage. Similarly, in <i>Gresham v. Azar</i>, the court found that the agency failed to adequately consider how the imposition of work requirements in Arkansas's program would lead to loss of coverage for a substantial number of beneficiaries including the needy, a core group under Medicaid.","Attachments: # 1 Exhibit A, # 2 Civil Cover Sheet, # 3 Summons, # 4 Summons, # 5 Summons, # 6 Summons, # 7 Summons, # 8 Summons)(Perkins, Jane) (Entered: 11/22/2019)\n2 NOTICE OF RELATED CASE by All Plaintiffs. 18−cv−00152; 18−cv−01900; 19−cv−00773; 19−cv−02848.

DR-PA-0006,"On June 27, 2002, Barrier Busters (a disability advocacy group) and a class of disabled individuals filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the City of Erie, PA. The Plaintiffs alleged that the city of Erie had frequently failed to install mandatory curb cuts and to otherwise comply with the accessibility mandates of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 et seq., when it performed road and sidewalk construction and alterations since the ADA was passed in 1992.

The parties entered a court-approved Partial Consent Decree on March 18, 2003. On September 16, 2003, the parties entered a Second Partial Consent Decree and Partial Settlement; a third consent decree was entered on April 1, 2004, and a fourth on February 2, 2005. The Clearinghouse has not obtained these consent decrees, but it is clear from later documents that Erie made substantial commitments to both ensure adherence to the ADA curb cut requirements for new roads and future resurfacing projects, and to retrofit with curb cuts all areas where roads were built or resurfaced after the January 26, 1992 effective date of the ADA.  Erie committed to make annual reports showing where new road work had taken place and where new curb cuts were built. The consent agreements also recognized that Erie was not responsible for the non-compliance of state roads and highways in Erie that were resurfaced by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

In 2006, a separate case was filed against PennDOT, addressing the issues of ADA compliance and curb cuts on state roads in Erie. See <i>Voices for Independence v. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</i> in related cases. The plaintiffs in <i>Voices for Independence</i> were represented by the same attorneys as the plaintiffs in this case.

In 2010, the Plaintiffs observed that the City of Erie's street resurfacing in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 should have triggered the construction of ADA-compliant curb cuts, but none were built, contrary to the earlier agreements. On September 27, 2011, the court entered a stipulated order under which Erie agreed to retrofit these sites with curb cuts and to pay Plaintiffs $31,000 in attorneys' fees and costs for the period from March 11, 2011, to August 26, 2011. This stipulated order did not abrogate the earlier Consent Agreements.

Nevertheless, Erie failed to install curb cuts. In an attempt to correct the problem, the parties agreed to a second stipulated order on August 31, 2012. The city promised to take remedial action to install these curb cuts and agreed to pay an unspecified amount to the plaintiffs for attorneys' fees and costs.

On April 18, 2013, the Third Stipulated Order was entered, which changed Erie's reporting obligations to the plaintiffs to make the process more efficient. Erie agreed to pay an unspecified amount to the Plaintiffs for attorneys' fees and costs. The Third Stipulated Order was amended on May 22, 2014, to mandate that construction work performed on or before August 5 must include curb ramps within the same construction season. The City also committed to use “best efforts” to complete 70% of curb ramps within the same calendar year for construction performed after August 5; plaintiffs agreed that, when necessary, construction could be delayed until June 30 of the next calendar year. 

On March 11, 2015, plaintiffs moved to enforce the consent decrees. They alleged that the City violated the consent decrees for “an unspecified number of years” by installing fewer than six curb ramps at “T”-shaped intersections and fewer than eight curb ramps at “+”-shaped intersections. After discussions between the parties, Judge Baxter approved a fifth consent decree on May 27, 2015. The Fifth Consent Decree required the City to install 6 or 8 ramps, as appropriate, in all future construction. It also required the City to add ramps across the “leg” of the T in “T”-shaped intersections missing them at a rate of at least 75 ramps per year and included associated reporting requirements. 

Three years later, a new disagreement emerged about what kinds of intersections had to be retrofitted with curb ramps. Plaintiffs asserted that adding a thin layer of asphalt to a concrete intersection was an “alteration” under the ADA that required installation curb ramps. Erie disagreed. It argued that it is only required to add curb ramps when replacing old asphalt with new asphalt at asphalt intersections. On September 26, 2018, the court entered the Fourth Stipulated Order, which adopted plaintiffs’ view based on June, 2013 U.S. Department of Transportation guidelines. The Order required: <ul>
<li>Installation of curb ramps at previously altered asphalt intersections at a rate of at least 125 ramps per year, estimated to finish by the end of 2024. 
<li> Installation of at least 125 curb ramps at previously altered concrete intersections by the end of 2025. 
</ul>
However, the parties could not reach an agreement on whether there was a legal requirement to install curb ramps at concrete intersections altered prior to July, 2013. Erie preserved its right to litigate this issue in the Fourth Stipulated Order. 

As of March 29, 2021, the consent decrees and stipulated orders remain in effect. The defendants continue to file annual status reports. The most recent status report was filed on February 2, 2021 and the case is ongoing.

The number of ramps on Schedule C/D was 21. The contractor constructed 34 ramps on City streets intersecting State highways. The retrofit ramp locations on City streets are as listed in the H.R.

NH-MO-0001,"On March 14, 2013, the United States Department of Justice filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The United States sued a Marion County-owned skilled nursing facility, the operation of which was largely funded through Medicaid, under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), alleging that the Defendant had a practice of violating the constitutional and statutory rights of residents at the nursing home.  

Specifically, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant deliberately disregarded known harm or serious risks of harm to residents, and that its actions and failures to act caused harm to residents, including unnecessary segregation, and physical, mental and psychological harm. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant was violating the ADA by failing to serve individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, by not taking sufficient steps to assess, identify, and prepare individuals for discharge from the facility to programs in the community. The Plaintiff also alleged the Defendant failed to adequately screen individuals who are required by federal law to be screened before admission, resulting in individuals being served in a more restrictive setting than appropriate to their needs.  

The Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendant’s healthcare services “substantially depart from professional standards,” and thus failed to provide adequate healthcare, a constitutionally protected right. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to monitor, evaluate, update, or review individual’s care plans, despite new diagnoses or changes in conditions. For example, the Plaintiff alleged that on multiple occasions, residents showing symptoms of a stroke or began to foam at the mouth sometimes waited hours before nursing staff noticed or notified a physician.  These failures allegedly resulted in unnecessary harm, including hospitalization, preventable falls, and a decline in functional abilities.

Concurrently with the Complaint, the United States filed a settlement agreement, which it had already negotiated with the Defendant. The settlement involved a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment, and mandated improvements in three areas: (1) placement in the most integrated settings, (2) conditions of care and treatment, and (3) protection from harm. 

On March 22, 2013, Judge Charles A. Shaw for the United States District for the Eastern District of Missouri issued an order entering the settlement agreement as an order of the court. The Agreement provided for a third party to serve as the Monitor of compliance with the Agreement. The Agreement provided that it should terminate when the Defendant achieved substantial compliance with each provision of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance with the Agreement for a period of two years.

First, to ensure placement in the most integrated settings, the Agreement required the Defendant to conduct adequate pre-admission evaluations to ensure that individuals were not inappropriately admitted to the facility. The Defendant was also required to implement a discharge and transition process to ensure that individuals who could be served in more integrated settings were identified and that such individuals would be part of a robust and individualized discharge planning process and implementation. The Agreement also provided for “in-reach” by community service providers to residents to actively support them in moving to more integrated settings.

The Agreement established specific requirements for the “care plan,” or formal written individualized plan of treatment, required for each individual living at the nursing home and those at risk of being institutionalized there. 

The Defendant was required to implement a quality assurance process to oversee the discharge and transition process. It was required to review this information on a quarterly basis, and on an annual basis, create a report summarizing its quality assurance activities, findings, and recommendations, and evaluate whether it had been effective in addressing the barriers preventing individuals from receiving services in the most integrated, appropriate settings. 

Second, to improve the Defendant's conditions of care and treatment, the Agreement required the Defendant to provide individuals at Maple Lawn with adequate and appropriate protections, treatment, supports, and services to meet the individualized needs of the individuals and that are consistent with generally accepted professional standards. This involved the following: improving health care assessments and care plans, establishing an effective infection control program to minimize the spread of infections or communicable diseases, ensuring that nutrition and hydration services as well as aspiration prevention care were sufficient, improving its psychiatric and psychosocial services, specifically its policies about psychotropic medication, improving pressure sore prevention and treatment policies, providing adequate pain management services, mortality reviews for individuals who die at the Defendant’s facility or at an acute-care facility after being transferred from the Defendant’s facility, and annual quality assurance reporting.

Third, the Defendant was required to provide individuals with a safe and secure environment and ensure protection from harm. The Agreement mandated improvements in the Defendant's fall prevention and reporting policies, adequate reporting and investigation of all incidents where individuals sustain injuries, and annual quality assurance reporting.

The Agreement provided for a third party to serve as the Monitor of compliance with the Agreement. The Agreement provided that it should terminate when the Defendant achieved substantial compliance with each provision of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance with the Agreement for a period of two years.

The Monitor’s first Semi-Annual Compliance Report was adopted by the Defendant and filed with the court on September 19, 2013.

On January 30, 2014, the Plaintiff and Defendant filed a joint statement regarding Defendant’s compliance with the settlement agreement, informing the court that they both agreed with the Monitor’s finding that as of January 15, 2014, the Defendant had achieved substantial compliance with the terms of the Agreement.

For the next two years, the Monitor and Defendant filed semi-annual reports on compliance with the settlement agreement.

On April 15, 2016, the Plaintiff and Defendant filed a joint stipulation and motion for dismissal, in which they agreed and stipulated that the Defendant achieved substantial compliance on January 15, 2014 and remained in substantial compliance at all times through January 15, 2016.  The parties jointly stipulated to the dismissal of the action, and each paid its own costs.  District Judge Rodney W. Sippel dismissed the case, and the case is now closed.","[""U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division\nAssistant Attorney General 950 Pennsylvania Ave, NW - RFK Washington, DC 20530\nJanuary 25, 2011\nThe Honorable Lyndon Bode Presiding Commissioner Marion County Courthouse 100 South Main Street Palmyra, Missouri 63461-1661\nRe: Investigation of the Maple Lawn Nursing Home, Palmyra, Missouri\nDear Commissioner Bode:\nWe write to report the findings of the Civil Rights Division’s investigation into the conditions, practices, care, and treatment of individuals at the Maple Lawn Nursing Home (“Maple Lawn”) in Palmyra, Missouri. Many staff members genuinely care for the well-being of those who reside at the facility. See Lankford v. Sherman, 451 F.3d 496, 512 (8th Cir. Accord Press Release, The White House, “President Obama Commemorates Anniversary of Olmstead and Announces New Initiatives to Assist Americans with Disabilities” (June 22, 2009) (in announcing the Year of Community Living Initiative, President Obama affirmed “one of the most fundamental rights of Americans with disabilities: having the choice to live independently. See, e.g., Radaszewski v. Maram, 383 F.3d 599 (7th Cir. According to Maple Lawn, few individuals have mental or developmental disabilities. Moreover, there is no evidence that Maple Lawn has contacted either the State or local developmental disability office to arrange for an assessment of B.B.’s capabilities and needs.\nMaple Lawn’s failure to have an adequate admissions process in place, including its failure to adequately conduct PASRR screens, is leading to individuals being served in more restrictive settings than appropriate to their needs, in violation of the ADA.\n2. These services can include catheter care, bowel and bladder assistance, and assistance that requires the use of lift equipment.\nIn sum, even the individuals that Maple Lawn believes are ready for community placement remain improperly institutionalized in the nursing home in violation of their rights under the ADA because of Maple Lawn’s inadequate discharge planning process.\n3. F.F. uses a wheelchair and needs assistance with his ADLs. In July 2009, I.I. indicated a preference to return to the community. Nursing staff failed to initiate life saving efforts despite clear indications to do so. Ms. J. needlessly suffered before she died. She was unresponsive and totally dependent on nursing staff to assist with her daily needs. The lack of medical and nursing interventions and monitoring likely contributed to her death.\n\uf0b7 In October 2009, I.I. lost 18 pounds, yet Maple Lawn staff failed to adequately assess and monitor his condition. Maple Lawn Fails to Adequately Treat Individuals with Pressure Sore and Skin Care Needs\nWe find that individuals at Maple Lawn are suffering painful and preventable pressure sores due to unlawfully inadequate services. Even more troubling, Maple Lawn did not have a clearly defined set of policies and procedures guiding pressure sore prevention and treatment. As a result, Mr. L. developed a Stage II pressure sore9 on his heel and Stage I pressure sore on his coccyx. It is most likely that the wound was present in some stage prior to her hospital admission, yet Maple Lawn nursing staff failed to assess, develop a care plan, or treat P.P.’s condition.\n\uf0b7 Z.Z., another totally dependent individual who was known to be at risk for skin breakdown and required repositioning in her bed, developed a facility-acquired pressure sore. It must also take all reasonable steps to protect those who live at the facility from harm. Staff discovered U.U. with a large bruise under her right eye. Maple Lawn’s manual was inadequate in both scope and implementation. Each assessment should track and calculate calories, proteins, carbohydrates, and specific nutrition and hydration needs. Any individual who loses five percent of total body weight in one month or 10 percent in six months should be re-evaluated and nursing staff shall contact the attending physician.\nNursing staff, along with assistance from restorative staff, should conduct daily monitoring of each individual's food and fluid intake. Maple Lawn should ensure that nursing staff are conducting pain assessments, implementing appropriate interventions, and monitoring individual pain to ensure that medications are administered as needed. Specifically, Maple Lawn investigators should visit the scene of an alleged incident, collect physical evidence, and obtain witness accounts. Grace, 589 F.3d at 930 n.6.\nRisk Management Practices\nIn order to reduce harm from inadequate staffing, substandard care, hazardous environmental conditions, and dangerous narcotics control practices, Maple Lawn should establish a comprehensive risk management system.\nMaple Lawn should provide a sufficient number of qualified nurses to meet the total nursing care needs within the facility twenty-four hours per day, seven days a week. Defendant conducts an inadequate Preadmission Screening and Resident Review (""PASRR"") process that is required by 42 U.S.C. § 1396r(e)(7) and 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.100 to 483.138. Maple Lawn fails prior to admission to identify individuals with mental illness or developmental disabilities and/or conduct secondary screens and offer community alternatives to individuals who are identified through initial screening. Defendant fails to monitor, evaluate, update, or review individual\'s care plans for serious medical needs, despite new diagnoses or changes in individuals\' conditions. This failure to provide adequate care for individuals\' serious medical needs departs substantially from generally accepted professional standards and results in unnecessary harm, including repeated preventable falls.\n24. In violation of constitutional standards, Defendant fails to provide individuals at Maple Lawn with a safe enviromnent or to protect individuals from harm or risk of harm in a substantial departure from generally accepted professional standards. Defendant fails to provide adequate repositioning and continence care.

PA-NC-0004,"This is one of several federal lawsuits addressing North Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (HB2), which was passed on March 23, 2016.  For the others, see the <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?saveRef=pl&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BspecialCollection%7C43%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B"">case collection.</a>

On February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed Ordinance 7056, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in public accommodations, passenger vehicle for hire, and city contractors. The city ordinance was set to take effect on April 1, 2016.

In response, on March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature held a special session and passed House Bill 2; it was signed that same day by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. HB2 prohibited municipalities in North Carolina from enacting anti-discrimination policies and removed the statutory and common-law private right of action to enforce state anti-discrimination statutes in state courts. It also required that individuals only be permitted to use bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates while in government buildings.  For many transgender people, this prevented them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity (in North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery can change the sex on their birth certificates; some other jurisdictions have even more restrictive rules).  In addition, the legislation changed the definition of sex in the state's anti-discrimination law to ""the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate,” which prevented discrimination against transgender people from being classified as a type of sex discrimination. 

On May 4, in a letter to Governor Pat McCrory, the Justice Department informed him that the U.S. had concluded that HB2 violated federal law.  The DOJ <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/north-carolina-hb2/481347/"">asked</a> the Governor to respond by close of business on May 9, and that he remedy the violations, ""including by confirming that the State will not comply with or implement H.B. 2.""

Instead of providing the demanded assurances, the Governor sued the United States on the morning of May 9, in the Eastern District of North Carolina, seeking a declaratory judgment that HB2 did not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq.), or the Violence Against Woman Act (42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)).  That case is in the Clearinghouse as <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15316"">PA-NC-0003</a>, and is described there. A few hours later, the U.S. filed this lawsuit, seeking to enjoin operation of HB2, in the U.S District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The DOJ sued the State of North Carolina under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq.), under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.), and under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)). The DOJ sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the U.S. asked the Court to find that HB 2’s Part I—the part that instructs public agencies to deny transgender individuals access to multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities consistent with their gender identity--violated federal law, and to issue an injunction ordering the state to stop violating the federal laws in question.

North Carolina’s former Attorney General, Roy Cooper, had <a href="" http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article68780957.html"">said</a> that he agreed that HB2 is illegal, and declined to defend it against this and the other lawsuits challenging it.

On June 10, 2016 the United States and the Defendants issued a joint motion to enjoin automatic suspension of funds received under the Violence Against Women Act that prohibits recipients of federal funds administered by the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women (“OVW”) from engaging in discrimination based on sex and gender identity. The United States and the Defendants agreed that the suspension of funds would on balance harm the public interest. On June 23, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder granted the parties' joint motion to enjoin the United States from automatically withholding funds. 192 F.Supp.3d 620. 

On June 29, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder granted Phil Berger, President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate, and Tim Moore, Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, the right to permissively intervene as defendants in the case. Several other private individuals requested to intervene on either side of the case and their motions were denied. 

On July 14, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder ordered that parties in the four related cases of HB2 file a short joint notice identifying any agreements reached and explaining their respective positions. On July 25, 2016, the Court consolidated this case with <i>Carcaño v. McCrory</i>(1:16CV236), <i>Berger v. United States</i> (1:16CV844), and <i>North Carolinians for Privacy v. United States</i> (1:16CV845) for discovery purposes only. After this consolidation, the Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed <i>Berger v. United States</i> on July 28, 2016, and <i>North Carolinians for Privacy v. United States</i> on August 31, 2016.

On August 12, 2016, the Defendants submitted motions to stay the proceedings in light of the Supreme Court hearing the <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14977"">G.G.</a> case regarding similar issues. Ten days later, the United States submitted a response in opposition to the Defendants' request to stay the proceedings. The United States stated that the Defendants were violating federal laws and that the proceedings should not be delayed in anticipation of a change in the law. 

On December 16, 2016, upon the joint motion of the parties and in the interest of judicial economy, the court stayed the proceedings in the case and in the related case of <i>Carcano v. McCrory</i> (1:16CV236) pending disposition in the Supreme Court of Gloucester County School Board v. G.G., No. 16- 273 (S. Ct.). At the United States’ request, the court did not include the United States’ pending motion for preliminary injunction in the stay. 

On January 1, 2017, Roy Cooper, who opposed HB2 as NC Attorney General, took office as Governor of North Carolina, changing the Governor’s position. On February 22, 2017, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, under President Trump, withdrew and rescinded their earlier guidance documents, changing the federal government’s position. On March 2, 2017, the Plaintiff submitted a request to expand the stay (granted on December 16, 2016) to include the preliminary injunction request, on the grounds that the United States had withdrawn two guidance documents upon which the motion was based. 

On March 28, 2017, the Plaintiff submitted a joint status report with the Carcaño Plaintiffs, UNC Defendants, Legislative Defendants, and the State Defendants. The United States aligned itself with the UNC and Legislative Defendants requesting that the court leave the stay entered on December 16, 2016, until resolution of the pending appeals in <i>G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board</i> (4th Cir. No. 15-2056) and <i>Carcaño v. Cooper</i> (4th Cir. No. 16-1989). The Carcaño Plaintiffs and the State Defendants requested that the stay be lifted so that parties could confer about a new discovery plan. 

On March 30, 2017, the North Carolina Legislature, and the newly appointed Governor enacted House Bill 142 which, among other things, repealed HB2. The repeal included a compromise that left many on both sides unhappy. The compromise prevented municipalities from passing anti-discrimination laws until December 2020, and the legislature still had the ability to regulate bathrooms. 

On April 14, 2017, the Plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal stating that in light of the passage of House Bill 142, the claims and causes of actions against the Defendants would be dismissed with prejudice, which closed the case.

(“ This Court has the authority to enter a declaratory judgment and to provide preliminary and permanent injunctive relief pursuant to Rules 57 and 65 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure; 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202; 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e-6(a) and (b); 20 U.S.C. § 1682; and 42 U.S.C. §§ 13925(b)(13)(C) and 3789d(c)(3).\nDEFENDANTS 6. Defendant Patrick McCrory is the Governor of North Carolina. Defendant McCrory is a person within the meaning of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e(a). Defendant North Carolina Department of Public Safety is an agency of the State of North Carolina responsible for public safety, corrections and emergency management. Defendant University of North Carolina is a public, multi-campus university that is organized under, and exists pursuant to, the laws of the State of North Carolina. It is currently and, at all times relevant to the Complaint, has been a recipient of federal funds from the United States Department of Justice, including the Office on Violence Against Women, with open grants dated after the reauthorization of VAWA on March 19, 2013. As a condition of receiving federal funds, Defendant University of North Carolina signed contract assurances agreeing that it will not discriminate in violation of federal law.\n10. Defendant Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina is the corporate body charged with the general control, supervision, and governance of the University of North Carolina and is capable under North Carolina law of suing and being sued in any court.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS Enactment of H.B. 2\n11. H.B. 2 mandates, inter alia, that all “[p]ublic agencies . . . require multiple occupancy bathrooms or changing facilities . . . be designated for and only used by individuals based on their biological sex.” H.B. 2 defines “biological sex” as “[t]he physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person’s birth certificate.” H.B. 2 was enacted in direct response to Ordinance 7056 passed by the City Council in Charlotte, North Carolina (the “Charlotte Ordinance”), which permitted transgender individuals to use facilities corresponding to their gender identity by prohibiting discrimination based on “gender identity” in places of public accommodation.\n14. Governor McCrory signed the bill that night. Following the conclusion of the special session, Senate President Phil Berger stated on his website, “[t]he North Carolina Senate voted unanimously Wednesday [March 23, 2016] to stop a radical and illegal Charlotte City Council ordinance allowing men into public bathrooms and locker rooms with young girls and women.” Lieutenant Governor Dan Forest stated that the Charlotte Ordinance “would have given pedophiles, sex offenders, and perverts free rein to watch women, boys, and girls undress and use the bathroom. On April 5, 2016, following the enactment of H.B. 2, Defendant University of North Carolina’s President, Margaret Spellings, issued a Memorandum to all Chancellors in the University of North Carolina system, titled “Guidance – Compliance with the Public Facilities Privacy & Security Act.” As a federal funding agency, when the Department of Justice has reason to question a funding recipient’s compliance with Title IX, it gives notice of non-compliance and attempts to secure the recipient’s compliance through voluntary means.\n-5-\nCase 1:16-cv-00425 Document 1 Filed 05/09/16 Page 5 of 14\n\n\x0c22. On April 8, 2016, the United States sent a letter to President Spellings seeking information to determine whether the University was complying with federal law.\n23. The United States advised Defendants that it would take enforcement action under the above statutes if such compliance with federal law was not demonstrated.\n29. Individuals are typically assigned a sex on their birth certificate solely on the basis of the appearance of the external genitalia at birth. An individual’s “sex” consists of multiple factors, which may not always be in alignment. Among those factors are hormones, external genitalia, internal reproductive organs, chromosomes, and gender identity, which is an individual’s internal sense of being male or female. For individuals who have aspects of their sex that are not in alignment, the person’s gender identity is the primary factor in terms of establishing that person’s sex. External genitalia are, therefore, but one component of sex and not always determinative of a person’s sex. Although there is not yet one definitive explanation for what determines gender identity, biological factors, most notably sexual differentiation in the brain, have a role in gender identity development.\n-7-\nCase 1:16-cv-00425 Document 1 Filed 05/09/16 Page 7 of 14\n\n\x0c34. Transgender individuals are individuals who have a gender identity that does not match the sex they were assigned at birth. A transgender man’s sex is male and a transgender woman’s sex is female.\n35. The decision by transgender individuals to assert their gender identity publicly is a deeply personal one that is made by the individual, often in consultation with family, medical and health care providers, and others.\n36. Gender identity and transgender status are inextricably linked to one’s sex and are sex-related characteristics.\n38. Most states authorize changing the sex marker on one’s birth certificate, but the requirements for doing so vary and are often onerous. Specifically, many states require surgical procedures. At least one state does not allow persons to change the sex marker on their birth certificates.\n39. Surgery related to gender transitioning is generally unavailable to children under age 18.\n41. In addition, the great majority of transgender individuals do not have surgery as part of their gender transition. Determinations about such surgery are decisions about medical\n-8-\nCase 1:16-cv-00425 Document 1 Filed 05/09/16 Page 8 of 14\n\n\x0ccare made by physicians and patients on an individual basis. For some, health-related conditions or other medical criteria counsel against invasive surgery. For others, the high cost of surgical procedures, which are often excluded from health insurance coverage, present an insurmountable barrier.\n42. The compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2 by Defendants University of North Carolina and Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina stigmatizes and singles out transgender individuals, results in their isolation and exclusion, and perpetuates a sense that they are not worthy of equal treatment and respect.\n49. Because of the compliance with and implementation of H.B. 2 by Defendants North Carolina Department of Public Safety, University of North Carolina, and Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina, individuals who are not transgender may access bathrooms and changing facilities that are consistent with their gender identity in covered facilities, while individuals who are transgender may not access bathrooms and changing facilities that are consistent with their gender identity.\n51. As alleged in this Complaint, Defendants State of North Carolina, North Carolina Department of Public Safety, University of North Carolina, and Board of Governors of the University of North Carolina are engaged in, and continue to engage in, a pattern or practice of sex discrimination in the terms, conditions, and privileges of employment against their transgender employees in violation Title VII.\n54.

PB-MI-0026,"On July 12, 1999, several medical, dental, and child advocacy organizations, along with several individuals, filed this class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the directors of the Michigan Department of Health, the Medical Services Administration, the Michigan Medical Services Administration, and the Michigan Department of Community Health under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by The Public Interest Law Center, in collaboration with Dechert LLP, Michigan Legal Services, the National Health Law Project, and the Michigan Association for Children with Emotional Disorders, sought injunctive relief to prevent state officials from violating the Medicaid law, claiming violations of federal Medicaid laws. 

The plaintiffs alleged that the state of Michigan failed to provide essential dental and medical services, known as Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Services (“EPSDT services”) required by the Medicaid program to eligible minors. The plaintiffs alleged that Michigan’s Medicaid system paid doctors and dentists too little to ensure that they would be willing to treat patients on Medicaid, such that low-income families faced a dangerous shortage of essential care for their children. The case was assigned to Judge Robert H. Cleland.

On October 14, 1999, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification of children eligible for EPSDT services. 

On November 9, 1999, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Clearinghouse does not have access to this document so it is unclear by what reasoning the defendants sought judgment. 

On December 28, 1999, Judge Robert H. Cleland granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Clearinghouse does not have access to this document so it is unclear which parts were granted or denied. 

On March 26, 2001, Judge Cleland entered an order denying the plaintiffs’ motion to certify the class and granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss. Judge Cleland held that the substantive defendant, in this case, was the state of Michigan and that Ex parte Young was inapplicable, meaning state sovereign immunity doctrine barred this type suit against the state. While the Constitution says that federal statutes are the “supreme law of the land,” Judge Cleland ruled that because the Medicaid program was enacted under Congress’ spending power and is a consensual, contractual agreement between the states and Congress, it is not encompassed by the supremacy clause. Thus, Congress cannot compel states to participate in the program and individual state actors, indistinguishable from the state, retain “constitutional sovereignty from the suit.” 133 F.Supp.2d 549.

Judge Cleland also held that even if there were no immunity from these suits, Section 1983 did not authorize suits against states or state officials for failure to carry out the terms of a federal grant program like Medicaid. The Supreme Court has required a historical statutory construction when construing Section 1983 and Judge Cleland found “no such clear, unambiguous intent to subject States to private suit.” 133 F.Supp.2d 549.

On April 4, 2001, the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit (Circuit Judges Merritt, Boggs, and Moore) delivered its opinion on May 15, 2002, in which it reversed the district court’s decision on all issues presented. The court held that conditions imposed by the federal government upon states participating in Medicaid do not arise out of a contractual agreement; they are federal laws. The court also ruled, in line with “well-established precedent,” that laws passed by Congress under its spending powers are supreme law of the land. Furthermore, while the district court ruled that Ex parte Young was unavailable to the plaintiffs, the Sixth Circuit held that because the plaintiffs sought relief from state officials for those officials’ alleged violations of federal law, this case was squarely within Ex parte Young and thus allowed to proceed. Lastly, the court held that the plaintiffs did have a cause of action under Section 1983. The case was remanded back to the district court. 289 F.3d 852. 

With the case back in the district court, the plaintiffs moved for class certification on October 14, 2015, and filed an amended complaint on October 18, 2015. The Clearinghouse does not have access to these documents so it is unclear what was different in the amended complaint. 

Accordingly, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment on November 29, 2004. 

On April 22, 2005, Judge Cleland granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ 2004 motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment. Judge Cleland addressed the plaintiffs’ claim that the defendants failed to provide EPSDT services to all eligible children by holding that plaintiffs stated a cause of action to the extent that they alleged that the state of Michigan has a policy or practice of not providing the EPSDT services to eligible children who have requested them. Addressing the plaintiffs’ second claim, Judge Cleland held that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action because the Medicaid statute did not “unambiguously confer rights enforceable under Section 1983.” Finally, Judge Cleland denied the plaintiffs’ final claim that the defendants failed to adequately inform eligible individuals of programs and services available through Medicare, holding that it was not their duty to inform all potentially eligible children of EPSDT services. 368 F.Supp.2d 740.

On May 17, 2005, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and entered judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed this judgment the next day. 

On July 7, 2006, the Sixth Circuit (again before Judges Merritt, Moore, and now Chief Judge Boggs) affirmed in part the district court’s dismissal of the claims under the Medicaid statutory provisions but reversed the holding that there was no cause of action for failing to inform all potentially eligible children of EPSDT services. The appeals court also modified the district court’s order to reflect a dismissal without prejudice, which allowed the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint to allege that Michigan's inadequate payment system effectively denied many eligible children the right to medical assistance. The case was remanded back to the district court. 454 F.3d 532. 

On October 11, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in the district court. The complaint alleged that the reimbursement rates provided by the defendants were so low that an insufficient number of providers were willing to care for children who were enrolled in Medicaid. The plaintiffs further claimed that these inadequate payments effectively denied the plaintiffs and the class of minors eligible for Medicaid represented in the suit the right to medical assistance. 

On August 7, 2007, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement that resulted in the case being dismissed without prejudice. The settlement preserved significant expansions of the state’s program and major increases in rates paid to doctors and dentists for treating Medicaid patients. The settlement also required the state to monitor children’s access to care, which it had never done before the settlement. Finally, the settlement provided for ongoing oversight of the state’s program by representatives of the plaintiffs. 

The case is now closed. ","['Westside Mothers v. Haveman, 133 F.Supp.2d 549 (2001) 73 Soc.

The Court Lacks Authority to Compel State Officers Performing Discretionary Functions\nUnder the doctrine of Ex parte Young:\nThere is no doubt that the [federal] court cannot control the exercise of the discretion of an officer. 2304 (internal citations and quotations omitted). 137\nto the Supreme Court cases of the period following § 1983’s enactment, which repeatedly held that state officers could not be enjoined to perform a State’s contractual obligations because they were not parties to the contracts in their personal capacity.\nTo begin, in Louisiana v. Jumel, 107 U.S. 711, 2 S.Ct. Moreover, their employer, Michigan, as the only real party to the contract alleged to be in breach, is immune from suit.16\nPlaintiffs argue that the status of agency law in the 1870s is unclear, and that cases exist in which courts enjoined state officers to enforce state contracts. In the absence of a clear declaration by Michigan in the case at bar that it has waived its sovereign immunity, and by extension, the immunity of its officers, it cannot be subjected to suit.\nAnother point warranting brief mention revolves around plaintiffs’ supposition that the legislative history of the Medicaid Act and its subsequent amendments are demonstrative of Congress’ intent that states participating in the Medicaid program be subject to private suit. The reasons that Congress may choose to act or to refrain from acting are probably more numerous than its members, and there is no judicially-cognizable intent derivable from a political institution’s failure to act. For purposes of the analyses in this opinion, the court will\n\nassume, without so holding, that they are intentional third-party beneficiaries of the contract.\n\n9\n\nIt is difficult to imagine how it might be, in light of the Supreme Court’s apparent holding in Kimel that § 5 of the Fourteenth\n\nAmendment, at most, grants Congress the authority to abrogate State sovereign immunity only in the areas of racial and gender\n\ndiscrimination. 42 U.S.C. § 1396c.\nMichigan has elected to participate in the Medicaid program.

See id.\nTo hold steadfast, under the law of the case doctrine, and to simply apply the Sixth Circuit’s conclusion that “Plaintiffs have a cause of action under § 1983 for *755 alleged noncompliance with the screening and treatment provisions of the Medicaid Act” would require this court to ignore intervening and controlling United States Supreme Court authority which has altered the analysis, at least in applying the first Blessing factor, for all federal courts. 2889, 90 L.Ed.2d 976 (1986); Continental Bank & Trust Co. v.

Although Frazar is a case very different from this one procedurally, it presents a case with very similar factual allegations.\n*766 The plaintiffs in Frazar were mothers of children eligible for EPSDT services in Texas.

Compare Long Term Care Pharmacy Alliance v. Ferguson, 362 F.3d 50, 56 (1st Cir.2004) (no rights creating language); Sanchez v.

However, the Plaintiffs who have been determined to be eligible for EPSDT services and who have requested them, have stated a claim to enforce rights created by § 1396a(a)(43).\nDefendants’ motion for summary judgment pursuant to Rule 56 is DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE.\n\nIn summary, Plaintiffs have failed to state a claim to the extent that they alleged failure by Defendants in their official capacity to ensure the actual provision of, or arrangement for, medical services.

Halderman (“Pennhurst I ”), the Court described the Medicaid program as “much in the nature of a contract,” and spoke of the “ ‘contract’ ” formed between the state and the federal government.\n451 U.S. 1, 17, 101 S.Ct.

FA-GA-0001,"On October 5, 2012, the Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta, the Catholic Diocese of Savannah, and affiliated Catholic organizations filed this U.S. District Court lawsuit in the Northern District of Georgia against the Federal Government under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the First and Fifth Amendments, and as a violation of the Constitution's Separation of Powers provisions.  Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, seek to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage.  Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their sincerely held religious beliefs.

Plaintiffs amended their complaint a first time on December 31, 2012, and a second time on August 19, 2013 to challenge the ACA as amended by the 2013 Final Rules. They argued that while the Diocese itself likely fell within the ""religious employer"" exception, the affiliated Catholic entities did not and, instead, were considered ""eligible organizations"" qualifying for an accommodation. The accommodation would require plaintiffs to provide self-certification to their insurance provider setting forth their religious objections to the ACA, in turn trigging an obligation on the part of the insurance provider to procure the services plaintiffs find objectionable. According to the plaintiffs, this series of events makes them the but-for cause of providing contraception coverage in violation of their sincerely held beliefs. Plaintiffs continued to ask the court to grant a permanent injunction against enforcement of the relevant provisions of the ACA.

On March 26, 2014, the District Court (Judge William S. Duffey, Jr.) permanently enjoined the government from enforcing the contraceptive mandate against plaintiffs. 2014 WL 1256373. The court noted that the contraception mandate, including the self-certification form, placed a substantial burden on plaintiffs by compelling them to affirmatively modify their behavior and violate their religious beliefs. The court also held that the general applicability of the law was not a compelling state interest nor was the conception mandate the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. On May 23, 2014, the government appealed this case to the Eleventh Circuit. 

On May 30, 2014, Judge Duffey issued an opinion and order in response to the government's motion for Reconsideration on the Dioceses' RFRA and free exercise claims. 2014 WL 2441742. The government had also asked the court to reconsider whether or not the affiliated entities maintained a ""church plan"" under ERISA. If they did, they would be exempt from the self-certification requirement, and not have standing to challenge the mandate. Judge Duffey held that the Dioceses' RFRA and free exercise claims should be dismissed, and clarified that the affiliated organizations did not need to establish that they were church plans, because the self-certification requirement was a substantial burden on their religious exercise. 

This case was consolidated on appeal with <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13619"">Eternal Word Television Network v. Sebelius</a>. On February 18, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit (Judge Jill Pryor) held that the contraception mandate does not violate the RFRA because it is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest, but enjoined enforcement of the mandate against the plaintiffs because the issue of whether the accommodation violates the RFRA was currently before the Supreme Court. 818 F.3d 1122. 

On May 31, 2016, following the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13465"">Zubik v. Sebelius [II]</a> that religious nonprofits and the government should return the related cases to the courts of appeals and attempt to negotiate a solution, the Eleventh Circuit vacated their February 19, 2016 order in this case, and directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing. 

On July 29, 2016 the parties jointly moved for a stay in the proceedings that was granted on August 10, 2016. The parties were ordered to file status reports sixty days after the given order. 

Also on August 10, 2016, the defendants moved for an order materially identical to the remand orders the Supreme Court issued in <i> Zubik </i>. The defendants moved for this motion because they wanted to modify the existing injunction against them and have the ability to tell insurance issuers and third party administrators of their requirement to make separate payments for contraceptives given the plaintiffs met the requirements under the accommodation. This would ensure the affected women that would be under the plaintiffs insurance receive coverage while the litigation continued. The plaintiffs opposed the motion. 

On October 3, 2016, the court granted the defendant's motion for materially identical orders. The new injunction stated: 

“As such, we modify the injunction entered on May 31, 2016 to add that: Nothing in this opinion, [in this Court's prior opinion or orders], or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that women covered by the [plaintiffs'] health plans ""obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives."" Through this litigation, [plaintiffs] have made the Government aware of their view that they meet ""the requirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds. Nothing in this opinion, [in this Court's prior opinions or orders], or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, ""precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of frill contraceptive coverage"" going forward. Because the Government may rely on this notice, the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on [plaintiffs] for failure to provide the relevant notice.”

Both parties filed status reports on October 11, 2016, stating the defendants were sorting through the 52,000 comments received during the governments’ Request for Information (RFI) and required additional time to determine if modifications were necessary to accommodate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act claim still pending. 

The parties then continued to file monthly status reports with no changes to the case until October 16, 2017. However, during this time President Trump issued an executive order in May of 2017, called the ""Executive Order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty"". As a result, on October 6, 2017, the US Department of Health and Human Services released a statement explaining the changes in policy related to President Trump's executive order requiring HHS to consider amending the accommodation requirements under the ACA for the contraception mandate. The new policy would expand the exception to fit entities that had sincerely held religious beliefs opposed to providing contraception. 
<a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/10/06/trump-administration-issues-rules-protecting-the-conscience-rights-of-all-americans.html""> Here is an article from HHS describing the change.</a>

On October 16, 2017, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the case, with each party bearing its own costs. 

On November 7, 2017, the court dismissed the appeal. 

This case is now presumed closed.

On January 27, 2012, Archbishop Gregory drafted a letter to the parishioners of the Atlanta Archdiocese objecting to the U.S. Government Mandate. The benefits departments must then develop options to be presented to committees that are responsible for benefits issues. Plaintiffs have no adequate remedy at law. The Mandate is irreconcilable with the First Amendment, RFRA, and other laws. The Atlanta Archdiocese carries out a tripartite spiritual, educational, and social service mission. Consequently, Plaintiffs allege that the purpose of the Mandate, including the narrow Exemption, is to discriminate against religious institutions and organizations that oppose abortion and contraception.\nTHE MANDATE IS NOT THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE MEANS OF FURTHERING A COMPELLING GOVERNMENTAL INTEREST\n128. Specifically, after March 23, 2010, the Atlanta Archdiocese would have introduced some combination of increased employee premium contributions, deductibles, and/or co-pays to preserve the financial stability of both the Atlanta Plan and the Atlanta Archdiocese, but they cannot do so for fear of losing grandfathered status. 8 The FFE is the fee required to be paid by TPAs and insurers who participate in the health care exchanges established by the ACA.\n10\n\n\x0cCase 1:12-cv-03489-WSD Document 108 Filed 03/26/14 Page 11 of 91\nbeneficiary.

Defendants argue that this case is one where the requirement imposed on\nthe Plaintiffs is the simple completion of the self-certification form that is no burden at all.

If CENGI and Catholic Charities cancel their health plans altogether to avoid the contraceptive mandate, they may be subject to an annual penalty of $2,000 per full-time employee.\nThe Court concludes that the plain terms of the Final Rules show that the purpose and effect of the self-certification form is to enable the provision of contraceptive coverage. Professor Harrington’s\naffidavit is equally speculative because it does not offer any evidence to support\nthe allegation that the Plaintiffs will pay for or subsidize the costs of contraceptive coverage.19 The Plaintiffs also ignore that the Final Rules require the TPA to\nprovide coverage for preventive services “without cost sharing, premium, fee, or\nother charge to plan participants or beneficiaries, or to the eligible organization or\n19 Plaintiffs do not specify whether each non-exempt affiliate bears its own health care costs.

The Government has thus claimed in these other church plan cases that it does not have authority to force a TPA to provide contraceptive services if the TPA refuses to do so. Roman Catholic Archbishop of Washington, 2013 WL 6729515, at *26-27. That the Government examined the practices of religious organizations in 28 states across the country during the rulemaking process also shows that the Government considered the views of those opposed to the contraceptive mandate.

Under the HRSA guidelines, the contraceptive mandate does not apply to a group health plan run by a religious employer, defined by the regulations as “an organization that is organized and operates as a nonprofit entity and is referred to in section 6033(a)(3)(A)(i) or (iii) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended.” Id. at 715-17.\nAssuming, arguendo, that the act of filling out Form 700 or notifying HHS implicates the Free Speech Clause, this Court must ask whether the government’s “countervailing interest is sufficiently compelling to justify” the forced speech. If a third-party administrator agrees to provide the contraceptive coverage, the costs it incurs to do so will be reimbursed from “Federally-facilitated Exchange” user fees, which are fees\n14 Under ERISA, a third-party administrator that is neither the “plan sponsor” nor specifically designated as such can be considered the “plan administrator” only “as the Secretary [of Labor] may by regulation prescribe.” 2d 675 (2014).\nFollowing the enactment of the ACA and the promulgation of the contraceptive mandate, a diverse set of employers brought suit to avoid providing what they viewed as objectionable contraceptive coverage.18 The Supreme Court\n18 Though the bulk of this litigation has been brought under RFRA, at least one nonreligious employer has challenged the contraceptive mandate under the Fifth Amendment.

PC-NJ-0026,"This is a case about the unfair business practices of Global Tel*Link, a private company with a state granted monopoly on telephone services in New Jersey's prison systems. On August 20, 2013 the plaintiffs, people incarcerated in New Jersey prisons and people who created accounts with Global Tel*Link to receive calls from New Jersey prisoners, filed this class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it was assigned to United States District Judge William J. Martini. The plaintiffs sued Global Tel*Link and several associated companies, alleging violations of New Jersey's Consumer Fraud and Public Utilities statutes, the Federal Communications Act (42 U.S.C. § 201), the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201). They plaintiffs also brought a common law unjust enrichment claim. In their § 1983 count, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants, acting on behalf of the State of New Jersey, imposed unconscionable fees and rates on plaintiffs, which amounted to a  violation of the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on the taking of property without just compensation. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages, disgorgment, restitution, and prejudgment interest, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. Specifically, they claimed that the defendant's billing policies were ""abusive, discriminatory, and unreasonable."" 

In 2006, Global Tel*Link, an Alabama company that provides telecommunications services and surveillance technology to correctional institutions, bought the contractual right to be the sole provider of telecommunications for prisons and many county jails in New Jersey. The plaintiffs in this case alleged that Global Tel*Link abused its monopoly power by charging plaintiffs exorbitant rates, forcing friends and family of incarcerated people to create prepaid accounts with minimum payments of $25 to receive calls from their loved ones, forfeiting money from prepaid accounts when they went unused for 90 days, and failing to disclose rates, fees, and billing practices. The defendants paid commissions, sometimes exceeding 50% of their revenue, to the correctional agency they contracted with. To turn a profit the defendants charged exceedingly high rates for calls and imposed numerous fees, such a 19% fee on deposits to the prepaid accounts.

On November 22, 2013, the defendants moved to dismiss the case, arguing that it should have been brought as a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) instead. At that time, the FCC had been in the process of determining whether the defendants' business practices were violations of the Federal Communications Act, as alleged in this lawsuit. On September 8, 2014, the court issued an opinion denying the motion to dismiss, but staying the case until the conclusion of the FCC's proceedings. The plaintiffs responded on September 19, 2014 by withdrawing their Federal Communications Act claim, as well as their claim under New Jersey Public Utilities Statutes.

After close to a year of discovery disputes, on August 7, 2015, the defendants moved to compel arbitration based on arbitration clauses in their products' terms of use. On February 11, 2016, Judge Martini denied the motion with respect to all but one of the plaintiffs. He found that the recorded message notifying Global Tel*Link users of its terms of use, including the arbitration provision, did not inform most of the plaintiffs that they would have to abide by Global Tel*link's terms of use to use its services. Consequently, the court held the plaintiffs did not enter into a legally enforceable contract with the defendants. One of the named plaintiffs who created their account through the defendants' website, which used a different system, was forced to arbitrate their claim. 

On June 15, 2016, the defendants filed a motion with the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate this case with several others on which prisoners and their families were suing Global Tel*Link. The Panel denied that request in an October 13, 2015 order, docketed as JPML No. 2651, Entry 23.

The defendants appealed Judge Martini's arbitration decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on March 9, 2016. On March 29, 2017, the Third Circuit affirmed Judge Martini's ruling in an opinion by Judge Thomas M. Hardiman. James v. Global Tel*Link Corp. 852 F.3d 262 (3d Cir. 2017). The Circuit agreed with Judge Martini that because the plaintiffs did not receive the defendants' terms of use or were informed that use of the defendants' services constituted assent to the terms, the plaintiffs were not bound by them or the arbitration clause they contained. 

While the appeal was pending, the case lay mostly dormant in the district court. The litigation continued to move slowly until the plaintiffs moved for class certification on their New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and § 1983 Fifth Amendment Takings Clause claims on February 27, 2018. On August 6, 2018, Judge Martini granted that motion and certified a class consisting of all people incarcerated in New Jersey prisons or correctional institutions who used a phone system provided by the defendants and people who received calls from a person incarcerated in New Jersey or established an advance pay account to receive calls from such a person from 2006 to June 2011 (with the exception of people calling from or to Essex County).

On March 27, 2018 the defendants moved for summary judgment and on May 4, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion on their § 1983 Takings claim. Judge Martini denied both motions on August 6 in a separate opinion from the one addressing the class certification question.The court rejected several of the defendants' legal claims, including the assertion that they were not state actors amenable to suit under § 1983 and finding issues of material fact for others. 

On April 2, 2018, Judge Martini referred the case to mediation and took the step of scheduling a settlement conference on December 10, 2019. However, the parties were unable to reach an agreement and the case was scheduled for trial in March of 2020.

On January 24, 2020, the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings and to decertify the plaintiffs' class. Judge Martini granted the defendants' motion and dismissed plaintiffs' Fifth Amendments Takings claims on March 2, 2020. He found that denying the plaintiffs reasonably priced calling options did not amount to a taking as it lacked legal compulsion. The court did not resolve the decertification motion.

This case was scheduled to go to trial on March 16, 2020. However, in a March 3 settlement conference the parties reached an agreement on the broad terms of a settlement and the trial was canceled. After more negotiation, the plaintiffs moved for preliminary approval of a proposed settlement on May 28, 2020, which Judge Martini granted on July 15, 2020.

The settlement provided that the defendants would pay $25 million to a settlement fund. That money would be distributed to members of the plaintiffs' class based on the amount each member spent on the defendants' services, with a maximum recovery of $5,000 per account. While the class certified by the court included people who used the defendants' services in New Jersey after 2006, the settlement only allowed for payment to class members who used the defendants' services from 2006 to 2016. The settlement also allowed the plaintiffs to apply for a maximum of $8,332,500 in attorneys' fees. It also provided that class members who were still incarcerated in New Jersey would receive their payments in the form of credits on the phone accounts without filing a proof of claim. However, the settlement did not enjoin the defendants from continuing to engage in unfair business practices, as the plaintiffs had requested in their complaint.

After the proposed settlement was filed, on September 21, 2020, several plaintiffs from a separate class action against the defendants in the Northern District of Georgia moved to intervene in this case. The plaintiffs in the Georgia case also challenged some of the defendants' business practices, but on behalf of a putative class of individuals across the country who used the defendants' services. On October 22, 2020, Judge Martini denied this motion, finding that the Georgia plaintiffs did not have a sufficient direct interest in this case to intervene, but allowing them to appear as amicus curiae at the fairness hearing.

That hearing happened on October 15, 2020 and a week on October 22, 2020 later Judge Martini issued an opinion approving the settlement. He found that the settlement met all the relevant tests for approval and that he could not address the Georgia plaintiffs' concerns about the settlement, as their class had not yet been certified.

The case was closed the day of the order approving the settlement, though the settlement provides that the court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement and its enforcement. The is case ongoing as of November 2020 for settlement enforcement purposes.

May 25, 2007) (“[C]ourts must balance the advantages of applying the primary jurisdiction doctrine against the potential costs resulting from complications and delay in the administrative proceedings.”). K.\nA. Site Commissions\nOne essential term of the DOC and county contracts was that GTL pay the government site commissions (“commissions”), defined by the RFP as “a straight percentage of all originating, billable revenue.” Most notably, GTL charged a 19% fee4 each time a non-inmate set up or deposited funds into a GTL Advance Pay account.5\nC. Excessive Calling Rates and Ancillary Fees\nPlaintiffs argue that ICS charges and fees were many times greater than the costs to GTL of providing ICS. 5 An Advance Pay account is simply a prepaid account set up by a non-inmate (usually a family member) allowing the inmate to use funds to call a particular number or set of numbers.\n3\n\n\x0cCase 2:13-cv-04989-WJM-MF Document 179 Filed 08/06/18 Page 4 of 16 PageID: 4749\nrevenue for the government and GTL by imposing excessive charges and fees on inmates and their loved ones. GTL now charges roughly 5 cents per minute for all calls. In re Hydrogen Peroxide Antitrust Litig., Id.\nThe Court finds that the named representatives assert claims that are typical of the class as a whole. See Byrd v. Aaron’s, Inc., 784 F.3d 154, 163 (3d Cir. E. New Jersey law classifies GTL as an “alternative operator service” (“AOS”),2 subject to regulation by the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (“BPU” or “the Board”). Indeed, evidence in the record suggests that costs to GTL had already decreased significantly by the beginning of the class period in 2006. I needed to be able to speak with my children, my sons, my brother, and my husband. See, e.g., Leon v. Rite Aid Corp., 774 A.2d 674, 678 (N.J. Super. 596 F. App’x at 157-58.\n12\n\n\x0cCase 2:13-cv-04989-WJM-MF Document 181 Filed 08/06/18 Page 13 of 16 PageID: 4775\nGTL incorrectly assumed that the CFA requires deception, its papers failed to adequately address Plaintiffs’ argument that rates and fees are grossly excessive in relation to GTL’s costs. See id. Accordingly, Sperry Corp. is also unhelpful to Plaintiffs on this point.2\nFinally, in Webb’s Fabulous Pharmacies, Inc. v. Beckwith, which Plaintiffs cite elsewhere in their brief, creditors challenged the government’s practice of (1) charging a percentage fee on court-managed “interpleader fund” accounts while also (2) retaining the interest the account accrued. .\nFilarsky v. Delia, 566 U.S. 377, 393 (2012) (quoting Richardson, 521 U.S. at 413).\nPrecisely the same circumstances are present here. See id. (finding there was “nothing unconscionable” about failing to respond to a letter when no obligation to do so existed, without mentioning potential deception).\nFor the foregoing reasons, GTL’s motion to dismiss Plaintiffs’ CFA claims is DENIED.\nC. Site Commissions as Costs\nGTL argues that Plaintiffs’ theory of liability under both the Takings Clause and the CFA fail because they rely on the premise that site commissions are not costs of providing ICS. Settlement §§ 1(u) (defining “Released Claims”), 16 (governing the release of claims).\nOn July 15, 2020, this Court preliminarily approved the Settlement, ECF No. 2 at 12-14; and (2) on June 8, 2020, eleven days after the terms of the Settlement were made publicly available on this Court’s docket, sent a second letter to GTL, copying Plaintiffs, requesting that GTL enter into a stipulation waiving any arguments that the Settlement would preclude certain claims which may be subsequently litigated in the Githieya Action or, in the alternative, provide additional information related to the Settlement of this case and the potential overlap between members of the James Class and Putative Githieya Class, id. at 2-6. Indeed, the precise scope of this case has been the subject of numerous pleadings, hearings, and testimony in the Githieya Action, and the district court in that case has expressed her own concerns about the relationship between this case and the Githieya Action.\n\nIn addition, the Court has its own concerns about the conduct and positions of the parties, and, in deciding whether to finally approve the Settlement as fair, adequate, and reasonable, must act as a fiduciary for absent class members. In short, the Court will not second guess Class Counsel’s evaluation of the claims against GTL or their litigation strategies in determining which claims to pursue or settle, and because Class Members were adequately notified of the consequences of the Settlement and the release, the Court concludes that the release is fair, reasonable, and adequate.\nNotwithstanding the above determination, however, the Court wishes to be clear on what it is not holding. Surveying the landscape of “browsewrap” cases, the Ninth Circuit noted that “courts have been more amenable to enforcing browsewrap agreements” “where the website contains an explicit textual notice that continued use will act as a manifestation of the user’s intent to be bound” by the terms of use. Nguyen v. Barnes & Noble Inc., 763 F.3d 1171, 1177 (9th Cir. Restatement (Second) of Contracts § 19 (1981). 10-CV-6141, 2012 WL 6005384, at *4 (D.N.J. Nov. 30, 2012). If “prejudice is the touchstone for determining whether the right to arbitrate has been waived by litigation conduct,” Ehleiter, 482 F.3d at 222, the Court does not find that the Plaintiffs have been prejudiced to such an extent that a finding of waiver is appropriate here.\nD. Stay as to the Remaining Plaintiffs\nLastly, the Court denies GTL’s request to stay this proceeding in regards to Plaintiffs Mark Skladany and John F. Crow. All other proceedings in this Action against Defendants (except as permitted in the Settlement Agreement) shall be stayed pending the Fairness Hearing.",0.5017,0.4486,0.4737,0.1164,0.1041,0.1099,0.1473,0.1317,0.139
CJ-NY-0013,"On January 8, 2016, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover property seized by the NYPD after an arrest. The case was assigned to Judge Denise L. Cote. The individual plaintiff was arrested in November 2014, and his iPhone and $1,399 in wages were seized by police. In his criminal case, which was dismissed in May 2015, he was represented by the Bronx Defenders, who are the second plaintiff to this lawsuit. The Bronx Defenders, a non-profit organization that provides criminal defense and civil legal services to law-income people in the Bronx, also assists hundreds of clients every year who are attempting to retrieve property seized pursuant to an arrest. Together they brought this lawsuit against the City of New York under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the city violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory damages for the individual plaintiff for the monies seized from him at his arrest, the replacement costs for his iPhone, and all applicable interest. 

According to the complaint, after a person is arrested, the NYPD routinely seized his or her personal property and recorded it in a computerized invoice system that tracked and categorized it. Once the criminal case against that individual was terminated, and the time to appeal had lapsed, the U.S. Constitution mandated that the government demonstrate a new legal basis to retain the property. But in practice, the NYPD often retained property and refused to release it until claimants obtained a ""DA Release,"" even where all charges had been dismissed and sealed. In the Bronx, the District Attorney's Office frequently failed to respond to requests for DA Releases, and the City did not provide an alternate recourse or assistance. The plaintiffs here alleged in the complaint that they tried numerous times - via voicemails, letters, and in-person requests - to obtain the property seized by the NYPD with no success. They subsequently filed this complaint against the city. The proposed class would consist of ""all individuals who have been or will be unable to secure the release from the NYPD Property Clerk of Personal Property seized in connection with an arrest where (i) the individual named on the voucher for the property can no longer be tried on any charge that was the original basis for the arrest, and (ii) the City has made no showing of any continued basis to retain the property.""

On May 17, 2016, Judge Cote signed an order referring this case to a magistrate judge for settlement, and the settlement discussions were to take place in June. However, on June 3, 2016, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, which added two additional individual plaintiffs who experienced similar property loss by the NYPD and provided more facts as to the NYPD's process of returning property seized after an arrest. Five days later, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.

On July 25, 2016, the parties agreed to stay all proceedings through February 28, 2017 to work toward a possible settlement. Accordingly, on the same day, Judge Cote ordered that the plaintiffs' motion for class certification be denied without prejudice to renewal upon the expiration of the six-month stay. On March 1, 2017, the parties agreed to extend the stay, and at the parties’ consent, Judge Cote referred the case to Magistrate Judge James Francis for further settlement discussions. On June 22, 2017, after nearly a year of unsuccessful settlement negotiations, the court lifted the stay, and litigation continued.

Despite this, the parties did eventually reach a settlement agreement on February 9, 2018. The court ordered the settlement agreement into effect three days later. This settlement agreement required the city to pay the plaintiffs a total of $10,000 in damages and create a committee to assess its compliance over the two years that the agreement would be in effect. The Bronx DA was also required to reform its policies to make it easier for arrestees to recover their seized property in a timely fashion. The parties agreed to resolve their dispute over attorneys’ fees at a later date.

On August 15, 2018, the parties agreed that defendants would pay $675,000 to cover all costs and attorneys’ fees. 

In an order issued on February 19, 2020, the obligations of the settlement were extended for the City of New York until June 30, 2020. The Bronx DA was released from its settlement obligations on February 12, 2020. As of May 27, 2020, there are no further entries in the docket, and the case is ongoing for enforcement.

It is axiomatic that the government may not seize property without due process of law. Obtaining a DA Release is no easy task, especially because after a case is terminated there is no longer a prosecuting attorney assigned to it. Advocates and attorneys at The Bronx Defenders assist hundreds of clients\n2\n\n\x0cCase 1:16-cv-00156-DLC Document 1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 3 of 13\nevery year who are attempting to retrieve property seized pursuant to an arrest. BXD is duly incorporated in New York State and has its principal place of business in New York City. The City’s policy concerning the return of property seized pursuant to an arrest is set forth in the Rules of the City of New York (“RCNY”). On July 6, 2015, Mr. Encarnacion, through his counsel The Bronx Defenders, made another demand on the NYPD for return of his Property via certified mail.\n37. The request was denied because, the Property Clerk stated, they did not have a DA Release.\n41. As a result of the NYPD’s refusal to return his Property, Mr. Encarnacion has suffered and continues to suffer the loss of his Cash and Phone. The Bronx Defenders must expend considerable resources trying to extract property from the NYPD as a result of the City’s unlawful policy and practice of requiring a DA Release to retrieve property after a case is closed.\n9\n\n\x0cCase 1:16-cv-00156-DLC Document 1 Filed 01/08/16 Page 10 of 13\nFIRST CLAIM FOR RELIEF Violation of Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment\n(All Plaintiffs against the City) 49.

Mr. Encarnacion hereby realleges and incorporates by reference paragraphs 1 through 56, above. In short, current NYPD policy and practice places an unconstitutional burden on property claimants seeking to retrieve their belongings. Every year the NYPD effectuates over three hundred thousand arrests. In the Bronx, there is no formal system to record a claimant’s demand for a DA Release. If the property owner is unable to secure a DA Release within 270 days of submitting a request to the NYPD Property Clerk for the return of Arrest Evidence after the termination of a criminal case, the City’s regulations maintain that the NYPD “may dispose of the property according to law.” The Bronx Defenders was appointed to represent Mr. Encarnacion. At no time did the City dispute that the case against Mr. Encarnacion had terminated. Nor did he issue a DA Release for either the phone or the cash. Mr. Clavasquin was carrying his Apple iPhone. On December 9, 2015, Mr. Clavasquin brought his certificate of disposition to the NYPD Property Clerk. On April 18, 2016, Mr. Clavasquin, through his counsel, submitted a written demand for the property to the NYPD Property Clerk and a written demand for a DA Release to the Bronx District Attorney’s Office, both by certified mail.\n13\n\n\x0cCase 1:16-cv-00156-DLC Document 31 Filed 06/03/16 Page 14 of 19\n71. At no time did the City proffer that the District Attorney or the City had any basis to continue to retain Mr. Clavasquin’s property after his case was terminated.\n73. In fact, the Bronx Division of the NYPD Property Clerk regularly refers property owners to The Bronx Defenders for assistance when it has refused to return their property. See McClendon v. Rosetti, 460 F.2d 111 (2d Cir. Although some property is designated as “Safekeeping” and returned to the owner upon demand, the NYPD broadly exercises its discretion to hold noncontraband property as Arrest Evidence where it perceives any “relation to the matter for which the person has been arrested.” 38 RCNY § 12-34(d).\nIn sum, as contemplated by the City’s rules, a claimant seeking the return of Personal Property after a criminal case is over is entitled to have the NYPD Property Clerk release the property or be informed of the grounds why such property is being withheld so the property owner can appeal the decision.\n2 These regulations were promulgated in an attempt to comply with the final order in McClendon v. Rosetti, 460 F.2d 111 (2d Cir. It can take weeks or even months for a prosecutor to respond, even when a formal demand has been issued. ( As a consequence, the City routinely deprives claimants of their Personal Property even when the original basis for holding the property is no longer conceivably relevant and no new showing has been offered for why retention of the property is justified. ( Victor Encarnacion was arrested in November 2014, and his phone was taken as Arrest Evidence. ( 9; Declaration of Mariana Kovel, June 7, 2016 (“Kovel Decl.”), See Kelen v.

PB-MA-0011,"On May 17, 2007, Medicaid-eligible individuals with acquired brain injuries qualifying for long-term care services in nursing or rehabilitation facilities and the Brain Injury Association of Massachusetts filed this class-action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, on behalf of themselves and others similarly situated. The plaintiffs sued Massachusetts under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12132 <i>et seq.</i>), Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794(a)), and the Social Security Act (42 U.S.C. § 1396a(a)(8), (a)(10)(A)). Represented by the Center for Public Representation and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought to enjoin Massachusetts to comply with the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and Social Security Act by offering services and programs for individuals with acquired brain injuries in integrated community settings.

Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that Massachusetts had illegally discriminated against them on the basis of disability. They cited the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=11643><i>Olmstead v. L.C.</i>, 527 U.S. 581 (1999)</a>, which held that the ADA forbids the unnecessary institutionalization of individuals with disabilities, and mandates that their rehabilitative and medical needs be provided in a manner that enables individuals with disabilities to be independent and integrated members of the community. The plaintiffs alleged that at least a quarter of the more than 8,000 individuals with traumatic brain injuries living in nursing homes or rehabilitation facilities in Massachusetts would be able to and would prefer to reside in an integrated community setting, provided they received appropriate aids and support. The plaintiffs alleged that in the absence of these services, they were unlawfully denied their personal liberty, freedom of association, and meaningful access to community life.

On September 26, 2007, the court certified the class.

On May 30, 2008, the parties entered a court-approved settlement agreement. Under the settlement, Massachusetts agreed that within six months of the effective date of the settlement it would issue a proposal to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to establish a Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) (§1915(c) of the Social Security Act) waiver program that would enable individuals with traumatic brain injuries the option of a community-placed living situation. Initially this program would offer 300 such waivers.  Individuals receiving the waivers would participate in developing their own Individualized Service Plan with an interdisciplinary team and would receive services appropriate to their level of need. Waiver recipients would have the option of living with family, where applicable, or of living in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, e.g., their own apartment or home, or in a group home.

Massachusetts reserved the right to deny waivers to any person whose annual costs of care to Medicaid from residential habilitation and other waiver services, plus Title XIX state plan services, would exceed $164,131, and also to deny waivers to any person whose annual Medicaid waiver costs, exclusive of Title XIX and residential costs, would likely exceed $87,919.  The settlement limited the total cost of the waiver program, inclusive of all Medicaid and state-funded expenditures for the participants, to $15,000,000. In order to stay within this cap, the state reserved the right to take corrective actions, such as reducing the number of waivers available. Massachusetts also agreed to implement an education and outreach program in order to educate individuals with acquired traumatic brain injuries about the program.

On June 2, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking reasonable attorneys' fees and costs under the fee shifting provisions of the ADA, which allow a ""prevailing party"" plaintiff to recover expenses from a defendant. 42 U.S.C. § 12205. Massachusetts objected, arguing that the court-approved class action settlement, which expressly was not a court-ordered consent decree, was insufficient to establish the plaintiffs as the prevailing party. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion, ordering the State to pay $750,000 in attorneys' fees. 683 F. Supp. 2d 121. Massachusetts appealed. On February 17, 2011, the First Circuit Court of Appeals (Selya, J.) affirmed the lower court’s decision. 636 F.3d 1. 

On June 19, 2013, the parties agreed to a new settlement agreement that would replace the original agreement, which the state was unable to fully implement because it could not secure federal grant funding for community-based services, leaving thousands of individuals with brain injuries languishing in facilities across the state.  Under the Amended Agreement, the state would use another federal grant project, the Money Follows the Person (MFP) Demonstration, as well as other waiver programs, to provide residential and non-residential supports for up to 1,174 Medicaid-eligible people with brain injuries who were in long-term rehabilitation facilities and nursing homes.  

On July 11, 2013, the district court (Judge Michael A. Ponsor) issued final approval of the amended settlement agreement. The court retained jurisdiction over the case. The agreement was to last for six years.  

On June 27, 2014, Judge Ponsor revised a Protective Order originally granted on August 27, 2007, adjusting and broadening the scope of protected health information (PHI) for class members and their guardians.

No substantive docket entries were made during the remainder of the six-year term, which ended on July 1, 2019, so the case is presumably now closed. ","[',;i UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n\' ~ ,\n\nDISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETT&"", I . Like persons without disabilities, these individuals need ""family relations, social contacts, work options, economic, independence, educational advancement and cultural enrichment."" These\n2\n\n\x0cindividuals are entitled to receive services in the most integrated setting appropriate for their needs and should not continue to suffer the isolation and indignity of institutional care because of the defendants\' ineffective reliance on institutions like nursing and other long term care facilities.\n5. Despite knowledge of these recommendations, of the professional consensus about the benefits of community living, of the cost-effectiveness of non-institutional alternatives, and of the mandates of rederallaw, the defendants have not made reasonable efforts to develop collllllunity alternatives to institutional confinement for persons with brain injuries.\n6. Instead, the number of persons with brain injuries who remain needlessly institutionalized in nursing and rehabilitation facilities in Massachusetts has increased over the past decade. Half of the individual plaintiffs reside in western Massachusetts. Although Ms. Hutchinson is unable to speak, she can effectively communicate her thoughts and wishes. She has re-Iearned many basic skins since her injury, including how to swallow on her own and how to use a straw for drinking.\n17. ; Ms. Hutchinson has been a resident of the nursing facility for more than nine years. This acquired brain injury primarily impacted the left side of his body, affecting his speech, mobility, facial muscles and hand.\n30 Despite significant progress in the early phase of his rehabilitation, Mr. Wilson still suffers from chronic and debilitating pain in the left side. Thomas Denher, Acting Director of MassHealth and the Office of Medicaid, is responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Massachusetts Medicaid program. If they are caused by external events, like falls, auto accidents or other head wounds, they are part of a subset of acquired brain injuries called traumatic brain injuries (TBI). The ADA\'s purpose and goal is ""the elimination of discrimination against individuals with disabilities."" Opportunities to be outdoors or to participate in life outside the facility are limited or non-existent, except to the extent that family members can provide these opportunities for integration.\n76. Because they are usually large, segregated, and isolated from the rest of society, nursing and rehabilitation facilities inhibit meaningful community involvement by depriving residents of the opportunity to interact with non-disabled people in non-custodial relationships in the community. Title II of the ADA requires that ""a public entity shall administer services, programs and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of qualified individuals with disabilities."" 2003); Truesdell v. Philadelphia Housing Authority, 290 F.3d 159, 165 (3rd Cir. For example, in the D.C. Circuit and the Third Circuit, a party “prevails” when the court issues an order that (1) contains mandatory language, (2) is entitled an “order,” and (3) bears the district judge\'s signature, not\n7\n\n\x0cCase 3:07-cv-30084-MAP Document 73 Filed 02/08/10 Page 8 of 20\nthose of the parties\' counsel. In the event of noncompliance, Defendants argued, the court might in its discretion order specific performance, and this is essentially a contractual remedy, insufficient under Aranov.\nDefendants’ argument mischaracterizes the court’s authority under the Agreement. If the Commonwealth is unable to obtain funding or approvals and the Agreement stalls, either side may move to vacate the settlement so that the plaintiffs can litigate the case.\nThe Agreement contemplates that the case will remain open for a period of years while the Commonwealth performs thereunder; it authorizes dismissal of the action only after the Commonwealth has completed certain specified obligations and is found to be in ""substantial compliance"" with the Agreement\'s terms. 2004).\n2 In any event, the key precedent is Buckhannon, and the Court there dealt in part, as we do here, with the ADA\'s fee-shifting provision, 42 U.S.C. § 12205. Smyth v. Rivero, 282 F.3d 268, 279 (4th Cir. As a fallback, the Commonwealth challenges the size of the fee award. We do not agree.\nThe Commonwealth\'s principal lament relates to staffing. Gay Officers Action League, 247 F.3d at 298.\nWe focus first on the plaintiffs\' enlistment of a number of different lawyers, many of whom worked collectively on specific projects within the broader litigation. Another rule of thumb is that data evidencing the prevailing market rate for counsel of comparable skill and experience provides helpful guidance. He has also learned to shower on his own Witll cues. He wants to live as independently as possible in the community. In addition to its organizational interest in expanding connnunity settings and supports, BIAMA has many members who are also members of the plaintiff class and who are directly harmed by the actions and inactions of the defendants.\n12\n\n\x0cCase 3:07-cv-30084-MAP Document 7 Filed 06/18/07 Page 13 of 20\n45. He is sued in his official capacity.\n56. 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(2)(C); 42 C.F.R. § 441.302(d).\n76. As a result, there have been few persons with brain injuries who have been able to leave nursing and rehabilitation facilities over the past decade. Regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide that ""a public entity may not, directly or through contractual or other arrangements, utilize criteria or other methods of administration: (i) that have the effect of subjecting qualified individuals with disabilities to discrimination on the basis of disability; [01\'1 (ii) that have the purpose or effect of defeating or substantially impairing accomplishment of the 0 bj ectives of the entity\'s program with respect to individuals with disabilities ...."" 28 C.P.R. § 3S.130(b)(3). The community services provided in the ABI Waiver program will include all of the community residential and nonresidential services currently provided in the Traumatic Brain Injury Waiver operated by the Massachusetts Rehabilitation Cmmnission (MRC), except that residential habilitation shall be limited to no more than 100 Waiver participants with an acquired brain injury at any point in time.\n4. Not later than nine months after CMS approval of the ABI Waiver, the defendants will begin to select eligible persons with an acquired brain injury for participation in the ABI Waiver, subject to the cost neutrality limit of~ 8 above.\nc. For the ABI Waiver that covers services other than residential habilitation services, eligible persons with a11 acquired brain injury as defined in footnote 1 above will pmiicipate in the ABI Waiver, according to the following schedule:\n6\n\n\x0cCase 3:07-cv-30084-MAP Document 42-2 Filed 06/02/08 Page 8 of 23\na. Assuming that CMS approves that proposal, the defendants will take reasonable actions to implement the Community First Demonstration Project proposal as approved by CMS, including the provisions relating to the ""Imminent Risk Group,"" subject to the limits of the Demonstration Project as approved.\n20. The plaintiffs through counsel will have an opportunity to review and cmun1ent on these policies and procedures before they are finalized.\n26. For persons with an acquired brain injury in nursing facilities who are preparing to transition to the community tlu·ough participation in the ABI Waiver and/or the Community First Demonstration Project, the defendants will make payments to therapists in accordance with duly promulgated regulations set forth at 130 CMR 432 and 130 CMR 450 for ongoing therapy services.

EE-MO-0002,"On Oct. 7, 2004, the St. Louis District office of the EEOC brought this suit against Allstate Insurance Company, a major insurance provider, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The complaint alleged that Allstate's rehire policy disproportionately and adversely impacted workers over the age of 40, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC also brought a disparate treatment claim, alleging that Allstate refused to rehire certain former employees because of their age. The EEOC sought to permanently enjoin Allstate from discriminating on the basis age against individuals 40 years of age and older. The EEOC also wanted the court to order that Allstate implement policies, practices, and programs providing equal employment opportunities for individuals 40 years of age and older. Finally, the EEOC sought back wages and liquidated damages for adversely affected employees. 

In 1999, Allstate implemented a Reorganization Plan, which eliminated all employee-agent positions and terminated the employment contracts of its employee-agents. In connection with the Reorganization Plan, Allstate implemented a rehire moratorium policy in 2000. Under the policy, former employee-agents who were subject to the Reorganization Plan were ineligible for rehire in non-agent positions for a period of one year after their termination, or after all severance benefits had been received. The EEOC alleged that the rehire moratorium policy had disparate impact on former employee-agents who were members of the protected age group and that Allstate engaged in disparate treatment of such members of the protected age group.

Both sides filed motions for partial summary judgment in June 2006, and in October 2006 District Judge E. Richard Webber denied Allstate's motion but granted in part the EEOC's motion. The court held that although no material issue of fact existed as to the EEOC's prima face case of disparate impact, Allstate had provided sufficient evidence that the challenged employment policy was adopted based on reasonable factors other than age. Since the EEOC had the ultimate burden of showing that Allstate's reasons for the policy were unreasonable, and had provided sufficient evidence of unreasonableness, the court held that question was not appropriate for summary judgment. 458 F. Supp. 2d 980 (E.D. Mo. 2006).   

In Jan. 2007, Allstate was given leave in the district court to file an interlocutory appeal, at which point the case was stayed pending the result of that appeal. No. 4:04CV01359 ERW, 2007 WL 38675 (E.D. Mo. Jan. 4, 2007). Allstate appealed on two questions of law: (1) whether Allstate’s rehire policy is an “employment policy”
which can be challenged under a disparate impact theory of discrimination; and (2)
whether the statistics proffered by the EEOC and adopted by the district court
establish disparate impact as a matter of law. On June 10, 2008, Eighth Circuit Judge Myron H. Bright answered both questions in the affirmative, holding that Allstate's rehire policy could be challenged under ADEA and that the EEOC's statistical evidence established a prima facie case that the rehire policy had a disparate impact. 528 F.3d 1042 (8th Cir. 2008). 

However, on September 8, 2008, the Eighth Circuit granted Allstate's Petition for Rehearing En Banc and vacated the June 10, 2008 judgment. That same day, the Eighth Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and the case went back to district court. 

After proceedings resumed in the district court, there was additional discovery. On Sept. 11, 2009, the parties filed a joint motion to approve the parties' proposed Stipulated Order resolving all claims in this action. On Sept. 14, 2009, District Judge Webber issued a Stipulated Order containing the terms of the parties' settlement agreement. 

With respect to injunctive relief, Allstate agreed that before adopting any new policy limiting the re-employment of former employees whose employment was terminated involuntarily as part of a reorganization or reduction-in-force, it will determine whether such a policy disproportionately affects individuals who are age 40 and above. If the policy does disproportionately impact those 40 or older, Allstate agreed to refrain from implementing the policy until it gives the EEOC 14 days written notice of its implementation, provides a list of reasons for the policy, and gives reasonable opportunity to meet and discuss with the EEOC. Additionally, Allstate agreed that any new policy would comply with the requirements of the ADEA. However, there was no admission of liability by Allstate.

With respect to monetary damages, Allstate agreed to pay a total of $4.5 million to individuals affected by the rehire policy. The settlement agreement required that the EEOC provide notice to all eligible claimants, giving them a chance to comment on or object to the methodology for allocating the $4.5 million settlement fund. The agreement specified that the court would retain jurisdiction over the case for three years.

Following the notice and comment period, Judge Webber issued a Settlement Allocation Order on Dec. 15, 2009. The Settlement Allocation Order approved of the proposed Distribution Plan, stating that it was a fair and reasonable allocation of the monetary relief provided under the Stipulated Order, and rejected all of the claimants' objections.

On Jan. 14, 2010, Judge Webber finalized the settlement. The three year period of the court's jurisdiction passed without further litigation, and the case is now closed.

Substantial Grounds for Difference of Opinion The Defendant spent a great deal of time, both in its brief and in oral arguments, arguing why this Court’s prior decision was incorrect. That the Defendant disagreed with a ruling adverse to its interest is unremarkable. STANDING\nAlthough neither party has raised the question, this Court is obligated to examine whether the Plaintiff had standing, within the meaning of Article III of the United States Constitution. The Plaintiff, the EEOC, represents a group of former employees that allege an injury as a result of the Defendant’s “rehire policy;” that\n4\n\n\x0cthey were barred from obtaining an alternate position within Allstate. Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247-48 (1986). City of Mt. Pleasant, Iowa v. Associated Elec. Olson v. Pennzoil Co., 943 F.2d 881, 883 (8th Cir. See e.g. Leftwich v. HarrisStowe State College, 702 F.3d 686, 690 (8th Cir. 2006) (“The best reading of the text of the ADEA-in light of City of Jackson and Wards Cove-is that the plaintiff bears the burden of persuading the factfinder that the employer’s justification is unreasonable.”); 2006) (The court found it error to instruct the jury that the RFOA requirement was an affirmative defense.).\n11\n\n\x0cThe difficulty in deciding under which section this case arises is emphasized by the parties’ suggested methods of identifying a statistically significant disparate impact. The concerns of Congress, that employment actions\nwhich have the affect of leaving older workers in a disadvantaged position of seeking\nemployment, are the same concerns that are raised by the present case. Id. Only once the Plaintiffs were members of the general applicant pool did the policy effect them, unlike the present case where the rehire policy immediately effected all former employee-agents. A second reason was to encourage former employee-agents to participate in the independent contractor agency program. Id. at 15.\nFinally, the district court ruled the rehire policy resulted in “the termination and subsequent refusal to hire over 6,000 employees,” and therefore should be “appropriately addressed under § 623(a)(2)” as an employment policy which deprived employees of employment opportunities with Allstate.\nWe agree with the district court that Allstate’s rehire policy falls within the meaning of § 623(a)(2) as an employment policy. Such a policy, we hold, deprived Allstate’s employee-agents of employment opportunities with Allstate.\nWe therefore hold that the EEOC may challenge the rehire policy under § 623(a)(2) on a disparate-impact theory.\n7However, the rehire policy was not implemented until September 2000, three months after Allstate terminated its employee-agents and three months after the June deadline for the employee-agents to decide whether to become independent contractors. If this were a hiring case covered under § 623(a)(1), Allstate’s approach, relying on Wards Cove Packing Co., 490 U.S. 642,\n-12-\n\n\x0cCase: 4:04-cv-01359-ERW Doc. #: Id. The plaintiff brought suit alleging the policy, which reserved a certain number of positions at the new college for nontenured faculty had a disparate-impact on older teachers. Here, the majority observes that Allstate had terminated all employeeagents as of June 30, 2000; that Allstate did not have a policy that restricted the rehire of its former employee-agents between June 2000 and September 2000; and that, during that three-month period, Allstate hired three former employee agents into nonagent positions.

IM-IL-0024,"This case is one of several brought nationwide by States, counties, and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration's revised, final public charge rule, which expands the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. In the fall of 2019, district court judges from across the country granted preliminary injunctions enjoining the government from implementing the public charge rule. But after multiple Circuit Courts and the Supreme Court issued stays of these injunctions, the public charge rule was implemented by the government on February 24, 2020. The District Court in this case issued a judgment vacating the public charge rule. The Seventh Circuit stayed the order pending appeal and petition for certiorari. In addition, on February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule. A little over a month later on March 9, 2021, DHS officially abandoned the rule and the petitions for certiorari were voluntarily dismissed by the government.

<u>Cook County Sues Over the Public Charge Rule</u>
On September 23, 2019, Cook County, Illinois, and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, Inc., represented by private counsel, filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its acting secretary in his official capacity, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its acting secretary in his official capacity, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs sought relief to declare the Department of Homeland Security’s Final Rule (""the Rule"") unlawful and invalid due to violations of the APA and unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause. The plaintiffs also sought to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Rule from being enforced in the state of Illinois.

On August 14, 2019, the DHS published a <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-17142/inadmissibility-on-public-charge-grounds"">revised, final public charge rule</a>, which defines personal circumstances that affect the ability of individuals and their families to successfully enter the U.S. or acquire legal permanent resident status (i.e., get a green card). The final rule increases the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that if an immigration officer finds that a person seeking a visa is likely to become a public charge, that person is “inadmissible.” Thus, an immigrant who uses non-cash benefits such as food stamps or Medicaid may be found more likely to be a public charge and inadmissible for purposes of a visa or green card application. The plaintiffs asserted that the effect of this Rule would be to force immigrant families to choose between using these benefits or risk failing to gain permanent resident status.

The plaintiffs contended that the defendants violated the APA in exceeding their statutory authority by redefining the term ""public charge"" and contravened existing law by considering public benefits that have been explicitly and repeatedly excluded from public charge determinations. Furthermore, the plaintiffs claimed that that Rule was arbitrary and capricious because defendants failed to justify their departure from settled practice, failed to adequately consider the Rule's varied and extensive harms, and because the Rule's complex rules will lead to arbitrary enforcement. The plaintiffs also argued that the Rule violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by discriminating against people with disabilities and that the Rule violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 

Additionally, the plaintiffs asserted that the Rule would have a chilling effect on immigrant communities, ""causing individuals to forgo critical public benefits—an impact that will cause devastating, irreparable harm to children, families, and public health in Cook County and throughout Illinois."" The plaintiffs argued that immigrant families will disenroll in federal health and assistance programs, leading to adverse health, economic, and productivity results, and placing a heavy burden and strain on County agencies and programs. 

<u>The Plaintiffs Seek a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction</u>
On September 25, 2019, after originally being assigned to Judge John Robert Blakey, the case was reassigned to Judge Gary Feinerman. On the same day, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction (PI) or stay. With the Rule set to go in effect on October 15, 2019, the plaintiffs sought immediate injunctive relief or a stay enjoining the defendants from implementing the Rule. The plaintiffs claimed that they were likely to succeed on their claim under the APA, that they would suffer irreparable harm absent immediate injunctive relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed strongly in favor of an immediate injunction or stay to maintain the status quo.

On October 8, 2019, the defendants filed an opposition to the plaintiffs' emergency motion. The defendants argued that the court should deny the motion because the plaintiffs were a governmental entity and a group of organizations serving immigrants, rather than persons actually affected by the rule, and thus cannot meet jurisdictional requirements. The defendants also asserted that the plaintiffs' claims were meritless, that ""the Rule accords with the longstanding meaning of 'public charge' and complies with the APA"" and that plaintiffs' ""disagreements are ultimately with the wisdom of the policy, a judgment allocated to the political branches.""

A few days later the defendants filed a supplemental memorandum in opposition to the plaintiffs' emergency motion. On October 11, orders by the United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York and Eastern District of Washington preliminarily enjoined the defendants from implementing the Rule nationwide, including Illinois. The defendants asserted that the plaintiffs could no longer claim that they will suffer irreparable harm absent a PI and thus a PI at this time is inappropriate. 

<u>District Court Grants a Preliminary Injunction</u>
Notwithstanding these nationwide PIs, on October 14, 2019, Judge Feinerman granted the plaintiffs' motion and enjoined the defendants from implementing the Rule in the State of Illinois. Judge Feinerman concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the Rule conflicts with the Supreme Court’s formulation of public charge, in violation of the APA. Judge Feinerman further concluded that the plaintiffs have demonstrated irreparable harm in the absence of a PI and that the balance of harms favors the plaintiffs. 417 F.Supp.3d 1008.

Soon after, on October 25, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to stay the PI pending appeal. The defendants argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal and that they would suffer irreparable harm absent a stay from being compelled to grant lawful permanent residence to persons who would likely become a public charge under the Rule. The defendants appealed the PI to the Seventh Circuit on October 30, 2019. Judge Feinerman denied the defendants' motion on November 14, 2019.

On December 23, 2019, a Seventh Circuit panel denied the defendants' motion to stay the PI pending appeal. The Seventh Circuit's decision was in contrast to a Ninth Circuit order staying a nationwide PI, which also enjoined the implementation of the Rule, pending appeal. 

<u>Defendants' Motion to Dismiss</u>
Back in the district court, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on January 16, 2020. The defendants argued that in light of a Ninth Circuit opinion concluding that the Rule falls within the defendants' discretion to interpret and implement the meaning of public charge and that the Supreme Court has not set a fixed definition of public charge, the plaintiffs' complaint should be dismissed. Plaintiffs, in opposition to the motion, maintained that the Rule ""is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statutory text, and DHS does not, and cannot, offer justification for this transformation of well-settled law"" and will impose significant costs on the plaintiffs. 

<u>The Supreme Court Stays All Nationwide Injunctions Enjoining Implementation of the Public Charge Rule, but Not Illinois' Injunction</u>
The Supreme Court weighed in to provide clarity to the several, overlapping PIs enjoining the implementation of the Rule that had been issued across the country. On January 27, 2020, ruling in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287"">State of New York v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, Justice Gorsuch stayed the Southern District of New York's nationwide PI regarding the Rule, concluding that the ""routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions."" However, the Supreme Court declined to stay the Northern District of Illinois' PI because it applied only to the state of Illinois. 140 S. Ct. 599.

<u>Defendants Renew Efforts to Seek a Stay of the Injunction</u>
Following the Supreme Court's order to stay the nationwide PI, on January 28, 2020, the defendants filed a renewed motion to the Seventh Circuit to stay the district court's PI. The defendants argued that ""in light of the Supreme Court's decision holding that a stay pending appeal of injunctions against enforcement of this Rule is appropriate,"" the Seventh Circuit should issue a stay pending appeal to allow the Rule to go into effect in Illinois. A Seventh Circuit panel denied the renewed motion for stay on February 10, 2020, without issuing an opinion or explanation for its conclusion. Instead, the Seventh Circuit issued an expedited briefing schedule to ensure prompt consideration of the PI. 

On February 13, 2020, the defendants filed an application to the Supreme Court for a stay pending appeal. The defendants contended that the Seventh Circuit ""stands alone in finding a stay unwarranted;"" the Fourth and Ninth Circuits, along with the Supreme Court in an appeal pending in the Second Circuit, stayed ""materially identical"" PIs. The defendants further asserted that, even though the PI here was distinguishable because it was not nationwide, the Supreme Court indicated in its January 27 order that ""challenges to the Rule will be unsuccessful and that even a more limited injunction would impose irreparable harm on the government."" 

<u>The Supreme Court Stays Illinois' Injunction Pending the Seventh Circuit Ruling and a Writ of Certiorari</u>
On February 21, 2020, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, granted the defendants' application for stay and issued an order staying the district court's PI pending disposition of the appeal in the Seventh Circuit and disposition on defendants' timely petition for a writ of certiorari. The majority did not file an opinion in support of its decision. Justice Sotomayor, dissenting, concluded that ""the Government’s only claimed hardship is that it must enforce an existing interpretation of an immigration rule in one State—just as it has done for the past 20 years—while an updated version of the rule takes effect in the remaining 49,"" which was not enough to satisfy its ""especially heavy burden."" 140 S. Ct. 681.

<u>The District Court Denies Defendants' Motion to Dismiss</u>
On May 19, Judge Feinerman issued a memorandum opinion and order denying defendants' motion to dismiss and concluding that plaintiffs are entitled to discovery on its equal protection claim. First, Judge Feinerman denied defendants' claims that plaintiffs ""lack standing or fall outside the pertinent zone of interests, that this suit is not ripe, or that the APA claims fail as a matter of law,"" as the court already addressed those issues in its preliminary injunction opinion. Moreover, Judge Feinerman found that plaintiffs' equal protection claim survived dismissal, as the allegation ""that the Final Rule’s disproportionate impact on nonwhite immigrants motivated its promulgation is eminently plausible."" Judge Feinerman further concluded that extra-record discovery on plaintiffs' equal protection claim was justified because plaintiffs' made a ""strong showing that the Rule was developed and promulgated 'at least in part because of' a substantial and impermissible reason not reflected in the administrative record—the Rule’s disproportionate 'adverse effects upon' nonwhite immigrants.""

<u>The Seventh Circuit Affirms the Preliminary Injunction</u>
On June 10, a Seventh Circuit panel (Circuit Judges Diane Wood, Ilana Rovner, and Amy Coney Barrett) issued a ruling affirming the preliminary injunction. 962 F.3d 208. Writing for a 2-1 majority, Judge Wood held that (1) the county had standing to sue; (2) DHS's interpretation of the rule fell outside the boundaries set by the statute; and (3) the public charge rule was likely to be arbitrary and capricious.

Judge Barrett dissented, writing that DHS's interpretation of the public charge rule did not fall outside the boundaries set by the statute. She did not comment on the rule being likely to fail the arbitrary and capricious standard, however, because the district court didn't address it and plaintiffs barely briefed it.

The stay remained, however, as defendants still had the chance to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.

<u>Defendants' Appeal is Denied, as is their Petition to Rehear</u>
In response to the ruling on the motion to dismiss, defendants asked the district court to certify for interlocutory appeal the denial of the motion to dismiss on June 10. Defendants argued that dismissal of plaintiffs' equal protection claim would avoid difficult issues of executive privilege arising from plaintiff's extra-record discovery. On July 14, Judge Feinerman declined to certify the order for interlocutory appeal. He found that, even if plaintiffs' equal protection claim were dismissed, plaintiffs would still be entitled to the same discovery from their APA claims.

On July 27, defendants filed a petition for the Seventh Circuit to rehear their appeal of the preliminary injunction <i>en banc</i>. The Seventh Circuit denied their petition on August 12. On October 7, 2020, defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. 

<u>Public Charge Rule is Vacated Following Plaintiffs' Successful Motion for Summary Judgment on APA Claim</u>
On August 31, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the APA claim. Relying on the Seventh Circuit's affirmance of the preliminary injunction, they argued that they should win on the APA claim while the equal protection claim proceeds in court. They further argued that the public charge rule should be vacated as a result. Defendants conceded that plaintiffs were likely to win on the APA claim, but argued that the injunction should only be lifted for the State of Illinois.

On November 2, Judge Feinerman issued an order granting plaintiffs' motion and vacating the public charge rule nationwide. He agreed that the Seventh Circuit had effectively argued the merits of the APA claim, and held vacatur to be an appropriate remedy for a rule that violated the APA.

<u>Order Vacating the Rule is Stayed Pending Appeal and Petition for Certiorari</u>
Immediately after the ruling, defendants moved to stay the district court's vacatur of the public charge rule pending appeal. The Seventh Circuit granted defendants' motion on November 3.

On November 19, the Seventh Circuit further ordered that the appeal of the order would be suspended pending the Supreme Court's resolution of defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari on the preliminary injunction.

<u>The Rule is Officially Abandoned and Vacated</u>
On January 22, 2021, two days after President Biden's inauguration, Judge Feinerman requested a status report from the new defendants addressing whether they plan to pursue their Seventh Circuit appeal or petition for certiorari. The status hearing was originally set for February 8, but was moved to February 26.

On February 2, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule.

On March 9, 2021, <a href=""https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/03/09/dhs-secretary-statement-2019-public-charge-rule"">DHS formally abandoned the rule</a>. The government voluntarily dismissed its appeal to the Seventh Circuit, lifting the stay of the November 2, 2020 decision vacating the Public Charge Final Rule nationwide. That same day, at all parties' requests, the Supreme Court dismissed the pending petition from this case, as well as a similar petition for the Second Circuit (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287""><i>New York v. DHS</i></a>) and the Ninth Circuit (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17409""><i>San Francisco v. USCIS</i></a>).

On March 10, eleven state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, moved to intervene as defendants in the Seventh Circuit. They filed similar motions in the Ninth and Fourth Circuits, and a day later on March 11, they filed an <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20A150/172422/20210319132528733_20A__%20Application.pdf"">emergency application</a> to the Supreme Court to intervene on behalf of the government and stay the judgment from <i>Cook County</i>.

Despite the motion to intervene in the Seventh Circuit, on March 12, Judge Feinerman approved a stipulation by both parties to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, closing the civil case. The Seventh Circuit then went on to deny the states' motion to intervene 3 days later, on March 15.

As of April 15, 2021, the Public Charge Final Rule has been abandoned and vacated nationwide. The case has been closed in the district court. However, the application by the states to intervene in the Supreme Court remains open.","Designated as Magistrate Judge the Honorable Maria Valdez. Redacted Transcript Deadline set for 12/30/2019.

The Final Rule\'s Weighted Circumstances Test Discriminates Against Immigrants Of Color.\n132. During a press conference on August 2, 2017, President Trump\'s Senior Policy\nAdvisor on immigration and the alleged architect of the Final Rule, Stephen Miller, falsely\ncharged that ""roughly half of immigrant head of households in the United States receive some type of welfare benefit. That definition and instruction never made their way into a regulation. Inc. v. Davenport, 2016 WL 7212522, at *2 (N.D. Ill. Dec. 13, 2016), as is a request for a stay under 5 U.S.C. § 705, see Cronin v. U.S. Dep’t of Agric., Especially given the APA’s “generous review provisions,” Clarke, 479 U.S. at 395 (internal quotation marks omitted), these considerations place ICIRR’s claims “at the least[] ‘arguably within the zone of interests’” protected by the INA, Bank of Am. Thus, in saying that “[t]he term ‘likely to become a public charge’ is not associated with paupers or professional beggars, idiots, and certified physical and mental defectives,” id. at 457, Ex parte Horn held not that the 1917 Act ousted Gegiow’s view regarding the severity and duration of the economic circumstances that could result in an alien being deemed a public charge; rather, it held that the 1917 Act expanded the meaning of “public charge” to include persons who would be totally dependent on the government for noneconomic reasons like imprisonment. and English Law 196 (1888) (emphasis added). For example, both the 1933 and 1951 editions of Black’s Law Dictionary indicated that the term “public charge,” “[a]s used in” the 1917 Immigration Act, meant simply “one who produces a money charge upon, or an expense to, the public for support and care” -- without reference to the type of expense. 3009-674 to 3009-675.\n* * * * * Given Congress’s direction that “the availability of public benefits” should not be “an incentive for immigration to the United States,” 8 U.S.C. 1601(2), and its longstanding history of preserving flexibility in the meaning of “public charge,” the Rule “easily” qualifies as a reasonable interpretation of the statute, City & County of San Francisco, 944 F.3d at 799. 19A785), this Court already has determined that the government will suffer irreparable harm absent a stay. Yet the Court’s concerns over quick decisions wither when prodded by the Government in far less compelling circumstances— where the Government itself chose to wait to seek relief, and where its claimed harm is continuation of a 20-year status quo in one State. See Swanigan v. City of Chicago, 881 F.3d 577, 582 (7th Cir. 2013) (internal quotation marks omitted); see also Heng v. Heavner, Beyers & Mihlar, LLC, 849 F.3d 348, 354 (7th Cir. In setting forth the facts at the pleading stage, the court does not vouch for their accuracy. 2019) (“[E]vidence [of discriminatory purpose] may include the series of events leading up to a … decision, the context in which the decision was made, … [and] statements made by the decisionmaking body … .”) ( Even if the effect of the Rule is some reduction in the burden on federal taxpayers, Cook County has plausibly alleged that at the same time, the Rule will increase the burden on those same people in their capacity as state and local taxpayers, who will have to suffer the adverse effects of a substantial population with inadequate medical care, housing, and nutrition.\nFurthermore, though the purpose of the public-charge provision is to screen for and promote ""self-sufficiency"" among immigrants, it is not obvious what self-sufficiency means. But the link between these injuries and the purpose of the public-charge part of the statute is more attenuated, and thus it is harder to say that the injury ICIRR has asserted meets the ""zone-of-interests"" test.\nGiven Cook County\'s presence in the case, we need not resolve ICIRR\'s status definitively, and so we limit our discussion in the remainder of the opinion to Cook County. 8 U.S.C. § 1601(2).\nBoth parties also cite various other statutory provisions that they believe shed light on the meaning of the public-charge provision, including the requirement for some immigrants to obtain affidavits of support from sponsors, 8 U.S.C. § 1183a; an exception to the public-charge provision for immigrants who are victims of domestic violence and receive benefits in that capacity, id. §§ 1182(a)(4)(E), 1641(c); and several other statutes that extend, with varying conditions, certain benefits to immigrants, see, e.g., id. §§ 1611, 1621. 1927) (""In the face of [Gegiow] it is hard to say that a healthy adult immigrant, with no previous history of pauperism, and nothing to interfere with his chances in life but lack of savings, is likely to become a public charge within the meaning of the statute. DHS\'s system of counting and stacking benefits is hardly transparent, and so a rational person might err on the side of caution and refrain from seeking medical care, or food, or housing, even from a city, state, or tribe rather than the federal government. Immigrants thus reasonably anticipate that their receipt of benefits that are currently not covered could eventually hurt them if DHS alters the Rule in the future.\n\n\n\n \n \n \n\n\n\x0cIt was not enough for DHS simply to nod at this argument; it called for a serious explanation. Id.\nThis explains how DHS incorporated its understanding of ""self-sufficiency"" into the Rule. Valencia v. City of Springfield, 883 F.3d at 966. We also consider effects that granting or denying the preliminary injunction would have on the public. This case is about whether DHS has defined ""public charge"" too expansively and is therefore turning too many noncitizens away.\nThere are four major routes to obtaining the status of lawful permanent resident: humanitarian protection (refugees and asylees), the sponsorship of a family member, employment, and winning what is known as the green card lottery.[3] See U.S. DEP\'T OF HOMELAND SEC., The Secretary demurred, answering that ""the determination of the liability of arriving immigrants to become public charges is vested ... in the commissioners of immigration appointed by the State in which such immigrants arrive,"" and thus ""this Department must decline to interfere in the matter."" There is an obvious explanation for why Congress required supporting affidavits from family-based immigrants and not from employment-based immigrants or green card lottery winners: that is the only context in which it makes sense to demand this assurance. for Individual Freedom v. Van Hollen, 694 F.3d 108, 111 (D.C. Cir. And while housing benefits are covered by the public charge rule, 8 C.F.R. § 212.21, they are largely irrelevant because the number of noncitizens still within the grandfathering provision has presumably dwindled dramatically in the quarter century since the Welfare Reform Act was passed.\n[2] Hence the majority is wrong to treat the rule as unreasonable because it ""set[s] a trap for the unwary."" 134, 333 (2002) (codified as amended at 8 U.S.C. § 1612(a)(2)). 3d at 1023 (quoting DHS’s brief in opposition to Plaintiffs’ motion for preliminary injunction), this court concluded from an examination of contemporaneous court decisions, dictionaries, and commentary that “an alien [cannot] be deemed a public charge based on the receipt, or anticipated receipt, of a modest quantum of public benefits for short periods of time,” id. at 1026. 3d 109, 153 (D.D.C. 2019).\nDHS retorts that an order vacating the Final Rule without any geographic limitation would be akin to entering the kind of nationwide injunction that the Fourth Circuit and two Justices have criticized in other cases involving APA challenges to the Rule.

PN-IL-0009,"On March 15, 2001, the Chicago civil rights law firm Loevy & Loevy filed a civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking damages on behalf of plaintiff Joseph Lopez for alleged constitutional violations stemming from his arrest in July 2000 by Chicago police for a murder he did not commit.  Plaintiff alleged that after he was taken into custody in shooting death of a 12-year old girl, he was held by Chicago police in a in a nine-by-seven-foot interrogation room for four days, handcuffed to a ring on the wall.  He alleged he was deprived of sleep, beaten and threatened in an attempt to coerce him into a confessing to the murder.  Ultimately, Lopez gave a false confession, which he later recanted.  The confession did not match did not match the forensic evidence from the crime scene.  On the fifth day of his detention, police charged Lopez with murder and held a press conference to announce the charges.  That same day, a different man, Miguel Figueroa was arrested and confessed to the child's murder.  The charges against Lopez were dropped and this lawsuit followed.

Plaintiff's suit alleged Section 1983 claims against the City of Chicago and several detectives and police officers for excessive force, unlawful detention, police torture, and conspiracy in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. He also brought supplemental state law claims.  The defendants denied all allegations and the City moved to bifurcate the Section 1983 claims against it from the claims against the individuals officers to stay discovery against the City until after discovery against the individual officers was concluded.  The District Court (Judge Darrah) denied the request for bifurcation, but ordered that discovery against the City be stayed pending later reassessment. Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2002 WL 335346,  2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3458 (N.D.Ill. Mar 01, 2002).

Plaintiff then moved to amend his complaint to add class action claims to reform an unconstitutional Chicago Police Department practice known as the ""hold past court call"" procedure. Plaintiff alleged that this procedure allowed police to continue investigating and interrogating recent arrestees without taking them before a judicial official for a determination of probable cause.  The District Court (Judge Darrah) granted the motion over defendants' objections.  Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2002 WL 31415767, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20613 (N.D.Ill. Oct 25, 2002).  Plaintiff filed his second amended complaint with class allegations on November 12, 2002.  Discovery continued.

The District Court granted summary judgment on several claims against the two police officers who initially arrested plaintiff.  Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2004 WL 725790,  2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5371  (N.D.Ill. Mar 31, 2004).   Plaintiff decided to withdrew his request for class certification and the case proceeded on plaintiff's claims against the remaining defendants.

Note that after dropping the class action claims, plaintiff's attorneys, Loevy & Loevy, filed a separate class action lawsuit on October 21, 2004, challenging the detention practices of the Chicago Police Department.  That suit was styled Dunn v. City of Chicago [See PN-IL-0008 of this collection]

Following pre-trial motions, see Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2005 WL 563212 (N.D.Ill. Mar 08, 2005), the case proceeded to trial against the remaining individual defendants.  After 7 days of testimony, the District Court (Judge Deryeghiayan) refused to submit the majority of plaintiff's claims (claims for unlawful extended detention, unlawful conditions of confinement intention infliction of emotional distress) to the jury for deliberation and ruled that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The only claims to go to the jury were the excessive force and assault and battery claims against Officer Gomez, who allegedly punched plaintiff when driving him to the station for questioning. The jury found in favor of Officer Gomez.  Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2005 WL 711986, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6160 (N.D.Ill. Mar 23, 2005) Plaintiff appealed.  The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.  Lopez v. City of Chicago, 464 F.3d 711 (7th Cir.  2006). The Appeals Court found that Lopez was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his unlawful detention claim and that the trial court should have submitted the police torture and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims to the jury.

On remand, the case was settled on terms that were not made public.  Under the settlement, plaintiff's attorneys petitioned the Court for an award of attorney's fees.  The District Court (Judge Elaine E. Bucklo) awarded plaintiff $819,577.00 in fees, $11,537.12 for taxable expenses and $26,905.68 for non-taxable expenses.   Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2007 WL 4162805, 2007 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 85708 (N.D.Ill. Nov 20, 2007).

","Jurisdiction and Venue\n\n3.\n\nThis Court has jurisdiction of the action pursuant\n\nto 28 U.S.C. § 1331. During this time, Defendants also denied Plaintiff access to an attorney.\n22. This line-up conducted by the Defendant Police Officers, supposedly resulting in the positive identification of Plaintiff who was bald and ten years younger than the longerhaired shooter, was deeply flawed. Plaintiff realleges each of paragraphs 1-82 as if fully stated herein.\n84. However, the procedure is alive and well and still in use throughout the CPD.\n16. Mr. Lopez alleges, inter alia, that he was detained in excess of 48 hours based on CPD policy which prevents felony arrestees from receiving a probable cause hearing until the SAO approves charges and the hold past court call procedure and for purposes of continuing the investigation against him; that he was denied any facility for s~eeping during that time; and that he has suffered damages as result.\n29. During this approximately five day period, the Defendant officers and the CPD continued to investigate and develop evidence purportedly linking Mr. Lopez with the shooting.\n46. However, the facts of the statement conflicted with the true facts of the shooting. Plaintiff realleges each of the forgoing paragraphs as if fully stated herein.\n70. The misconduct described in this Count was undertaken with malice, willfulness, and reckless indifference to the rights of others.\n87. She also indicated that he was thin and medium to light skinned. BeBe was later brought to the station and interviewed by Detective Delucia. Lopez also claims that approximately one hour after prosecutors told Lopez they were seeking the death penalty against him, the CPD arrested Miguel Figueroa\n1\n\n\x0cLopez v. City of Chicago, Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2005)\n\nfor the crime. P. 8(b).\n*4 Lopez has provided no authority for the proposition that a defendant is required to introduce in its answer to the complaint the entire universe of facts that the defendant is going to bring out at trial as part of its defense. In Paragraph 26 Defendants admit that Lopez did not receive a judicial hearing to determine whether there was probable cause. ( Defendants will be allowed to present evidence that Lopez was detained in custody by police on prior occasions. Therefore, we grant in part and deny in part Lopez’s motion to bar evidence of his prior convictions and arrests.\n\nmotions in limine brief is properly spaced only for the first four lines. Lopez argues that he does not have sufficient information about the conviction to properly respond to the motion. Brady is the person designated by the City to examine the City records. Subsequently, in City of Riverside v. McLaughlin, 500 U.S. 44, 111 S.Ct.

It was just some voice that was coming from the back of my head just kept telling me yeah, you did shoot him. About 60 hours into his detention, Lopez gave a statement to Detectives Jacobs and Delafont in which he falsely confessed to having shot the twelve-year-old boy.\nThe details of Lopez\'s confession did not match the forensic evidence from the crime scene, and shortly thereafter Detective Jacobs returned to the interrogation room and angrily called Lopez a liar. On July 26 Figueroa confessed to the murder. Mendenhall v. Mueller Streamline Co., 419 F.3d 686, 692 (7th Cir.2005). Lopez\'s police practices expert testified that it would ""[a]bsolutely not"" be appropriate to confine an arrested person in an interrogation room for twenty-four hours, much less for four days. On this record, the district court\'s refusal to submit this claim to the jury was unjustified; the court impermissibly weighed the evidence and drew inferences in favor of the defendants rather than Lopez, contrary to Rule 50\'s governing standards. Id.; see also Willis, 999 F.2d at 287-89. At the time discovery is completed against the individual police officers, the parties and the Court will be able to reassess the case, including the prospects of settlement, the particular municipal policies or customs at issue, and the scope of discovery the Monell claims require.\nFor the reasons state above, the City’s Motion to Stay Discovery on Monell Policy Claims and Sever Such Claims For Later Resolution is denied in part and granted in part. 2505, 91 L.Ed.2d 202 (1986); Insolia v. Philip Morris, Inc., 216 F.3d 596, 599 (7th Cir.2000). There is no evidence at all that Myers and Gomez were responsible for the extended detention of Lopez once he was at the station. Dunn v. City of Elgin, 347 F.3d 641, (7th Cir.2003)(quoting Doe v. Calumet City 161 Ill.2d 374, 204 Ill.Dec. 274, 641 N.E.2d 498, 506 (Ill.1994)). During that period he was fed once and was allowed limited access to the bathroom, only after screaming for detectives to grant him permission to leave the room.\nLopez filed his initial nine-count complaint on March 15, 2001 alleging: (1) excessive force against Officer Gomez and a policy claim against the City under Monell v. Dep’t of Social Servs., Pursuant to the settlement agreement, plaintiff could seek reasonable attorneys’ fees.\nII.\nDefendants do not take issue with plaintiff’s entitlement to fees as a prevailing party under § 1988, but with the computation of the fee award in light of plaintiff’s dropped and unsuccessful claims. ( As to the remaining entries, plaintiff disputes these pertain to Monell discovery, which required discovery on whether the City had an unlawful practice or policy in place (contrary to the City’s assertions) and whether other detainees had been subjected to similar treatment under the practice or policy.\nDefendants’ objections rely heavily on the fact that on February 28, 2002 the court stayed all Monell discovery pending the completion of fact discovery against the individual officers.

NS-VA-0004,"The plaintiff was a naturalized U.S. Citizen denied boarding to a flight from Kuwait to the United States because of his alleged inclusion on the No Fly List. On January 18, 2011, he filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against the Department of Homeland Security (""DHS""), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (""FBI""), the Transportation and Security Administration (""TSA""), and the Terrorist Screening Center (""TSC""), which created and maintained the No Fly List. The plaintiff, represented by the Council on American Islamic Relations, alleged that his placement on the No Fly List constituted: (1) a violation of his right as a United States citizen to reside in the United States and re-enter it from abroad; (2) unlawful agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; and (3) a denial of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring defendants to remove him from the No-Fly List; inform him of the grounds for his inclusion on the No-Fly List; and provide him with an opportunity to rebut his inclusion. The plaintiff also sought monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and a declaration that the defendants violated his rights. The case was assigned to Judge Anthony J. Trenga.

Contemporaneously with the complaint, the plaintiff also filed an emergency motion with respect to his alleged inability to return to the U.S. from Kuwait. The relief requested in the motion became moot, however, when the plaintiff was permitted to return to the U.S. on January 21, 2011.

On June 3, 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff’s claims lies exclusively in the U.S. Court of Appeals under 49 U.S.C. § 46110, which gave the U.S. Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to certain orders of the TSA. Judge Trenga agreed and held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff's challenge to past or future restrictions on his ability to travel because such claims are ""inescapably intertwined"" with the review of TSA orders. 2011 WL 3820711. Instead of dismissing the plaintiff's claims, however, the court transferred the plaintiff's claims to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  

Before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the plaintiff contended that the district court did have jurisdiction, and thus, requested that his claims be remanded. On May 28, 2013, the Fourth Circuit agreed. In an order signed by the Court's clerk, the Fourth Circuit explained that 49 U.S.C. § 46110 did not evidence Congress' intent to exclude the plaintiff's challenge to past and future restricts on his ability to travel from consideration in the district court.

On remand, the defendants again filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the plaintiff's claims must be dismissed because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies, that he lacked standing, that his claims were not ripe for adjudication, and that he failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted.    

On January 22, 2014, Judge Trenga granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion.  2014 WL 243115. The Court held that the plaintiff was not required to exhaust administrative remedies, had standing, and that his claims were ripe. The Court then dismissed a portion of the plaintiff's first claim for relief, concluding that four to five day delay that the the plaintiff experienced in his ability to reenter the U.S. did not unduly burden his rights such that it constituted a constitutional deprivation. The court, however, found that the plaintiff's broader allegations in his first claim for relief of present and future harms from his inability to fly were sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss. The court also held that plaintiff's procedural due process claim was sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss as the plaintiff did not receive any notice of his inclusion or reasons for his inclusion. The parties then engaged in discovery for the next year.

On December 9, 2014, the plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment as to his procedural due process claim. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants failed to provide him with a meaningful opportunity to challenge his inclusion on the No Fly List, either before or after his inclusion, depriving him of various liberty interests. The defendants contended that the redress process established through the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (""TRIP"") was constitutionally sufficient. On July 16, 2015, the court issued an order partially granting the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the court concluded that the plaintiff was denied his Fifth Amendment right to an adequate opportunity to challenge his inclusion on the No Fly List. 

On April 13, 2015, the defendants filed a notice stating the government's new redress procedures for claims submitted through DHS regarding denial of boarding on a covered aircraft, and that these new procedures would be available to the plaintiff should he wish to use them. 

The plaintiff filed a fifth amended complaint on December 28, 2015. On March 3, 2016, using arguments that are unavailable on the docket, the defendants moved for summary judgment of the plaintiff’s substantive due process and non-delegation claims of the fifth amended complaint. That same day, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment of those same claims, arguing that  the No Fly List interfered with his fundamental right of movement and was not narrowly tailored and that the No Fly List was operating in the absence, and in some ways against, the wishes of Congress.

On July 20, 2017, Judge Trenga granted the defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment and denied the plaintiff’s. The court concluded that the No Fly List was not unconstitutional on substantive due process grounds because it was not unlawful under the non-delegation doctrine nor did it exceed agency authority. As such, the court entered judgment in favor of the United States and against the plaintiff.

The plaintiff appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Not long after, however, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed this appeal and the Fourth Circuit obliged on December 21, 2017. There are no pending motions or appeals so the case is presumably closed.

But more than a defamatory listing itself is necessary to state a claim. Unlike a boarding pass printing result, which has a binding legal effect upon the airline receiving that order, the ultimate letter from the TSA does not affect a change in legal obligation, which, if at all, is accomplished by the TSC and is not communicated to the listee or an airline until another boarding pass printing result is issued.\nD.

Even accepting as true Mohamed’s allegations—including that the government improperly placed him on the No Fly List and prevented him from boarding the January 16th flight—the four to five-day delay that Mohamed experienced in his ability to reenter the United States did not unduly burden his right of reentry and therefore, as a matter of law, did not constitute a constitutional deprivation.\n[7] Broader, however, are Mohamed’s allegations of present and future harms arising from his inability to fly.

NS-MI-0003,"On January 22, 2013, private individual filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1981, Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, and 49 U.S.C. § 40127(a). The plaintiff sued the US and Frontier Airlines. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and the ACLU, asked the court for compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and any other relief the Court may deem appropriate. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants violated her right to be free of discrimination as a passenger, as well as her right to equal protection and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

On September 11, 2011, the plaintiff was on a flight from Denver to Detroit. She was seated next to two men described as being of South Asian descent. The plaintiff did not know the men or communicate with them in any way throughout the flight. During the flight, the men began to exhibit suspicious behavior and Frontier Airlines was accordingly notified of a potential threat. In reporting this threat, the plaintiff was identified as part of the threat under the suspicion that she may have been traveling with the two men. When the plane landed, armed guards forcefully arrested the plaintiff and moved her to a detention facility in Wayne County, where she was held and searched for approximately four hours. The plaintiff alleged that since the police and TSA officers had no facts connecting her to criminal activity, they must have acted on the perceived ethnicity, national origin, or race of the plaintiff's name. The plaintiff was released without any charges. 

On May 20, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the equal protection claims against the named federal individuals. The Court (Judge Terrence Berg) held that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity and denied the motion to dismiss.

On March 21, 2014, a motion to dismiss Count IV  was brought by Defendants Robert Ball, John Brand, Paul Brumley, Nathaniel Devins, and David Lakatos, all of whom are federal law enforcement officials or agents (""Federal Agent Defendants""), and a motion for partial judgment on the pleadings to dismiss Count IV brought by Defendants Jeremy Bohn, Corporal Bradley, Lieutenant M. Wasiukanis, Captain Patrick Driscoll, Mark DeBeau, Officer Grant,Toya Parker, Detective Carmona, and Officer Johnson, who are law enforcement officers of the Wayne County Airport Authority (""WCAA Defendants""). The motions are brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(c), respectively, and both assert that the individual law enforcement defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiff's claims that her arrest and detention on September 11, 2011, was in violation of her rights to Equal Protection. The court denied the motion. (Hebshi v. United States, 12 F. Supp. 3d 1036 (E.D. Mich. 2014))

On July 18, 2014, the court denied a motion submitted by the individual plaintiffs for partial summary judgment as to Counts V and VI. The motion is brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), asserting that the WCAA Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiff's claim that her arrest, detention, and search were in violation of her Fourth Amendment rights under the United States
Constitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court dismissed the motion. (Hebshi v. United States, 32 F. Supp. 3d 834 (E.D. Mich. 2014), appeal dismissed (Feb. 6, 2015))

Throughout the November and December 2014, several settlement conferences were held between the remaining defendants and the plaintiff--wherein a settlement was reached between the parties. 

Under the settlement terms that have been disclosed, the plaintiff will receive $40,000 from the federal government to compensate her for the severe humiliation she suffered. Additionally, under the settlement, Frontier has agreed to amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and to provide all new employees with training on that revision. Frontier also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given the appropriate attention.

The federal government provided sworn statements promising that this incident did not land Hebshi on any federal terrorism watch lists. The airport police have similarly provided assurances that no record of the arrest remains.

During the course of litigation, the Wayne County Airport Authority independently implemented changes to its police policies and training that address many of Hebshi's concerns.

Ms. Hebshi, by her attorneys, now challenges the discriminatory conduct of Frontier Airlines, which identified her as a “suspicious” passenger based on her ethnicity, race or national origin, resulting in her arrest and detention, as a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981; Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; and 49 U.S.C. § 40127(a).\n7. Defendant John Brand was, at all times relevant to this action, a Special Agent with the FBI. At this time, his identity is not known to Ms. Hebshi. He is sued in his individual capacity.\n17.

In September 2011, Ms. Hebshi spent Labor Day weekend with her sister in San Francisco, California. Instead, at approximately 4:25 p.m., Defendants Carmona, Bohn, Johnson and Defendant ICE Special Agent Brumley, along with other officers, boarded the plane, heavily armed, and ran down the aisle where Ms. Hebshi and the other two men in her row were seated.\n69. Ms. Hebshi and the two men in her row were then forcefully rushed down the aisle and stairs and out of the plane.\n74. After approximately two more hours, an officer came to get Ms. Hebshi and brought her to an interview room where an FBI agent and, upon information and belief, a TSA agent awaited her. Defendant Unknown TSA Officer 2 then came into Ms. Hebshi’s cell with Ms. Hebshi’s phone and required that Ms. Hebshi show the Twitter messages she had sent out from the airplane upon landing, as well as her Facebook profile. Ms. Hebshi re-alleges and incorporates by reference the allegations contained in the previous paragraphs as if fully set forth herein. Ms. Hebshi suffered intentional discrimination from Frontier Airlines, which singled her out as a suspect because of her name.

PN-CA-0023,"On October 6, 2009, two individuals who had their DNA collected pursuant to a California statute filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs challenged a provision of California law which mandates the DNA collection of any individual arrested for or charged with a felony. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and claimed that the practice violates substantive and procedural Due Process, as well as the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the practice infringes on rights guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution because it mandates the DNA collection of all persons <i>arrested</i> for a felony--without requiring a warrant or that the individual actually be charged with or convicted of a felony. 

In 2004, California passed Proposition 69, which expanded the scope of the state's mandatory DNA collection laws, Cal. Penal Code. §§ 295 et seq. Prior to the enactment of Proposition 69, California law provided that only persons convicted of certain felonies were subject to the mandatory DNA testing program. Under the revised statute, which took effect on January 1, 2009, any individual arrested for a felony must provide their DNA for analysis and storage in a national database accessible by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Proposition 69 also eliminated language in the statute which provided for the automatic expungement of a person's DNA samples and database entries if that individual's conviction was reversed.

On December 1, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two more plaintiffs, bringing the total plaintiffs to four. None of the plaintiffs were convicted of charges related to the arrests which led to the collection of their DNA; three never had charges filed, and one had his case dismissed. 

On December 23, 2009, the District Court (Judge Charles R. Breyer) denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0003.pdf""><i>Haskell v. Brown</i>, 677 F. Supp. 2d 1187, 1190 (N.D. Cal. 2009), <i>aff'd sub nom. Haskell v. Harris</i>, 669 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2012)</a>. The court found that although the plaintiffs had established that arrestees have greater privacy interests than convicted felons, they had failed to show that this interest outweighs the government's compelling interest in using arrestees' DNA to solve past crimes. The court reasoned that as a result, the plaintiffs had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits or that the balance of equities tipped in their favor.

On January 29, 2010--shortly after denying the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction--the District Court granted the motion for class certification. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0006.pdf"">Minute Entry Granting Mot. for Class Certification</a>. In doing so, the court adopted plaintiffs' proposed class description. This class description is ""all persons who have been, are, or will be, compelled to submit to the search and seizure of their body tissue and DNA pursuant to California Penal Code § 296(a)(2)(C) solely because they have been arrested for, or charged with, a felony offense.""  Proposed Order Granting Mot. for Class Certification.

The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's denial of the preliminary injunction, but on February 23, 2012, a divided three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit (Judge Milan D. Smith, Jr. writing for the majority) affirmed the District Court's denial of plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Haskell v. Harris</i>, 669 F.3d 1049, 1051 (9th Cir. 2012)</a>. The majority applied a ""totality of the circumstances"" test, balancing arrestees' privacy interests against the government's need for their DNA samples. The court concluded that ""the Government's compelling interests far outweigh arrestees' privacy concerns,"" and affirmed on that basis. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Id.</i></a>

Judge William A. Fletcher filed a dissenting opinion, in which he analogized the collection of arrestees' DNA to taking their fingerprints. Judge Fletcher argued that because in the absence of a warrant or reasonable suspicion an arrestee's fingerprints may only be taken for identification purposes--and not solely for an investigative purpose--the same logic applied to the collection of an arrestee's DNA. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Id.</i> at 1066</a>. Judge Fletcher felt that this made Proposition 69 unconstitutional, rendering the majority's ""totality of the circumstances"" test irrelevant. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Id.</i> at 1080</a>. However, he also noted that if he were to apply that test, he would find the ""strength of plaintiffs' privacy interests much stronger."" <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Id.</i></a>

After the Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the District Court's decision, the plaintiffs petitioned the Ninth Circuit to rehear the appeal en banc. On July 25, 2012, the Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en banc. <i>Haskell v. Harris</i>, 686 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir. 2012). After oral argument on the rehearing, the Ninth Circuit issued an order stating that it would not rule on the appeal until the U.S. Supreme Court decided a related issue in <i>Maryland v. King</i>. In that case, Maryland's DNA collection laws were being challenged.

In June 2013, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 5-4, held that Maryland's DNA collection laws were constitutional. The Ninth Circuit subsequently ordered both sides to submit supplemental briefs and scheduled additional oral argument for December 2013. <i>Haskell v. Harris</i>, 727 F.3d 916 (9th Cir. 2013).

On March 20, 2014, the en banc court affirmed the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction. In a per curiam opinion, the appeals court held that after <i>Maryland v. King</i>, California's DNA collection scheme was constitutional. Further, the appeals court declined the plaintiffs' request to enter a preliminary injunction applicable to only a smaller class consisting of individuals arrested for certain felonies not covered by <i>King</i>. <i>Haskell v. Harris</i>, 745 F.3d 1269 (9th Cir. 2014). 

On July 18, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to create subclasses. Proposed subclass A would include all persons arrested on suspicion of a felony but never charged with a
crime. Proposed subclass B would include only persons arrested for non-serious, non-violent felonies who were not actually charged. 

On that same date, the state filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that because California's DNA collection law was materially indistinguishable from the Maryland law upheld in <i>King</i>, neither the plaintiffs nor any possible class fell outside the wide parameters of <i>King</i> and the case was therefore over. 

On December 3, 2014, however, the district court stayed the case pending final resolution of a similar challenge to California's DNA Act in state court. In April 2018, the California Supreme Court upheld the state's DNA Act under both federal and California law as to the felony arrestee in that case. <i>People v. Buza</i>, 4 Cal. 5th 658 (2018). 

On June 22, 2018, Judge Breyer granted the state's motion for judgment on the pleadings and entered judgment for the state. <i>Haskell v. Brown</i>, 317 F. Supp. 3d 1095 (N.D. Cal. 2018). The court rejected the plaintiffs' proposed ""rule"" that would allow law enforcement to seize samples from all felony arrestees, but that would prevent law enforcement from analyzing those samples until a prosecutor has filed charges. Further, the court rejected the plaintiffs' arguments distinguishing <i>King</i>. First, the court explained that the plaintiffs understated the state's interests in taking, analyzing, and retaining DNA from people who are not charged with any offense or are discharged for lack of probable cause. Specifically, the court held that the state has a significant interest in the identification of arrestees, in accurately assessing the danger an arrestee poses to the public, and in exoneration. Second, the court noted that the individual interest was no different than that in <i>King</i>. Thus, in weighing the state's significant interest against the individual's modest interest, the court deemed the searches reasonable. Finally, the plaintiffs attempted to distinguish <i>King</i> based on three differences between the California and Maryland laws:  (1)
arrestee DNA samples are analyzed before arraignment in California; (2) more crimes
qualify for mandatory DNA analysis in California; (3) records and samples are not
automatically expunged in California. The court held that none of these three differences were constitutionally significant.

FA-DC-0020,"On February 29, 2016, a U.S. Army Captain and member of the Sikh faith filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sued the United States Department of Defense and the Army, among others, under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The plaintiff, represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the Sikh Coalition, and private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief prohibiting the U.S. Army from forcing him to compromise his religious exercise. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the U.S. Army violated his First Amendment right to free expression of his religion. The defendants had required him to undergo extensive and repetitive testing to confirm that he could properly wear a combat helmet and a safety mask, while other soldiers with long hair and beards had not been subjected to the same testing.  

Prior to this action, the plaintiff was given temporary accommodations to keep his hair and beard unshorn and to wear a turban. However, these accommodations were set to expire on March 31. On February 29, the plaintiff filed a temporary restraining order preventing the defendants from subjecting him to non-standard or discriminatory testing. On March 3, Judge Beryl A. Howard granted the plaintiff’s motion and enjoined the defendants from subjecting the plaintiff to any such testing during the pendency of the litigation. 168 F.Supp.3d 216.

The plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on February 29, requesting that the U.S. Army grant him a permanent religious accommodation for his beard, hair, and turban. Judge Howell denied this motion on May 6, 2016, partially because the preliminary injunction would essentially encompass the relief sought in the underlying complaint. In the same memorandum opinion, Judge Howell also denied the plaintiff’s motion to consolidate his case with another Sikh accommodation case because the plaintiffs in that case were reservists awaiting training rather than a West Point graduate on active duty as in this case. Additionally, the plaintiffs in the second case had not been forced to undergo the same testing that this plaintiff had objected to. 185 F. Supp. 3d 11.

On March 31, 2016, the defendants filed a notice that they had extended the plaintiff’s temporary accommodation to one year, or less in the event that military necessity assigned the plaintiff to another unit. In response, on May 23, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint stating that the extension did not negate the Army’s discriminatory regulations and practices. On June 20, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. 

On July 4, 2016, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice. In his filing, the plaintiff’s dismissal was made with the expectation that Sikh Americans would be successfully integrated into the U.S. military outside the context of this legal proceeding. This conclusion was supported by the following facts: (1) the defendants granted the plaintiff a ‘long-term accommodation’ which extended his earlier accommodation for at least one year from March 31, 2016; (2) the defendants had repeatedly written assurances that the plaintiff would not be subject to heightened, individualized testing concerning his helmet and safety mask; (3) while the Assistant Secretary of the Army intended to re-evaluate the plaintiff’s accommodation the following year, the plaintiff would not need to submit a new accommodation request; (4) the defendants planned to develop uniform standards for religious accommodations; (5) the plaintiff was not required to submit a new accommodation request with every new assignment, transfer of duty station, etc.; (6) no change would be made to the plaintiff’s accommodation without the evaluation being expeditiously forwarded to the Assistant Secretary; and (7) that a modification that substantially burdened the plaintiff’s religious exercise would only be permissible where the defendants could prove that they had a compelling interest to require modification, that modification was in furtherance of that interest, and that there was no less restrictive means of furthering that interest. These facts indicated that the plaintiff would not be subjected to adverse treatment by virtue of his faith for at least one year, by which time the plaintiff expected that the army would have legally sufficient accommodation guidelines in place. 

On July 5, 2016, the case was dismissed without prejudice and signed by Judge Beryl A. Howell. The case is now closed.","[""Case 1:16-cv-00399-BAH Document 1 Filed 02/29/16 Page 1 of 39\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA\n\nSIMRATPAL SINGH, 8818 Moverly Ct. 984479) McDermott Will & Emery LLP 500 North Capitol Street, N.W.

Rather, soldiers are left to freely try on different helmets and make their own assessment of fit. This is consistent with the experience of other soldiers. None were ever subjected to extensive testing because of their religion. It should only be used when there is an actual need to wear the protective mask in a real tactical operation.” Over the last six years, three other Sikhs have been granted religious accommodations, allowing them to serve in the Army with their articles of faith intact.\n144. In June 2014, he received an Army Commendation Medal for his selfless service and dedication to duty. He is currently in the Individual Ready Reserve. Captain Singh incorporates by reference all preceding paragraphs. The Army’s discriminatory testing and regulations impose a substantial burden on Captain Singh’s religious exercise.\n155. Captain Singh’s sincerely held religious beliefs prohibit him from removing his turban, cutting his hair, or shaving his beard. Declare that the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution requires Defendants to cease discriminating against Captain Singh and accommodate Captain Singh’s religious exercise in maintaining uncut hair and a beard and wearing a turban.\nd. 5 (asserting that the Army must conduct the “individualized testing” on the plaintiff to “understand [safety] risks to the greatest extent possible before making a final decision on CPT Singh’s religious accommodation and, if he is granted an accommodation, the scope of that accommodation”).\nThe issue before this Court on the TRO application is not whether compliance with the Army grooming and appearance regulations would substantially burden the plaintiff’s religious exercise rights. 2014) (quoting Kaemmerling v. Lappin, 553 F.3d 669, 678 (D.C. Cir. Nevertheless, the Court is persuaded that requiring the plaintiff to undergo the specialized testing for further processing of his religious accommodation request is a substantial burden when such testing is not required for soldiers to obtain exceptions from the Army uniform and grooming regulations on grounds other than adherence to the Sikh religious articles of faith.\nThe testing ordered in this case is not required of any other soldier, including soldiers who “use relaxed grooming standards” on military missions. 6, 11–12, 14 (attesting, from personal experience and observations as an active duty officer deployed to Afghanistan in 2011, who was required to have “enhanced familiarity with the use of the Army’s standard-issue M-40 protective mask and Kevlar helmet” for his assignment, that Special Forces soldiers who “had beards and long hair” and “did not have to undergo specialized fitting for protective masks or helmets”).\nThe defendants proffer that helmet testing, or “fitting,” for Special Forces soldiers is not necessary because “it’s the way their hairstyle operates. 5–6 (“express[ing] concern” about “some Sikh soldiers, following a religious accommodation” and wearing a helmet “with unshorn hair tucked under the helmet and a cloth headcovering” because performance of the helmet could be “degraded to a level that could compromise a soldier’s safety” from a “geometry deviation”).\n20\n\n\x0cTesting the plaintiff right now, however, may not allow the defendants to evaluate the fit of the plaintiff’s helmet under the specific conditions that are the cause of concern. 3, the Army has granted permanent religious accommodations in the past to other Sikh soldiers without any specialized testing. at 866.\nThe defendants argue that they are in a “Catch 22 position” where, under RFRA and, specifically, Holt, they must do an “individualized assessment” for the plaintiff’s accommodation request, but an unfavorable ruling on the plaintiff’s TRO application will prohibit them from “conduct[ing] the tests that [they] believe are necessary” to determine whether the plaintiff’s helmet and gas mask fit properly. ”\nOn the other hand, the public has a significant interest in having a diverse military, reflective of the composition of our country and accepting of religious minorities. 2014) (alteration in original) (quoting Sherley v.

PC-MI-0009,"On May 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated an investigation into the conditions of confinement at the Crane Correctional Facility in Coldwater, Michigan and the Scott Correctional Facility in Plymouth, Michigan (medium security prisons for women) pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  The state refused to allow the DOJ access to the prisons to conduct an investigation, and declined to negotiate with the DOJ or resolve the allegations.

On March 27, 1995, the DOJ issued a findings letter regarding the results of the CRIPA investigation, which was conducted solely through prisoner interviews during visiting hours, as the DOJ had not been allowed access to the physical facilities.  The letter detailed findings of sexual abuse of female inmates by guards (including rapes), lack of adequate medical care, lack of mental health services, grossly deficient sanitation, crowding, and other threats to the physical safety and well-being of inmates in violation of their constitutional rights.  On March 10, 1997, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against the state of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1997 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Flint office, alleging that the state had violated the rights of women prisoners at Scott and Crane to be free from sexual misconduct and unlawful invasions of privacy, and to receive appropriate medical and mental health care. The medical and mental health care claims were later withdrawn.

The case had received the docket number 97-40053 in Flint, but it was quickly transferred to Detroit and given a new docket number (97-71514).  It was consolidated for discovery purposes with another case brought by women prisoners, Nunn v. Mich. Dept. of Corrections, 2:96-cv-71416, (E.D. Mich) (PC-MI-0017).  

After considerable discovery, the state and the federal government (but not the private plaintiffs in Nunn) entered into a Settlement Agreement on May 25, 1999. The District Court (Judge John Corbett O'Meara) approved the settlement agreement as a court order on September 30, 1999. The agreement provided for considerable changes to Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) policies and procedures relating to sexual misconduct. Among other things, the agreement included: preemployment screenings, staff trainings, inmate education, facilitation of inmate and staff reporting of sexual misconduct allegations, investigation of sexual misconduct allegations, approach and response to misconduct, monitoring of inmate bathroom, dressing and shower areas, pat-down searches, and inmate screenings. It further set forth terms for quality assurance and for DOJ monitoring for compliance with the terms of the agreement.   

Following execution of this settlement agreement, the case was conditionally dismissed by Judge O'Meara on September 28, 1999, pending Michigan's compliance with the terms of the agreement.  The case was placed on the court's inactive docket during this time, and the parties agreed upon an expert, Patrick McManus, to assess Michigan's compliance with the settlement agreement three and six months after its execution. The U.S. filed a memo in support of its stipulation to conditionally dismiss the case in March 2000 indicating that the expert had found Michigan to be in substantial compliance with the terms of the settlement.

The court entered an order of conditional dismissal of the case on August 17, 2000. As part of its subsequent compliance efforts, the Michigan Department of Corrections established a policy barring men from serving as resident officers in housing units in women's prisons, and began the process of replacing those positions with female officers. 

After the directive to staff housing units with female officers, male corrections officers filed a separate lawsuit alleging gender discrimination. (Everson v. Michigan Dept. of Corrections, 391 F.3d 737 (6th Cir. 2004). In December 2002, the compliance expert filed a final report concluding that defendants were in substantial compliance with much of the agreement, but because of Michigan's ongoing efforts to staff housing units with female officers, that portion of the settlement would be subject to additional monitoring. Judge O'Meara granted the parties' stipulation for Partial Unconditional Dismissal of the case in February 2003, agreeing to up to one year of continued monitoring only on the issue of female housing guards, given a pending appeal in the Everson case (the district court in that case had found the Department of Corrections could not designate such positions as ""female-only"" - that issue was being contested on appeal).  In October 2004, the defendants sought full unconditional dismissal of the case, given that the timeline for continued monitoring of the housing situation had expired (even though the Everson decision remained pending). The 6th Circuit finally issued its ruling in Everson in December 2004 (391 F.3d 737, 6th Cir. 2004), concluding that female gender was a bonafide occupational qualification for housing unit guards in women's prisons. Rehearing en banc in the Everson case was denied in March 2005.

Subsequently, on September 29, 2005, the Defendants withdrew their Motion for full unconditional dismissal of this action. Thus, all that was left of the case was the issue of the staffing of housing units by women.  That issue was finally dismissed on April 25, 2007, after the state apparently attested that only female officers were assigned to housing units in all facilities covered by the settlement agreement.

NS-DC-0115,"On June 29, 2017, the James Madison Project, Noah Shachtman, and Betsy Woodruff sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The James Madison Project (JMP) is an organization established in 1998 ""to promote government accountability and the reduction of secrecy, as well as [to educate] the public on issues relating to intelligence and national security."" Noah Schactman is the current Editor-in-Chief (previously the Executive Editor) of The Daily Beast, and Betsy Woodruff was a politics reporter for the publication at the time. Private counsel represented plaintiffs, who filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Plaintiffs sought disclosure of agency records by DHS and its subordinate entities: the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Specifically, plaintiffs sought the disclosure of records clarifying the extent to which U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs) were coerced into surrendering their residency statuses, once DHS began implementing President Trump's Jan. 27 <a href=""https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-02-01/pdf/2017-02281.pdf"">Executive Order 13769</a> but before DHS stopped enforcing it on Feb. 4. According to plaintiffs, lawyers for some travelers affected by the EO claimed their clients were, during this implementation period, pressured to sign I-407 forms surrendering their LPR status.

The complaint alleged that on Mar. 3, 2017, plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request to the defendant federal agencies seeking copies of records memorializing:
1. Instructions or guidelines – including verbal instructions memorialized in writing – provided to CBP officials with respect to agency practice for presenting I-407 forms to individuals impacted by the EO;
2. Communications between CBP officials – including verbal communications memorialized in writing – mentioning I-407 forms between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5;  
3. Any documentation tabulating or calculating the number of individuals who signed I-407 forms between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5;  
4. Copies of the actual I-407 forms signed between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5.

The complaint further alleged that, to date, the plaintiffs had not received a substantive response from any of the defendant agencies, and that the plaintiffs had constructively exhausted all required administrative remedies. The plaintiffs sought a disclosure order under FOIA, legal fees, and expedited action.

(Plaintiff James Madison Project also has two similar FOIA cases in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, summarized in this Clearinghouse: one by the Daily Beast against the Department of Justice (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15676"">NS-DC-0106</a>) and one by Politico against DHS (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15678"">NS-DC-0107</a>).

On June 29, the case was assigned to Judge James E. Boasberg.

On Sept. 7, the parties reported that USCIS and CBP were searching for records responsive to plaintiff's request and needed another month to prepare a list. On Oct. 10, the parties reported the following: TSA had located no responsive documents; USCIS had located no responsive records for some requests and had withheld responsive records for other requests due to privacy; and CBP had located a few responsive records.

Judge Boasberg then ordered defendant (USCIS and CBP) to provide its first production of non-exempt portions of responsive records by Nov. 6 and its second production by Dec. 7.

On Nov. 6, the parties reported that defendants were following the schedule ordered by Judge Boasberg. 

The following status report, of Jan. 5, 2018, noted that USCIS and CBP had both produced more responsive non-exempt records and informed plaintiff that the search was completed. The parties agreed to meet to confer on next steps.

The Feb. 1 status report stated that the parties needed more time to discuss search declarations, before deciding whether to brief motions. A status report filed on Apr. 13 informed the Court that plaintiffs accepted TSA's productions and the sufficiency of USCIS's and CBP's searches, but would challenge denials and redactions of some of USCIS's and CBP's productions. Status reports filed October through December indicated the production was ongoing. 

Though the documents released by the government are not available online, <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/border-patrol-ordered-to-block-congressmen-during-travel-ban"">this news article</a> references some of their contents. 

On June 15, 2018, the defendants submitted a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the I-407 forms in question were exempt and properly withheld. The plaintiffs responded to the motion on July 16, claiming that the categorical refusal to produce the I-407 forms was improper and that their redactions were unjustified. After a conference call on October 3, the defendant submitted a status report on October 5, with the defendant’s agreement to respond to the plaintiff’s FOIA requests and a proposed schedule. The court, as agreed in the report, ordered the defendant to provide rolling productions every 60 days of the I-407 forms and a joint status report every 45 days.

Production followed the next few months. On December 26, 2018, the defendant moved for a stay of production schedule due to lapse of appropriations, which resulted in a temporary prohibition of DOJ’s work. Two days later, the court granted the motion. According to the February 1, 2019 status report, the funding was restored and the defendants had completed their required production on December 18, 2018. The parties then continued to provide status reports regarding attorney fees. 

On April 19, 2019, the plaintiffs submitted a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, and the court ordered dismissal the same day. The case is now closed.

PC-NJ-0024,"On November 5, 2015, the plaintiffs, nine pretrial detainees, filed this class action in the United States District Court of New Jersey. The plaintiffs sued Middlesex County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the deprivation of rights secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, asked the court to declare that the conditions in solitary confinement were unconstitutional, to enjoin Middlesex County to take all of its inmates out of solitary confinement, and to award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the conditions in C-Pod, the solitary confinement unit in Middlesex County Jail, were unconstitutional. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that they were locked in a small cell alone almost continuously; could not interact with other inmates; could not be visited by family; could not participate in religious, educational or rehabilitative programs; and were never allowed outdoors. 

The plaintiffs sought class action status. However, on January 4, 2016, Judge Peter G. Sheridan granted the plaintiffs' request to withdraw their pending motion for class certification without prejudice so that the ACLU attorneys could get acclimated to the case before proceeding with a dispositive motion. 

The parties then began settlement conversations. On May 24, 2017, the Court stayed discovery in order to further facilitate the parties’ settlement discussions. The parties reached a settlement with eight of the nine plaintiffs signing the agreement by June 19, 2018. The ninth plaintiff indicated he was not unhappy with the agreement, but did not want to sign. After failing to show and respond to requests to explaining absence from a scheduled conference, Magistrate Judge Tonianne J. Bongiovanni recommended this plaintiff’s claims be dismissed with prejudice. 2018 WL 4006809. Judge Peter G. Sheridan adopted the recommendation and dismissed this plaintiff’s claims with prejudice on August 22, 2018. 2018 WL 4005749.

The eight remaining plaintiffs entered a private settlement agreement with the defendants on September 25, 2018. Under the settlement agreement, the county would continue to operate a precautionary supervision unit, but also provide 28 hours per week out of cells, access to recreation time, in-unit programming, and law library services. Protections used would involve less restrictive security measures. Disciplinary detention could no longer exceed 15 days for a single disciplinary charge and 30 days for multiple disciplinary charges. The county also implemented a mental health screening policy that allowed the director of mental health to stop inappropriate placements in solitary confinement. The settlement agreement permitted the plaintiffs’ counsel access to people detained in the jail, jail records, and the facility itself to ensure full compliance with the settlement. The defendants agreed to pay $11,123 in attorneys’ fees and cost. Under the agreement, any alleged non-compliance would first be brought to the defendant’s counsel, with the opportunity for mediation. The settlement agreement was enforceable for two years. If the mediation failed to resolve the issue, plaintiffs were permitted to move the Court for reinstatement or ask for a one-time one-year extension of the agreement. The two-year enforcement period began on the date the parties executed the agreement.

Judge Peter G. Sheridan entered a stipulated of dismissal on October 25, 2018. As of March 21, 2019, the settlement is still in force.","Civil Action No._____________________\n\nINTRODUCTION Plaintiffs are inmates housed at the Middlesex County Jail in “C-Pod,” a unit for solitary confinement. Plaintiffs are locked in a small cell alone almost continuously, where they languish in a state of forced idleness. They cannot participate in religious, educational or rehabilitative programs. Mr. Lazar has been in C-Pod since February 2015. He is also serving a sentence in Pennsylvania. Plaintiff Sean Pershing is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since September 2015. Plaintiff Patrick O’Dwyer is a pretrial detainee housed in C-Pod since November 2014. There are questions of law or fact common to the class. This experience includes prosecuting class action claims on behalf of inmates in county jails and state prisons throughout New Jersey. Aside from a small window and a slot for food, the doors are solid metal. There is no chair for the desk, so inmates must either sit on the concrete floor or the bed.\n4\n\n\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 5 of 13 PageID: 5\n24. Inmates are provided with only one, thin blanket, which exacerbates the discomfort.\n27. There is black mold in the shower facilities. The hourly schedule for when an inmate may leave his cell is not consistent. C. Additionally, the physical layout of the attorney-client meeting room impairs an inmate’s access to his attorney. These types of conditions may cause prolonged or permanent psychiatric disability, including impairments which destroy the inmate's capacity to reintegrate into the community upon release.\n47. 2187, 2210 (2015) (Kennedy, J., concurring).\n8\n\n\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 1 Filed 11/05/15 Page 9 of 13 PageID: 9\nC. President Obama recently directed the Attorney General to review the overuse of solitary confinement across American prisons.5\nD. The American Bar Association now recommends that “[s]egregated housing should be for the briefest term and under the least restrictive conditions practicable and consistent with the rationale for placement and with the progress achieved by the prisoner. Whether solitary confinement should be abolished altogether is debatable. These changes are also financially feasible. The above facts are incorporated by reference here as if set forth at length. In light of the known effects of solitary confinement, the conditions in C-Pod are not reasonably related to legitimate purposes.\n58. A week\n\nafter Plaintiffs filed their Complaint, they sought to certify a class. ( See Letter Order of 5/25/2017; Docket Entry No. of Proceedings of 7/26/2017 at 4:7-22; Docket Entry No.41). DUDDY: Thank you, Your Honor.\nOn Monday -- on the morning of Monday, July 16th, I texted Mr. Ratliff a picture of the Court’s order to show cause. And I finished the phone call by asking that he text me back to confirm receipt of my earlier text messages. When you mentioned that you believe he understood the import of the order to show cause, did that include -- is it your impression that Mr. Ratliff realized that he could be dismissed as a complainant in this matter if he did not come forward today?\nMR. Where such failures have occurred, dismissal may be an appropriate penalty. Id. Generally, in determining whether to impose an involuntary order of dismissal with prejudice, the Court considers the factors set forth in Poulis v. State Farm Casualty Co., 747 F.2d , 863, 868 (3d Cir. See Mindek v. Rigatti, 964 F.2d 1369, 1373 (3d Cir. For the reasons that follow, the Court finds that under the circumstances presented here, the Poulis factors support the dismissal of Ratliff’s claims with prejudice:\n7\n\n\x0cCase 3:15-cv-07920-PGS-TJB Document 42 Filed 07/31/18 Page 8 of 11 PageID: 157\n1. In fact, despite being given every opportunity to litigate his claims, Ratliff has elected to no longer participate in the case he initiated. For the duration of this Settlement Agreement and Release, the Defendant shall continue to operate the Precautionary Supervision Unit (""PSU"") in a\nmanner that provides inmates with at least:\n\na.\n\n28 hours per week out of lock time, security permitting. Twice per year, an ""attorney visit"" will be permitted which means an escorted walk-through of the MCACC that includes full access to: the administrative segregation and disciplinary detention units, PSU, areas used for programming and recreation, areas used for medical and mental health treatment (including suicide watch). Plaintiffs may bring experts at their\nown expense on the attorney visits. The parties understand and agree that said Order will remain in effect for the duration ofthe two-year term of agreement and any extension thereto.\n\nAt the conclusion of the two-year term of agreement, Plaintiffs shall give written notice\n\n3 ofl5\n\n\x0cto counsel for Defendant certifying that all Confidential Material and information has been destroyed, as set forth in Paragraph 12 ofthe Confidentiality and Protective Order.\nNotice. In the event of any reported alleged non-compliance by Defendant with a material provision of this Agreement, counsel to the parties shall meet and confer in an effort to resolve the reported alleged noncompliance within 30 days of receipt of written notice of the reported alleged non-compliance.

FA-NY-0007,"On October 20, 2016, Color of Change and Center for Constitutional Rights, nonprofit civil rights advocacy and communications organizations, brought this action under the Freedom of Information Act (""FOIA"") in the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, represented by an attorney from the Milton Kramer Law Clinic at Case Western, an attorney from the Center for Constitutional Rights, and an attorney for Clifford Chance, sued the U.S. Department of Homeland security (""DHS"") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (""FBI""), seeking declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief to compel the defendants to produce records related to federal government surveillance and monitoring of protest activities related to the Movement for Black Lives (""MBL""). 

Following the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, MBL gained national scope and influence, drawing public attention to police violence and advocating for police reform and racial justice. The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that government documents, news reports, and first-hand accounts demonstrated that the defendants, and state and local law enforcement agencies, had engaged in surveillance and monitoring of MBL demonstrations and individual activists aligned with the movement, using tactics and measures commonly reserved for counterterrorism and national security related purposes. They further alleged that this monitoring of legitimate protest activities undermined the First Amendment's protection of political speech, and would chill valuable public debate about police violence, including use of deadly force, criminal justice, and racial inequities. 

On July 5 2016, the plaintiffs submitted their FOIA request to DHS and the FBI: 

<b>DHS</b>
On July 18, 2016, DHS's privacy office sent a letter to the plaintiffs acknowledging receipt of the request. DHS denied the plaintiffs' request for expedited processing and a fee waiver, which the plaintiffs appealed. On August 29, 2016, DHS acknowledged that it had received the appeal, but never responded to it. 

On September 27, 2016, the plaintiffs received a response from the Office of Intelligence & Analysis, a component of DHS, claiming that a search of its files revealed no records responsive to the plaintiffs' request. The plaintiffs appealed that decision based on the Office of Intelligence and Analysis' failure to perform an adequate search for records and its improper reliance on FOIA exemptions to avoid searching for, or producing, responsive records. On October 20, the plaintiffs received an acknowledgment from DHS regarding the appeal, but did not receive any other response or correspondence. 

<b>FBI</b>
On July 28, 2016, the FBI sent a letter acknowledging receipt of the plaintiffs' request. Unlike DHS, the FBI granted the plaintiffs' request for expedited processing, however, it did not indicate whether processing had begun or when it would be complete. On September 20, 2016, the plaintiffs sent the FBI a letter requesting that the FBI notify them of when to expect to receive documents responsive to their request, but the FBI never responded.

An initial pretrial conference was originally set for January 20, 2017, before U.S. District Court Judge William H. Pauley III. After several motions to push back the date of the initial pretrial conference, the conference was held on February 24, 2017. Another status conference was held on April 21, 2017. During this conference, the parties agreed to the discovery schedule of 500 pages per month of responsive documents. 

During discovery, both parties narrowed the requested documents, and prepared to file motions to contest or uphold exemptions. In line with timelines set in a February 9, 2018 scheduling conference, both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment surrounding release of a non-finalized intelligence assessment titled ""(U\\FOUO) Growing Frequency of Race-Related Domestic Terrorist Violence."" On July 9, 2018, Judge William Pauley ruled in favor of the defendants, saying that this document falls under FOIA's exemption 5 for process-related documents. He wrote that, because this document was written by an analyst and an intern, it revealed the processes of how DHS assesses and analyzes intelligence.

With this motion for summary judgment decided and the cooperation of the parties outside of the contested DHS memo, all issues in the case were settled outside of the allocation of attorney fees. With this in mind, after an August 7, 2018 status report, Judge Pauley filed an order to partially dismiss the case, closing all claims outside of attorney fees.

The case was briefly stayed in late 2018 and early 2019 due to the U.S. federal government shutdown. On March 12, 2019, Judge Pauley received a status report indicating that the parties reached a settlement on attorney fees. He ordered dismissal on April 11 and published the terms of the agreement; the FBI would pay $12,527.11, the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) would pay $1,742.81, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) would pay $11,655.40, and DHS Intelligence and Analysis would pay $11,655.40 to the plaintiffs.

EE-CA-0348,"On July 12, 2012, three African-American former store-management employees of Wet Seal who had been terminated filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs were represented the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and private counsel, and alleged that Wet Seal, Inc., and related corporations, which sell women's clothing in Wet Seal and Arden B. retail stores., had engaged in racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. The plaintiffs filed the retaliation claims on their own behalf and the discrimination claims as a class action on behalf of black current or former store-management employees.  The complaint sought injunctive relief, including reinstatement and monetary relief in the form of back pay, front pay, attorneys' fees, punitive damages, and compensation for emotional distress.

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant discriminated against black employees in hiring, pay, promotion, and discipline, in comparison to similarly situated white employees. Plaintiffs further argued that senior level company management discriminated against black employees by firing them on account of their race and without cause. Senior-level management had pursued a racially discriminatory brand image of white women, preferably with blond hair and blue eyes, especially in markets with a greater percentage of white clientele, by instructing various levels of management to ""diversify"" stores with largely black employees by hiring more white employees and firing black employees. The plaintiffs claimed that their difficulty in obtaining subsequent employment was due to retaliation for resisting the defendant's discriminatory policies, alleging that the defendant had failed to provide fair references, and in one case, even failed to verify employment.

On Jan. 9, 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, that among other amendments, added another named plaintiff and new claims: a claim for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e) and claims for retaliation and hostile work environment under Title VII on behalf of individual plaintiffs.

On May 8, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a class action settlement, preliminary approval of settlement class, appointment of plaintiffs' counsel as class counsel, approval of notice plan and distribution of notice, and setting schedule for final approval. The settlement addressed both the class action and individual claims. The terms of the proposed settlement provided for a payment of $7.5 million, which included up to $1.8 million for attorney's fees and costs and $120,000 for administration of claims. The proposed settlement included injunctive relief, including diversity, nondiscrimination, and investigation training; development of fair job-related evaluation criteria; and a dedicated phone line for verifying employment.

On June 10, 2013, a motion hearing was held before District Judge Andrew J. Guilford. The court granted class certification, appointed the plaintiffs' counsel as class counsel, and preliminarily approved the Settlement Agreement, and stayed all further litigation not related to the settlement approval process. Regarding the notice plan and distribution of notice, the court suggested several changes at the hearing that the parties adopted. On June 12, 2013, Judge Guilford signed the order, which included the following deadlines: class counsel was to file a motion for final approval of the settlement and Settlement Agreement by Oct. 18, 2013, and class counsel was to file a reply to any objection from class members no later than Nov. 11, 2013.

On Nov. 18, 2013, a final approval hearing was held. On Dec. 9, 2013, the court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement. The court awarded a total of $1,729,037.80 to class counsel, which included attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for work performed to date as well as future monitoring and enforcement through the three-year term of the settlement. The court also granted in part the fee application by the plaintiffs' original attorney - who had been terminated from the plaintiffs' litigation team on July 3, 2012, and had disputed the terms of the settlement agreement - and found that she was entitled to a total fee award of $70,962.20.

Over the 36 months of monitoring required by the settlement, the defendant filed periodic Monitor's Certificates of Compliance, in which the Monitor, the defendant's Vice President and Corporate Controller, certified to the court the status of the defendant's implementation of its programmatic initiatives with the Settlement Agreement. In the Dec. 11, 2014, Certificate of Compliance, the Monitor stated that it was satisfied that the defendant was complying with the Settlement Agreement.

Instead, Cogdell learned that WET SEAL had taken no steps to\n\n7 address employee concerns about racial discrimination by management when she\n\n8 was approached, the same day, by African-American employees of WET SEAL\n\n9 who had overheard Bachman\'s comments about Cogdell to the District Manager\n\n10 and had received no follow up from WET SEAL about discrimination and racism in\n\n11 the workplace.\n\n12\n\n59.

ED-SD-0002,"Plaintiffs, minor students, filed this class action lawsuit on March 27, 2006, against Winner School District and three of its administrators in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota. Plaintiffs, who were Native American, alleged that employees of the School District engaged in a pattern or practice of intentional racial discrimination with the purpose of pushing Native American students out of the school system. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the School District disciplinary practices targeted Native American students by disciplining them more often and more harshly than other students, referring them to law enforcement for minor infractions, and coercing criminal confessions out of them. They also alleged that teachers and administrators tolerated and fostered a racially hostile school environment by allowing racial name-calling and bullying to occur and treating Native American parents with disrespect. As a result, Native American students were less likely to complete high school and felt demoralized at school. 

Represented by the ACLU and the Rosebud Sioux Attorney General's Office, plaintiffs brought claims under the Fifth Amendment, the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. Plaintiffs also asked the court to certify as a class all Native American students who were or would be enrolled in Winner School District's middle and high schools.

On April 28, 2006, plaintiffs submitted a motion for class certification. The parties began the discovery process in June. On October 20, 2006, Judge Charles B. Kornmann issued an order granting class certification.

After a series of mediation sessions, the parties settled and filed a proposed Settlement Agreement on May 30, 2007. A court-enforceable Consent Decree was entered by Judge Kornmann on December 10, 2007. The terms of the Consent Decree prohibited defendants from requiring any student to make a written statement (""affidavit"") that could be used against him or her in legal proceedings. The Decree also required defendants to immediately notify parents after deciding to refer a student to law enforcement and to notify students of their legal right to remain silent in such a case; train School District employees on proper disciplinary procedures and the constitutional rights of students; obtain an independent expert to assist with the development of disciplinary matrices; keep accurate records of disciplinary incidents; conduct evaluations of students subjected to discipline three or more times over the course of a year; hire a Native American ombudsperson; train teachers on American Indian education and educational equity; increase its number of Native American employees; and take several other measures designed to eliminate racial discimination and create an inclusive environment for Native American students and families. Defendants were also ordered to find and appoint a Monitor to oversee and report on the implementation of the Consent Decree.

The court maintained jurisdiction for enforcement purposes. The Decree was to stay in effect until defendants had achieved and maintained compliance for four years. Finally, it awarded plaintiffs $100,000 in attorneys' fees and costs. 

The first and second progress reports, filed in June and September 2008, indicated that defendants had made progress in all areas. Among other things, they had hired more Native American staff members, developed anti-bullying programming, and developed a disciplinary matrix. 

On January 8, 2014, the parties proposed an Amended Consent Decree. The court granted the Amended Decree on April 28, 2014. The new agreement was very similar to the original, but required that, if the School District reached all outcome measures within the following two years, it would be released from the Agreement. If some measures were not reached within that time, the District would be formally released from having to reach those outcomes but would be required to continue a good-faith effort to do so for the following two years. 

On May 31, 2017, the parties jointly filed a motion to terminate the Consent Decree after finding that defendants had met all of their obligations. Judge Kornmann formally terminated the Decree on June 6, 2017.

Plaintiff Sam Antoine is 15 years old and enrolled in the 9th grade at the Winner High School. He is a member of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe. He appears in this action by and through his legal guardian, Rose Mendoza. She appears in this action by and through her mother, Donna Eisenbraun.\n17. He would return to the Winner School District if it changed its disciplinary policies and practices.\n21. Defendant Brian Naasz is Principal of the Winner Middle School. Together with Defendant Fisher and Defendant Naasz, he has ""disciplinary authority over all students while the students are in the school or participating in or attending school sponsored activities whether on or off school premises."" According to the website schooltree.com, the Winner School District currently enrolls approximately 980 students, 19% ofwhom are Native American. When students and parents report these incidents to Defendants, Defendants make little effort to stop them. In August 2002, the District cancelled bus service to ""Indian housing,"" the neighborhood where most Native Americans reside, 1.5 miles from the Winner Middle and High Schools. Students wishing to transfer are often forced to leave their families behind and board at their new schools. Both of these children were sent to a juvenile detention or correctional facility.\n79. While one in five 9th grade students are Native American, only one in twenty 12th grade students are Native American.\n80. During the 2001-2002 school year, the most recent year for which statistics are available, only two (2) Native American students graduated from Winner High School; during the prior year, four (4) graduated.\n81. Another Native American student, acting out in class with a pencil in his hand, stabbed Richard in the stomach, breaking the skin. In February 2004, the charges against Richard were dismissed. Charles, 14 years old at the time, believed that he had no choice but to comply. In March 2001, five months after the initial confrontation, Charles\' family was served with a Delinquency Petition charging Charles with Simple Assault and Disorderly Conduct. Upon learning of the fight, Defendant Principal Naasz contacted the Winner City Police Department to request the arrest and prosecution of the two Native American girls, but not the Caucasian girl. Prior to this incident, Mindi had had no contact with the juvenile justice system.\n117. He was suspended twice for fighting with a Caucasian student who purposefully pushed him. Discouraged by his treatment at school, Jessie stopped going to class during parts of the 2005-06 school year. Principal Naasz then called Jesse\'s mother, Joanne, and informed her that if Jesse were ""insubordinate"" again, he would file a Child in Need of Supervision petition against Jesse in juvenile court.\nF.

The police officers drove John to the police station in their car\n\nwith John\'s mother following in her car.\n\n149. He did not seek the arrest or prosecution of the other child.\n154. After contacting the police, Defendant Naasz asked Josie to draft and sign an affidavit stating that she had hit the other student. After she completed the affidavit, Defendant Naasz notarized it.\n156. Defendant Naasz made no effort to contact Josie\'s mother to inform her that her child was being arrested.\n157. Upon learning of the incident, Defendant Naasz summoned the Winner Police Department and requested that Taylor be arrested and prosecuted with criminal misconduct but not the Caucasian student. Defendant Naasz did not refer the Caucasian student to law enforcement. Paragraphs one through 172 are incorporated herein by reference the same as though pleaded in full.

IM-NY-0071,"On September 25, 2019, the State of New York and the Kings County District Attorney filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs challenged the federal government’s new directive authorizing civil immigration arrests in and around New York State courthouses (“the Directive”). The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the Directive violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Tenth Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Jed S. Rakoff. 

In their complaint, the plaintiffs stated that prior to a January 2018 ICE directive addressing “Civil Immigration Enforcement Actions Inside Courthouses,” there was a longstanding practice of avoiding civil immigration arrests in and around state courthouses. And, because New York recognizes a common-law privilege against civil arrests in, or while traveling to or from, courthouses, the plaintiffs argued that the Directive, which generally authorizes such arrests, violates the APA by exceeding ICE’s statutory authority. The plaintiffs also claimed that the Directive is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA because it was issued absent adequate justification or explanation. 

Next, the plaintiffs alleged that implementation of the Directive disrupts the effective functioning of the State’s court system, deters victims and witnesses from assisting law enforcement and vindicating their rights, hinders criminal prosecution, and undermines public safety. The plaintiffs also noted that ICE enforcement actions at New York State courthouses had “skyrocketed” since the Directive was issued, and that such enforcement had significantly chilled participation in the courts. Thus, the plaintiffs argued that the Directive violates the Tenth Amendment by impermissibly interfering with New York’s right to form its own government by disrupting state court operations and impeding criminal prosecutions. 

On October 23, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The defendants claimed that the Directive is unreviewable under the APA, there is no federal common-law immunity from immigration enforcement for those who are subject to ICE arrest, and that the Directive does not implicate the Tenth Amendment because it does not command or compel state actors to take any action.

On December 19, 2019, the district court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss with respect to all of the plaintiffs’ claims for relief. First, Judge Rakoff found that the Directive was final agency action subject to judicial review. Next, he held that the common-law privilege against civil courthouse arrests applies to immigration arrests, and has not been displaced by federal immigration law. Finally, he found that the facts presented demonstrate that ICE has commandeered state and local judges and court officials not to take action in response to ICE courthouse arrests, even when such arrests cause great disruption and state agents would therefore normally intervene. 431 F.Supp.3d 377.

The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on March 13, 2020. The motion was accompanied by three amicus briefs: one from former nominee to be U.S. Attorney General for Civil Rights and Commissioner of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Debo Adegbile, another from Harvard Law Professor Nikolas Bowie, and a third from the New York Bar Association.

Judge Rakoff granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on June 10, 2020. He held that the Immigration and Nationality Act incorporated the English common law rule preventing service and arrest on people in or traveling to a courthouse. He also ruled that the policy change violated the APA's arbitrary and capricious review standard. He was not persuaded by the defendants' arguments that executive orders and policy directives from DHS effectively mandated that arrests must be carried out in courthouses because the orders mandated no such thing. In granting the summary judgment motion, Judge Rakoff also granted the motion for declaratory and injunctive relief and enjoined ICE from carrying out any civil arrests in New York courthouses. 2020 WL 3067715.

On August 7, 2020, the defendants appealed to the Second Circuit. As of December 23, 2020, the appeal is pending.","Filing Fee $ 400.00,\n\n\x0c09/25/2019 09/25/2019 09/25/2019\n09/25/2019 09/25/2019 09/25/2019 09/25/2019 09/26/2019\n\nReceipt Number ANYSDC-17659362)Document filed by State of New York, Eric Gonzalez.

Redacted Transcript Deadline set for 7/6/2020. Congress’s authorization for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (“DHS”), of which ICE is a part, to conduct civil arrests under the INA must be interpreted against the centuries-old common-law privilege against civil arrests in and around courthouses—a privilege that has been recognized since fifteenth-century England as essential to protecting courts’ ability to function properly. Defendants are United States agencies or officers sued in their official capacities. Defendant Matthew T. Albence is the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. He is sued in his official capacity.\nALLEGATIONS I. The New York State court system.\n23. In April 2018, Governor Cuomo issued Executive Order No. 170.1, limiting federal immigration arrests in state facilities within executive control. The court officer informed him that he would have to make the arrest outside the courthouse. In April 2019, two ICE officers informed a court officer that they were waiting outside the building to take an individual into custody outside of the Westchester County Courthouse. Two other plainclothes agents and a court officer blocked him from his attorney. Minutes before the hearing, ICE arrested him for a civil immigration violation.

Grier, 66 N.Y. 124, 125 (1876); In re Kimball, 14 F. Cas. But the INA does not speak directly to the common law privilege against civil courthouse arrests.\n115. Congress is presumed to retain such long-established common-law principles unless it expressly provides otherwise. Id.1\nIn response to the Executive Order and the Directive, civil arrests by ICE officers in and around New York state courthouses have, as noted, dramatically increased. Robinson v. Overseas Military Sales Corp., 21 F.3d 502, 507 (2d Cir. Citizens to Preserve Overton Park, Inc. v. Volpe, 401 U.S. 402, 410 (1971) (emphasis supplied). But under a ""pragmatic"" view of finality, Abbott Labs., Rep. at 987 (""To permit\n\narrest to be made in the Court would give occasion to perpetual\n\ntumults .\n\n.""). It thus served, in either case, to e~able\n\ncourts to function properly. See Parker, 136 N.Y. at 589 (""It is not simply a personal privilege, but it is also the privilege of the court, and is deemed necessary for the maintenance of its authority and dignity and in order to promote the due and efficient administration of justice. This reason, more than any other, compels the Court to find that, as a matter of New York law, aliens are privileged from immigration arrest while present at courthouses and during their necessary coming and going theiefrom.\nOf course, the ICE agents conducting these arrests act under authority of federal law, not New York law.

The City Bar has a profound interest in ensuring equal access to courts in New York State and New York City.1\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT When ICE officers conduct arrests in and around New York State courthouses, they impede equal access to courts, violate the principles of federalism enshrined in the United States and New York State constitutions, interfere with the fair and efficient administration of justice, and create a chilling effect among immigrants attempting to access the courts. Due process is nowhere more important than in criminal court where a defendant must be given the chance to appear in court and confront the witnesses against her. 27 See Beth Fertig, Outcry After Immigration Agents Seen at Queens Human Trafficking Court, WNYC (June 16, 2017), https://www.wnyc.org/story/outcry-after-immigration-agents-cometrafficking-victim-queens-courthouse/; Tory Johnson, Immigration Arrests at Courthouses Are Under Fire From State Officials, IMMIGRATION IMPACT, (Sept. 28, 2017), https://immigrationimpact.com/2017/09/28/immigration-arrests-at-courthouses-fire-stateofficials/#.XmvwdZNKiu4. Instead, the agency stayed its course, failing to offer a rational connection between the facts on the ground and their enforcement practices.\nCONCLUSION For the foregoing reasons, amicus curiae respectfully requests that the Court grant Plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment.\n37 See, e.g., New York et al. For the following reasons, the Court rules in plaintiffs’ favor on both claims and grants the requested relief.\nBACKGROUND In their complaint filed on September 25, 2019, plaintiffs the State of New York and the Kings County District Attorney sought injunctive and declaratory relief from ICE’s policy of conducting civil immigration arrests of aliens at New York state\n2\n\n\x0cCase 1:19-cv-08876-JSR Document 109 Filed 06/10/20 Page 3 of 24\ncourthouses. The\nstriking increase from 2016 to 2017 further confirms that ICE\neffectively expanded its courthouse arrest policy in early 2017\nin response to the Executive Order (and the 2017 Implementing\nMemo), and that the Directive, promulgated in 2018, simply\nmemorialized the policy and practices that had already been put\nin place the preceding year.\n9 These records include I-213 arrest reports and ICE Field Operation Worksheets, as well as Unusual Occurrence Reports produced by the New York state courts. But none persuades the Court to abandon its earlier conclusion. The Directive also instructs ICE officers to avoid arrests in public areas of the courthouse and in areas dedicated to non-criminal proceedings.\nBut while the administrative record produced by defendants provides an explanation for this modest narrowing, it says nothing about the reasons for the broad change in post-2016 policy that the Directive largely adopts. 2018) (citing SEC v. Chenery Corp. (Chenery I), 318 U.S. 80, 94 (1943) (“[I]f the [agency] action is based upon a determination of law as to which the reviewing authority of the courts does come into play, an order may not stand if the agency has misconceived the law.",0.6901,0.3118,0.4295,0.2328,0.1051,0.1448,0.2485,0.1123,0.1547
PA-CA-0002,"On September 9, 2014, the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), along with several of its members who had been discriminated against by Uber drivers because of their service animals, filed this lawsuit in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California. They sued Uber under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 12811 et seq.), the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code §§ 51 & 52), and the California Disabled Persons Act (California Civil Code §§ 54-54.3). Represented by Disability Rights Advocates and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages for the named plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs accused Uber drivers of, among other things, refusing to provide service to people with service dogs, mistreating the dogs and their owners, unfairly giving them negative feedback scores, and charging inappropriate cancellation fees. They alleged that Uber’s response to complaints about driver behavior was opaque and insufficient: Uber generally failed to notify service dog owners of whether the company had investigated complaints, and denied responsibility for drivers’ behavior.

On October 22, 2014, Uber filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the NFB and the named plaintiffs all lacked standing to sue under both state and federal law. Uber also argued that even if the plaintiffs had standing, Uber wasn’t a public accommodation and thus wasn’t covered by Title III of the ADA. 

The United States Department of Justice issued a statement of interest on December 23, 2014. It asked the court to consider the Department of Transportation’s Title III regulations, which are granted considerable weight since the DOT is responsible for implementing the ADA. DOT regulations state that Title III applies to any “demand-responsive” service that doesn’t operate on a fixed route, and that private entities cannot “contract away” any responsibilities under the ADA. 49 C.F.R. § 37.3; 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. D § 37.23. The DOT regulations further require entities covered by Title III to permit service animals to accompany their owners into vehicles, and requires entities to apply eligibility criteria that don’t screen disabled people out, unless doing so would make it impossible to provide the service. 49 C.F.R. § 37.167(d); 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(1); 49 C.F.R. § 37.5(f). The regulations also require positive action on the part of private entities to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to avoid discrimination (except when those modifications would fundamentally alter the service), and to ensure that their personnel are trained to properly assist disabled individuals in a respectful and courteous way, with appropriate attention to the difference among individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(2)(A); 49 C.F.R. § 37.173. 

On April 17, 2015, the court denied Uber’s motion to dismiss. It found that even if not all Uber drivers discriminated against blind people with service animals, discrimination by some drivers was sufficient injury for the plaintiffs to bring suit. The court also found that the NFB could sue even if some of its members had signed binding arbitration agreements with Uber, because many of its members had not. The court didn’t directly respond to the DOJ’s statement of interest, finding instead that since there was a possibility that Uber was covered by the ADA and the California statutes, the parties should have the opportunity to litigate the question. 103 F. Supp. 3d 1073.

On December 6, 2016, the court approved a settlement agreement. Uber agreed to: <ul><li>Require its drivers to provide service to blind people with service animals<li>Modify its cleaning fee policy for messes caused by service animals<li>Make it easier for service animal owners to file complaints<li>Implement enhanced procedures for investigating complaints<li>Dismiss drivers receiving multiple plausible complaints<li>Submit to third-party monitoring<li>Pay the NFB $75,000 per year for three years<li>Pay a lump sum of $45,000 for distribution among the named plaintiffs<li>Pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs</ul>Uber also agreed to a class certification for purposes of the settlement, extending to all blind people with service animals who had used, attempted to use, or been deterred from attempting to use transportation through the Uber app.

The settlement was to last for a default period of 3½ years. Retired Judge Margaret A. Nagle was appointed as a neutral monitor to oversee compliance. The monitor had authority to extend the agreement by 1½ years if Uber failed to substantially comply with the terms of the agreement in the second or third year. Any disputes related to the monitor would first be referred to an arbitrator, and if that failed, the court would exercise jurisdiction.

Two weeks following the approval of the settlement agreement, on December 15, 2016, the court awarded the plaintiffs $2,485,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs. Uber appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which dismissed the appeal with prejudice on March 7, 2017. 

On November 8, 2019, the court ordered Uber to pay the plaintiffs a total of $313,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in monitoring and enforcing the agreement. 

On July 15, 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to modify the settlement. As of July 20, 2020, the court’s jurisdiction over the settlement agreement is ongoing.","['Case3:14-cv-04086-NC Document1 Filed09/09/14 Page1 of 25\n\nDISABILITY RIGHTS ADVOCATES 2001 CENTER STREET, FOURTH FLOOR BERKELEY, CALIFORNIA 94704-1204\n(510) 665-8644\n\n1 LAURENCE PARADIS (CA BAR NO.

The UberX driver ignored her plea and refused to let her service animal enter the vehicle.\n\n15 The UberX driver told her that he was leaving for his next passenger. In connection with Mr. Rueda’s travels to and from that convention, at least\n\n13 two different UberX drivers refused to transport him because of his service animal. A driver named Jesus accepted his trip request and transported him without\n\n27 incident.

DR-CO-0001,"Two minors and their mother and their mother sued the Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles.  Colorado law required that a teenager log a certain amount of hours driving under the supervision of a licensed parent or guardian. Because the mother is blind, she was unable to supervise her daughters' driving.  The girls' father did not have custody and lived out of state, leaving no qualified adult to supervise them in completeing the requirements for a driver's license.	

The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants failed to make a reasonable modification of Colorado law, which violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.

The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the defendants had violated the federal statutes, an injunction against the defendants' further discrimination, monetary compensation, attorney's fees and costs, and other equitable relief.

Under Colorado law, individuals who are 16 can apply for a minor's driver's license provided they have logged 50 hours of driving experience with their learner's permit, under the supervision of a qualified adult. C.R.S. §§ 42-2-104(1)(c) & 106(1)(a). Another statute, C.R.S. § 42-2-106(b) (2004), restricts minors with learners' permits to driving under the supervision of ""a parent, stepparent, or guardian with a valid driver's license.""

On May 27, 2005, the legislature amended § 42-2-106(b) (2004) to include grandparents with powers of attorney as acceptable supervisory drivers, but the mother stated she would not relinquish her parental rights to her daughters' grandfather. Thus again, under the amended statute there was no eligible driver for supervision.  On August 10, 2005 the DMV allowed the mother to sign a ""designation"" giving the grandfather permission to supervise but indicating that she was ""in no way relinquishing any parental rights.""

On October 17, 2005, in an unpublished order, the District Court dismissed the individual claims of the minor named plaintiffs because they were not themselves disabled. Although they had an association with their mother, who is disabled, there was no employment relationship with the defendant, which is required for ""associational disability"" claims. The court permitted the organizational plaintiffs and the mother to continue the lawsuit.

On January 04, 2006, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider its previous opinion and reinstated the minors as named plaintiffs. The court held that a party, although not herself disabled, may assert claims under Title II of the ADA and under the Rehabilitation Act for discrimination against a disabled person that directly injures that party. 

The older daughter obtained her driver's license on November 14, 2005, two months after she turned 16.  She claimed compensatory damages because of the two-month delay and because she had not been able to experience driving under different road conditions over the previous year, having compressed her entire learning experience into two months. 

On July 1, 2006, the legislature further amended the statute to allow the appointment of an alternate permit supervisor who holds a valid Colorado driver's license and is twenty-one years or older, without any relinquishing of parental rights or power of attorney over the child. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs continued the lawsuit.

On May 14, 2007, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in an unpublished opinion, 2007 WL 1430103. The court found that after the amended statute mooted the claims for equitable relief, the only remaining claim was for compensatory damages under Section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794. However, because the plaintiffs could not prove that the defendants acted intentionally -- i.e. with ""deliberate indifference to the strong likelihood that pursuit of its questioned policies will likely result in a violation of federally protected rights,"" they could not sustain a claim for damages. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider in an unpublished opinion on June 21, 2007.	

<b>Appeal</b>

In a published opinion on April 15, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court order granting summary judgment to the defendants. Barber v. Colorado, Dept. of Revenue, 562 F.3d 1222 (9th Cir. 2009). The Ninth Circuit agreed that the plaintiffs failed to prove intent as the Rehabilitation Act required. Especially relevant were the facts that the DMV offered reasonable accommodation by allowing the mother to designate the grandfather as a supervisor and that the DMV was aware the state legislature was progressing towards amendment. The Court of Appeals' mandate on is the final entry on the district court docket, on  May 7, 2009.

","['IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO\nCivil Action No. With respect to the allegations contained in paragraph 26 of the Amended Complaint, Defendants state that the statute speaks for itself, and to the extent that any allegation in paragraph 26 differs from or is inconsistent with the statute, the allegation is denied.\n27. Defendants deny the allegations contained in paragraph 80 of the Amended Complaint.\n81. 1998).\nThe statute of which Plaintiffs complain is facially neutral. 1660, 75 L.Ed.2d 675 (1983) (internal quotation marks and citations omitted).\nIn addition to these constitutional limitations, there are also three prudential limitations on standing: (1) generally, there is no jurisdiction over ""generalized grievances"" shared by all or a large class of citizens; (2) a plaintiff must assert his or her own legal rights and cannot rest his or her claim to relief on the legal rights of third parties. Duvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1139 (9th Cir. 1996) (failure to provide accommodations constitutes intentional discrimination). As such, even if the Court should agree that the change in the statutory language moots the claims for prospective relief, the claims of Marcia and Julianna Barber for compensatory damages under the RA are not affected by this argument.\n8(...continued) include parents who are blind and their children, who are likely to encounter the same discrimination encountered by the Barbers.” In such instances the minor driver may obtain driving experience before his or her 16th birthday with an approved driver education instructor who holds a valid driver’s license, through assignment by the parent of a limited guardianship for purposes of driver’s education only, or through a grandparent (after July 1, 2005).

Trafficante, 409 U.S. at 20708 (quoting 42 U.S.C. § 3610 (1972)).\nThe remedial provisions of Title II and the Rehabilitation Act are similarly broad (see Motion to Reconsider at 7-8), and thus permit claims by any plaintiff -- including a plaintiff without a disability -- who was injured by conduct recognized to constitute discrimination under the statutes. All of Marcia Barber’s interactions with Mr. Tool were pleasant and professional. Exhibit C, Deposition of Marcia Barber at p. 45, ll. Exhibit C Marcia Barber Deposition at p. 46, ll. At that point Marcia Barber advised Suthers that amendment of the statute was already in the works. ( Mr. Suthers advised Marcia Barber that he was certain that he could assist her in solving her immediate situation until the law was changed. ( Specifically, Mr. Suthers discussed with Marcia Barber the possibility of signing or drafting some sort of document or limited delegation of authority that would comply with the spirit of the statute to allow Marcia Barber’s father to supervise the driving until such time as the statute was amended.

( Both letters expressly informed Ms. Barber that she would have to assign full guardianship -“full parental authority,” in the words of one of the letters (JA 173) -- in order to permit someone else to supervise Julianna’s driving practice.\nThe facts discussed in this Section III demonstrate that Plaintiffs established a claim for intentional violation of Section 504, and that summary judgment was\n-24-\n\n\x0cthus improper. The exception created by the district court here is just the sort of “selective abdication” that would hobble the enforcement of Section 504.\nD. There Is No Good Faith Exception to the Damages Remedy under Section 504.\nThe district court’s conclusion that the Agency Defendants did not intentionally discriminate appears to stem from the Agency Defendants’ primary argument against deliberate indifference: that they were nice people who felt bad about Ms. Barber’s situation and were trying to be helpful by cooperating in amending the statute. ( Because this did not provide meaningful access, it was not a reasonable accommodation.\nA reasonable accommodation must provide meaningful access to the programs and activities of a recipient. See, e.g., Tool Letter (JA 199) (quoting Black’s Law Dictionary definition of “guardian” as a person\n-40-\n\n\x0c“lawfully invested with the power, and charged with the duty, of taking care of the\nperson and managing the property and rights of another person”); Dodd Letter (JA\n173) (stating that the Agency Defendants would only permit someone with “full\nparental authority” to supervise Julianna’s driving).)

City of Claremore, 411 F.Supp. However, because he was very interested in finding a solution he sought guidance from the Colorado Attorney General' s Office and further facilitated the amendments to the statute at issue to accommodate all parents who do not have a driver' s license. ( Mr. Tool, as the head of the Department, relied on that advice to tell Ms. Barber that a grandfather was not a guardian per se. ( Neither of these letters is mentioned or cited anywhere in the Answer Brief.\nA letter from the Attorney General’s office after the phone call again insisted that only a driver with “full parental authority” could supervise Julianna’s driving. ( By denying Ms. Barber’s request in October, 2004, and instead merely cooperating in an effort to amend the statute that did not bear fruit until May, 2005,3 the Agency Defendants cut that year of practice time to at most three months.\n3 The Barbers assert that the statute as amended still required Ms. Barber to assign away legal rights through a step -- signing a power of attorney -that was not required of non-disabled parents. To the contrary, granting the requested accommodation would have best served the State’s safety concerns by ensuring that Julianna got the maximum possible driving practice.\nB. It Is Irrelevant That Non-Disabled Parents Without Licenses May Also Be Affected by this Statute.\nDefendants argue that because Ms. Barber “faced the same obstacle that any non-disabled unlicensed parent faced,” she did not encounter discrimination “‘solely’ because of her disability,” as prohibited by Section 504. In a letter to Marcia Barber dated November 22, 2004, Mr. Tool reported that the State Attorney General\'s Office had informed him that the DMV could not permit Julianna\'s grandfather to supervise her driving, unless he was ""a legally appointed guardian."" A `complete failure of proof concerning an essential element of the nonmoving party\'s case necessarily renders all other facts immaterial.\'"" Bruner v.

Essentially, the Barbers claim that the DMV disregarded its duties under § 504 in adhering to the Colorado licensing statute, thus triggering a conflict with the Supremacy Clause.\nIt is well established that ""Congress has the power to preempt state law.""",0.6697,0.3158,0.4292,0.166,0.0782,0.1063,0.2069,0.0976,0.1326
JI-OH-0011,"On November 23, 2014, two African-American teenage males filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio under 42 U.S.C. §1983 against the Hamilton County Juvenile Detention Center and Hamilton County, Ohio. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest counsel, sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. They requested that the Court enjoin the Juvenile Court from arresting and detaining youth without conducting a probable cause hearing. The plaintiffs claimed that the detention of youth after 48 hours without providing a probable cause hearing violates their right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The first plaintiff was arrested at school on September 12, 2014, on a charge of aggravated robbery. Based on the victim's description, a warrant was issued, and the plaintiff was taken into custody at the Hamilton County Detention Center. He was in isolation for two days. The Juvenile Court did not make a probable cause determination prior to issuing a warrant for the first plaintiff, nor within 48 hours of detention. The case was continued on October 6, 2014, for a probable cause hearing, which never happened. S.W. had a trial on October 10, 2014, where the case was dismissed on the merits. Although S.W. was released, he never received a probable cause hearing at arrest or during his detention. 

The second plaintiff was arrested outside his home on July 8, 2014, by Cincinnati police officers, who did not present an arrest warrant. He was taken to the local police station, interrogated for alleged involvement in a robbery, and taken to the Hamilton County Detention Center on July 9, 2014. He remained incarcerated at the Detention Center from July 8 to July 23, during which time no probable cause determinations in his case occurred. 

On December 10, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Although a preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for March 24, 2015, the parties began settlement negotiations in February 2015 and the hearing was changed to a status conference on settlement progress.

On September 29, 2015, the parties reached an agreement and Judge Susan Dlott approved and adopted an agreed order of dismissal without prejudice. The Hamilton County Juvenile Court agreed to plan, design, and implement a best practice model for processing complaints, issuing arrest warrants, making probable cause determinations, and conducting detention hearings. This included revisions to Rule 38 of the Rules of Practice for Hamilton County Juvenile Court. Additionally, the juvenile court agreed create a new training curriculum to assist clerks in making probable cause determinations. The Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney also agreed to assign an assistant prosecuting attorney to attend detention hearings at the Youth Center.
The case is presumably closed.","Attachments: # 1 Civil Cover Sheet, # 2 Class Complaint, # 3 Summons Form, # 4 Summons Form, # 5 Summons Form, # 6 Plaintiffs' Motion to Proceed with Initials, # 7 Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction, # 8 Exhibit Ex.

( As a minor child he brings this action by and through his aunt and legal guardian, Pamela Matthews. Plaintiff L.D. is a 16-year-old African-American male who resides in Hamilton County, Ohio. Defendant John M. Williams is and was at all times relevant to this action the duly elected Administrative Judge of the Juvenile Court. Defendant Hamilton County is sued through the Hamilton County Board of County Commissioners who are named only in their official capacity pursuant to O.R.C. §305.12. Defendant is a ""person"" under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and at all times relevant to this case acted under color of law.\nIV. Attorneys serving as co-counsel are also civil rights attorneys who have extensive experience representing youths in federal class action suits. Defendant Dwayne Bowman is the Superintendent of the Detention Center. Arrest Warrants and Detention Intake Procedures Lack Procedural Protections 24. According to the Juvenile Court\'s Annual Report, the Detention Center processed 6,074 intakes for children presented to detention under arrest in 2013. Constance Murdock is listed on the Juvenile Court\'s website as Executive Director of Case Management and Docketing.\n48. The Juvenile Court did not make a probable cause determination prior to issuing an arrest warrant for S.W. nor within 48 hours of his admission to the Detention Center.\n52. S.W. had a trial on October 10,2014, at which time the case was dismissed on the merits. He was released from detention that same day.\n55. He was confused and scared that no one would believe that he was innocent.\n56. L.D. was arrested by Cincinnati Police officers, without an arrest warrant, at 7:45 p.m. on July 8, 2013 near his home. When L.D.\'s mother protested the arrest of her son with no warrant, officers arrested her for ""obstructing official business. He denied any involvement in the alleged incident. There is no indication from court documents that a probable cause determination was made in his case during that time.\n63. On July 23, 2013, L.D. was released with an electronic monitoring ankle bracelet and placed on house arrest. Because the Juvenile Court does not make probable cause findings within 48 hours of detention as constitutionally required, each of the children annually arrested and detained at the Detention Center are at risk of the same due process deprivations.\nDisparate Impact on African-American Children 67. In addition, the RRI for secure detention placement was 1.87-African-American children were 1.87 times more likely than White children to be placed in secure detention.\n72. OJJDP reported that the Juvenile Court\'s RRI for arrests was 9.89 in 2013-AfricanAmerican children were 9.89 times more likely to be arrested than White children. Plaintiff realleges each of the foregoing paragraphs as if fully rewritten here. Both the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Article I,§ 16 of the Ohio Constitution prohibit the government from adversely impacting an individual\'s liberty absent procedural due process. Those children, like Plaintiffs S.W. and L.D. and all those they seek to represent, who are arrested and detained in Hamilton County, Ohio have a liberty interest in remaining free from arrest and detention in the absence of a probable cause finding by a neutral judicial officer. The standard procedures and practices promulgated by the Hamilton County Juvenile Court and Detention Center violate the liberty interests of children by issuing improper warrants,\n15\n\n\x0cCase: 1:14-cv-00896-SJD Doc #: 1-2 Filed: 11/23/14 Page: 16 of 19 PAGEID #: 24\nauthorizing the arrest and detention of children without any procedural safeguards or due process whatsoever.\n81. Defendants Williams, Bowman, and Hamilton County are charged with the duty to create and enforce the policies and practices of the Hamilton County Juvenile Court and Detention Center. These children will continue to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of relief.\n16\n\n\x0cCase: 1:14-cv-00896-SJD Doc #: 1-2 Filed: 11/23/14 Page: 17 of 19 PAGEID #: 25\nClaim Two: Violation of Fonrth Amendment Rights 85. In light of these principles, the policies, practices, and customs of the Hamilton County Juvenile Court and Detention Center, the arrest and detention ofjuveniles absent a probable cause determination that a delinquent act was committed violates the Fourth Amendment. 0081982) Trial Attorney for Plaintiffs KIMBERLY TANDY (Ohio BarNo.",0.7357,0.2998,0.426,0.2892,0.1177,0.1673,0.293,0.1194,0.1696
PN-AZ-0001,"This lawsuit was the result of an investigation launched by the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2009 into the alleged targeting and unconstitutional treatment of Latinos by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. (The DOJ's initial inquiry apparently started in 2008, but the formal investigation opened with notice to the Sheriff's Office in March 2009.)

The Sheriff's Office declined to cooperate in the investigation, leading the DOJ to file a a related lawsuit in September 2010 against Maricopa County under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, seeking to compel the Sheriff's Office to provide the requested information. See <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12019"">PN-AZ-0002 in this Clearinghouse</a>). Maricopa County settled that lawsuit in June 2011, and agreed to cooperate.

(Also, prior to this case, in 2007, a group of plaintiffs had filed a lawsuit, Melendres v. Arpaio, against the County of Maricopa, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio. (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12282"">PN-AZ-0003 in this Clearinghouse</a>). In 2013, the Melendres Court found the MCSO in violation of the Constitution, and entered a permanent injunction forbidding racial profiling.) 

In this matter, DOJ released its findings letter reporting the results of the investigation on December 15, 2011. The letter reported that the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) was engaged in an unconstitutional pattern of policing. The DOJ found that the MSCO profiled Latinos, and unlawfully stoped, detained, and arrested Latinos. The DOJ also found that services in the Maricopa County Jail for people of limited English proficiency were insufficient or nonexistent. The DOJ found that a lack of policy to ensure constitutional policing underscored these problems. 

On May 10, 2012, the DOJ filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 14141 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Maricopa County and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. Specifically, the DOJ's complaint alleged that: <ul><li>(1) the MSCO's policies and practices discriminated against Latino persons;<li>(2) the MSCO targeted Latino workers while enforcing state identity theft laws, resulting in the seizure of Latinos at worksites without reasonable suspicion;<li>(3) the MSCO's discriminatory law enforcements practices violated Title VI;<li>(4) the County's jails discriminated against limited English proficiency Latino prisoners in violation of Title VI; <li>(5) the County and MSCO were violating their Title VI contractual assurances; and <li>(6) the County and MSCO retaliated against persons in Maricopa County on the basis of their protected speech.</li></ul>
The DOJ requested injunctive and declaratory relief to stop Maricopa County's alleged practice of depriving Latino persons of their constitutional rights and to stop discrimination against Latinos in violation of Title VI.

The case was assigned to Chief Judge Roslyn O. Silver. On December 12, 2012, she denied Defendants' motion to dismiss the case, but granted the motion to dismiss the MCSO from the case, ruling the MCSO was not an entity that could sue or be sued.

On September 4, 2014, after lengthy discovery, proceedings were held before Judge Silver in which both parties informed the court that they would file dispositive motions. On October 27, the DOJ filed its motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Defendants were precluded by collateral estoppel from re-litigating the issue of whether the MSCO's traffic stops constituted a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The DOJ claimed that the issue had already been decided against the MSCO in <i>Melendres v. Arpaio</i>, where the MCSO was a defendant. 989 F. Supp. 2d 822 (D. Ariz. 2013) (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12282"">PN-AZ-0003 in this Clearinghouse</a>). On the same day, the Defendants made a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that neither Title VI nor § 14141 authorized this suit against Maricopa County. On June 15, 2015, Judge Silver granted the DOJ's motion with respect to the traffic stops and denied the Defendants' motion.

On July 15, 2015, Judge Silver ordered the parties to file a joint statement setting forth what issues remained for trial. In response, on July 17, the parties filed a joint motion to approve a settlement agreement regarding the second, fourth, and sixth claims for relief from the DOJ's complaint. The MSCO agreed to stop unconstitutionally enforcing state identity theft laws and to develop an anti-retaliation policy. On July 20, the DOJ moved to stay this action until the court in <i>Melendres</i> (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12282"">PN-AZ-0003 in this Clearinghouse</a>), in which the DOJ had recently intervened, found that the Defendants had maintained compliance with an injunction for three years. However, the Defendants argued this was inappropriate because when the DOJ moved to intervene in <i>Melendres</i>, it had represented that it would terminate the overlapping parts of this case if the intervention motion was granted. On September 2, 2015, Judge Silver granted the parties' joint motion to approve the settlement agreement with respect to the issues not covered by <i>Melendres</i>--worksite operations and retaliation--but otherwise dismissed the matter.  

On December 30, 2015, Maricopa County appealed this case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 

Over the next two years, little happened in the case as the parties awaited a decision from the appellate court. 

On May 7, 2018, the Court issued an opinion affirming the judgment. Judge Paul J. Watford held that sheriffs act as final policymakers for their respective counties on law-enforcement matters. Moreover, U.S.C. §12601 imposed liability on a governmental authority whose own official policy caused it to engage in “a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers” that deprived persons of federally protected rights. Because sheriffs are final policymakers for their counties, the policies they adopt are, in fact, the counties' policies. For this reason, Maricopa County should be held liable for their sheriffs' acts. 

On June 21, 2018, Maricopa County filed a petition for panel rehearing and a petition for rehearing <i>en banc</i>, but the request was denied. On October 15, 2018, Maricopa County filed a petition for a <i>writ of certiorari</i> in the United States Supreme Court. Certiorari was denied on March 25, 2019. 139 S.Ct. 1373. 

The parties jointly moved to terminate the settlement on May 9, 2019. The court ordered this termination on May 14, and the case has since been closed.

JC-TX-0020,"On November 15, 2007, an individual who was strip searched after being charged with a petty crime filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Represented by the Texas Civil Rights Project and private counsel, the plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging as unconstitutional Bexar County Detention Center's policy or custom of strip searching misdemeanant arrestees even where they were not suspected of concealing weapons or contraband.

Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that she was arrested for an outstanding traffic warrant and taken to the Bexar County Detention Center, where she was subjected to a strip search upon admission. The plaintiff further alleged that, after being held for two days, she and 25 other pretrial detainees were ordered to change into jail-issued uniforms, at which time she was again strip searched. The plaintiffs allege that detainees were told to manipulate genitalia and sometimes ""squat and cough"" regardless of whether there was reasonable suspicion of contraband or weapons. The plaintiff claimed that the strip searches violated her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights in that they were conducted in the absence of any reasonable suspicion that she was hiding weapons or contraband. To remedy the alleged constitutional violation, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. 

On April 2, 2009, both parties agreed to a consent decree that would provide permanent injunctive relief without further litigation. The decree dictated that the County Detention Center would no longer, absent reasonable suspicion that someone is concealing contraband, engage in the practice of strip searching or visual cavity searching those in their custody who are charged with misdemeanors. The County Detention Center also had to provide the court with an annual report regarding the implementation of the consent decree. Nothing in the consent decree addressed the plaintiff's request for compensatory and punitive damages. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the decree. The decree was signed by Judge Fred Biery of the Western District of Texas. 

On November 16, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The parties continued to engage in discovery and settlement talks to resolve the damages claims. On August 26, 2010, the plaintiffs' submitted a motion of preliminary approval of the class-action settlement. The court preliminarily approved the settlement on October 13, 2010. After a fairness hearing, a final order of approval was granted on January 12, 2011.

The settlement agreement certified a class of plaintiffs composed of all detainees of Bexar County Detention Center between November 2005 and April 2009 who were subjected to strip searches and booked on misdemeanor or other minor charges. Those with felonies were not included. The class also had two subclasses. Subclass I was composed of all detainees not in subclass II, and subclass II included detainees booked on narcotics, shoplifting, and weapons-violation misdemeanors. All members of the class were to receive a pro rata share of the settlement after administrative expenses, attorneys' fees, and other expenses are counted for. 

Attorneys' fees were $900,000 for this case. The court found this reasonable considering the amount of time put in and the complexity of the case. The settlement included $395,000 for the claim administrator, and $15,000 was given to the three class representatives for their work in the lawsuit. The fund was then be used to pay class members. Class members in subclass I could receive up to $1,000, and members of subclass II can receive up to $100. Class members could pay off court fines and fees in Bexar County with their settlement funds, but this was capped at $500 and $50 for the subclasses respectively.

On January 28, 2013, however, the district court dismissed this case, thus vacating and revoking the settlement agreement. In 2012, the Supreme Court decided <i>Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington</i>, holding that jail administrators may require all arrestees committed to the general population of the jail to undergo a no-touch visual strip search, even if the detainees is booked for a minor offense or reasonable suspicion is absent. The plaintiffs, their attorneys, and class members were not required to pay back any fees or funds they were awarded, but the County no longer needed to abide by the consent decree from April 9, 2009, that details how their strip search policy is to be conducted. They were now guided by the decision in <i>Florence</i>.","['Case 5:07-cv-00928-FB Document 1 Filed 11/15/2007 Page 1 of 15\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nSAN ANTONIO DIVISION\n\n2001 NOV 15 \\0: 50\n\nJULIA ANN JACKSON, individually and on behalf of a class of others similarly situated\n\nCLASS ACTION COMPLAINT\n\nPlaintiffs,\n\nv. In addition, such policy and practice does not call for any reasonable suspicion analysis before conducting a strip search. Specifically excluded from the class are Defendant and any and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assignees.\n7. Furthermore, upon information and belief, many members of the class are low-income persons, may not speak English, and likely would have great difficulty in pursuing their rights individually.\n10. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, in that they all had their right to be free from unreasonable searches violated by Detention Officers conducting strip searches absent particularized suspicion. Plaintiff Jackson and all members of the class sustained damages arising out of Defendant\'s course of conduct. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class, and predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the class. P. 23(c)(4).\nFACTS Facts Applicable to the Class Generally 21. The Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution prohibits state officials, such as the Detention Center Corrections Officers, from performing strip searches of arrestees who have been charged with misdemeanors or other minor crimes unless the officer has reasonable suspicion to believe that the arrestee is concealing a weapon or contraband.\n7\n\n\x0cCase 5:07-cv-00928-FB Document 1 Filed 11/15/2007 Page 8 of 15\n22. Plaintiff Julia Ann Jackson was arrested on misdemeanor charges and admitted to the Bexar County Detention Center. Immediately prior to providing Jackson with the Detention Center uniform, a female Corrections Officer required Jackson to submit to a strip search whereby the Officer and another detainee were able to view Jackson while she was in a state of complete undress. Jackson was later released from the Detention Center after she was able to pay bail. Plaintiff Martin Martinez (""Martinez"" or ""Plaintiff Martinez"") is a 45 male who resides in San Antonio, Texas. All members of the class were charged with misdemeanors or violations when placed into the custody of the Detention Center, and all were illegally strip searched in violation of the established law in this judicial circuit.\n13. Plaintiffs\' claims are typical of the claims of the members of the class. In short, the County of Bexar and Detention Center Officers acted on grounds generally applicable to all class members.\n18. Upon information and belief, the County of Bexar and the Bexar County Detention Center have instituted a written and/or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip searching all individuals who enter the custody of the Detention Center and are placed into jail clothing, regardless ofthe nature of their charged crime and without the presence of reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual was concealing a weapon or contraband.\n25.

IM-TX-0027,"By filing a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas on February 6, 2008, which they amended on April 7, 2008, and again on September 16, 2008, nine named plaintiffs brought a class action lawsuit naming, as defendants, the U.S. State Department and the United States.  The plaintiffs alleged that each had been born in the U.S. years earlier, with the births occurring not in a medical facility but typically attended by a midwife who, for some, registered the birth as occurring in the U.S.  Recently, each plaintiff had applied for a U.S. passport.  Rather than adjudicate their applications by granting or denying each a passport, the State Department requested additional proof of U.S. citizenship from each.  After supplying additional proof, the plaintiffs alleged that, usually, the agency did not acknowledge its receipt and, instead, advised the plaintiffs that their applications would be filed ""without further action.""  To the plaintiffs, this kind of stalling non-decision was how the agency avoided legal formalities and approvals required to actually deny a passport application and constituted, effectively, denial.  The plaintiffs' U.S. citizenship assertions were often complicated by their having also been registered in Mexico as having been born there.  Bogus Mexican birth registrations, filed by their parents, typically made the plaintiffs eligible for health benefits or school in that country when, at times, the parents resided there.

Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought to represent a national class consisting of ""all persons who have filed or will in the future file applications for United States passports, in whose cases, on or after April 8, 2003, the defendants did, or will in the future, 'file' or 'close' their applications without formally adjudicating them.""  The plaintiffs alleged that their inability to travel freely, resulting from the effective denial of their passport applications, significantly and unlawfully restricted their liberty.  They sought a declaratory judgment under 8 U.S.C. § 1503 that the named plaintiffs were, in fact, U.S. citizens; a class-wide declaratory judgment that defendants had violated due process by failing to adjudicate and otherwise obstructing the class's applications, and corresponding injunctive relief; a class-wide declaratory judgment that defendants had violated equal protection by treating the class differently from similarly situated U.S. citizens of different race, ethnicity or ancestry, and corresponding injunctive relief; a class-wide declaration that defendants had violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 703, by acting arbitrarily and capriciously, and corresponding injunctive relief; a writ of mandamus compelling the defendants to actually adjudicate the applications and issue the passports; and attorneys' fees and costs. Plaintiffs also initially sought habeas relief, but dropped this cause of action in their second amended complaint.

On October 15, 2008, the defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Over the course of the following six months, several individual plaintiffs obtained their passports and voluntarily dismissed their claims.

On June 26, 2009, the parties informed the District Court that they had come to a agreement. Under the terms of their proposed settlement, the defendants agreed to re-adjudicate the applications of the class without denying them solely because an applicant had been birthed by a midwife on defendants' list of suspected or known birth certificate forgers, and to waive fees if the class member made a request by June 1, 2010. Defendants also agreed to train their employees on re-adjudication under the terms of the settlement, to give notice to the class, and to pay attorneys' fees of $150,000. The Court was to retain only contingent jurisdiction to mediate disputes over the settlement should the other dispute resolution mechanisms listed be exhausted, and the settlement was to last for two years and eleven months.

The parties moved for preliminary approval and class certification for settlement purposes, and the Court (Judge Randy Crane) granted their motion on July 7, 2009.

After hearing objections from individuals who wanted to be covered by the settlement but who had been denied passports and were thus not part of the class, and responses from the parties, who pointed out that the objectors were not bound by the settlement and could thus still bring their own claims, the Court (Judge Crane) gave its final approval to the settlement on August 14, 2009.

(Note that on July 2, 2009, the Court approved the motion of three plaintiffs to sever their individual claims under 8 U.S.C. § 1503 for declarations that they were U.S. citizens, and created the separate case of Castelano v. Rice, No. 7:09-cv-00177, to address these claims. By October 25, 2010, all three plaintiffs had received their passports and dismissed their claims, reserving the right to file future 8 U.S.C. § 1503 claims should the need arise.)

","This is a case about the federal government denying a class of persons their fundamental rights to due process and equal protection, and their right not to be subject to arbitrary and capricious government action, in violation of the United States Constitution and federal law.\n2. Specifically, the Department demands that these passport applicants prove birth in the United States by producing a host of documents that go far beyond what other applicants must ordinarily produce. Instead, the Department arbitrarily and unreasonably deems Plaintiffs\' applications abandoned, classifying them as ""filed without further action"" or otherwise closed.\n3\n\n\x0cCase 7:08-cv-00057 Document 36 Filed in TXSD on 09/16/08 Page 4 of 55\n9. The Department is likely to claim that it needs to impose heightened passport requirements because several midwives working in Southwestern border states were convicted of fraudulently registering births in the region. Indeed, rather than\n4\n\n\x0cCase 7:08-cv-00057 Document 36 Filed in TXSD on 09/16/08 Page 5 of 55\nconducting individual inquiries, Defendants have stripped Plaintiffs and those who are similarly situated of the rights and benefits of U.S. citizenship to which they are entitled and have effectively reduced to second-class citizenship status an entire swath of passport applicants based solely on their being of Mexican or Latino descent and having been delivered by midwives in nonhospital settings in Southwestern border states.\n12. Plaintiff-Petitioner Amalia Ramirez Castelano is of Mexican descent and was born in Weslaco, Texas, in 1968: She currently resides in Mission, Texas. She subsequently received a letter, dated December 17, 2007, from the Department of State through its National Passport Center in New Hampshire, informing her that her passport application was being filed without action. He currently resides in Los Fresnos, Texas. Ms. Flores applied for a U.S. passport in November 2007. Director Barrett is sued here in her official capacity.\n28. In response to Plaintiffs and members of the proposed class, however, instead of adjudicating their passport applications as filed (with the same evidence deemed sufficient for the issuance of a passport in other cases), the Department, through written and, in many cases, telephonic communications, has demanded supplemental evidence of citizenship.\n51. We have not received a response from you, or you have not fully complied, with the request for additional information and/or documentation in the referenced correspondence. Therefore, your passport application is being filed without further action. It is also common that the Department issues ""filed without further action"" letters or otherwise closes applications before it has given applicants sufficient time to gather documents that have been demanded but that can be difficult and time-consuming to secure. See 22 C.F.R. § 51.65(b) (2008) (stating that passport applications will be denied or treated as abandoned if an applicant does not provide ""documentation sufficient to establish entitlement to passport issuance within ninety days of notification by the Department that additional information from the applicant is required"").\n78. The letter did not suggest any avenue of appeal for Ms. Castelano. Mr. Garcia\'s mother died in childbirth with his younger sister, and his birth was not contemporaneously registered. Enriqueta Gonzalez is identified on the ""suspicious midwives list"" as having been convicted, see Exhibit A at 2, but the evidence surrounding Sofia Elizabeth Lopez\'s birth demonstrates that her U.S. birth record is legitimate. Miriam Sujee Gonzalez was born in Brownsville, Texas, in 1976. See id. at 1.\n34\n\n\x0cCase 7:08-cv-00057 Document 36 Filed in TXSD on 09/16/08 Page 35 of 55\n129. On information and belief, Ms. Flores asserts that the Department\'s ""closure"" of her passport application was the product and function of the policy, pattern, and practice alleged herein.\n7. In the affidavit subsequently provided to the Department (in the applicant\'s second submission of evidence, dated March 31, 2008), J.S. \'s mother explained that she was not then and is not now ""residing"" in the United States. In a letter dated October 22, 2007, the Department also directed that Mr. Hernandez provide ""a combination of early public documents created prior to or at the time of [his] birth"" within 45 days. With the letter, the Department returned the numerous documents Mr. Hernandez had submitted.\n172. Mr. Aranda has lived in the United States his entire life. Therefore, your passport application is being filed without further action."" LDC v. Phillips, 401 F.3d 638, 642 (5th Cir. V.

See D.E. 88.\nDefendants answered the Second Amended Complaint, denying these allegations and asserting numerous defenses.\nB. Proposed Settlement Agreement After several months of negotiations, the parties reached a settlement that will dispose of this action. See Bass v. Phoenix Seadrill/78, Ltd., 749 F.2d 1154, 1164 (5th Cir. Obtaining timely relief is particularly important to Class Members now that the final phase of WHTI is in effect. See Mullen v. Treasure Chest Casino, LLC, 186 F.3d 620, 624 (5th Cir. That requirement is easily met here because there is at least one issue—the legality of the standards used by Defendants to adjudicate passport applications—whose resolution will affect all of the putative Class Members’ claims. If the Class Member elects re-\n\nadjudication, then the Class Member’s lawsuit shall be stayed, or dismissed\n\nwithout prejudice if ordered by the court. In addition, in an effort to provi de an alternative, the Department agrees\n\nto provide temporary mobile intake facilities in five (5) southe rn border locations\n\nfor one or two days each.

PR-DC-0003,"On July 31, 2017, plaintiff, the Democracy Project, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief against defendants Department of State, Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552. The plaintiff is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose focus is on informing the public of operations and activities of the government by gathering and disseminating information likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of executive branch operations and activities.

On April 6, 2017, President Trump ordered Tomahawk cruise missile strikes against a Syrian-government airbase without obtaining prior authorization from Congress (a Syrian-based policy promised by former President Barack Obama) and without articulating the legal justification for the strikes. The plaintiff submitted FOIA requests to the defendants the following day for all records “reflecting, discussing, or otherwise relating” to the strike “and/or the President’s legal authority to launch such a strike”. The plaintiff asked for these requests to be processed on an expedited basis. About one month later, having received none of the requested documents and having two of its expedited processing requests denied, the plaintiff brought this suit and filed a motion for preliminary injunction to have the documents produced by a date certain.

On July 13, 2017, U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction, directing the defendants to process the FOIA requests on an expedited basis, but not by a certain date, and to limit the request to documents specifically related to the legal justifications for the April 6, 2017 Syria Strikes. 263 F.Supp.3d 293.

On September 8, 2017, the defendants made a production pursuant to the FOIA requests, but the plaintiff contested that the production was too heavily redacted and insufficient. On November 17, 2017, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, with the plaintiff filing a cross-motion for summary judgment on December 8, 2017, on the question of whether the defendants’ withholding of some documents was justified under various FOIA exemptions. On April 25, 2018, Judge Cooper, in reviewing the parties’ cross-motions, determined that he needed to also review the documents before it could resolve the dispute, and he ordered that the defendants produce documents that it had claimed were exempted under FOIA for an in-camera review by the court. On May 4, 2018, the defendants complied with the order and delivered the documents to the court. 

On August 21, 2018, Judge Cooper granted in part and denied in part each party’s motion for summary judgment. 320 F.Supp.3d 162. He found that, for the most part, the defendants’ withholdings were justified; however, he also found that some information in the documents had already been officially acknowledged, so that the defendants could not withhold that information. As of March 23, 2019, there has been no further filings or movement in the case, and the case appears to be closed.","Plaintiff alleges as follows:\n\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE\n\n1. Defendant DOJ is headquartered at 950 Pennsylvania Avenue, NW, Washington, DC 20530-0001. Defendant has possession, custody, and control of the documents that Plaintiff seeks in response to its FOIA request. The U.S. Congress has not authorized the use of force against the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad. The United Nations Charter, a treaty ratified by the United States, permits the use of force against another country only with permission of the United Nations Security Council or as a matter of self-defense. To date, Defendant has failed to make the required determination and notifications. This request includes, but is not limited to, internal Department of Justice communications, communications between Department of Justice employees and the Executive Office of the President, and communications between Department of Justice employees and other agencies.\nThe timeframe for this request is April 4, 2017 through the present. Plaintiff also requested expedited processing pursuant to 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(E) and 28 C.F.R. § 16.5(e).\n36. Plaintiff’s request concerns “[a] matter of widespread and exceptional media interest in which there exist possible questions about the government's integrity that affect public confidence,” 28 C.F.R. § 16.5(e)(1)(iv) and because there is an urgent need “to inform the public about an actual or alleged Federal Government activity.” The public has an immediate right to understand the Administration’s position with\n9\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-00842-CRC Document 1 Filed 05/08/17 Page 10 of 14\nrespect to the legality of the recent strike against Syria, and to assess whether that position is justified.\n47. Pursuant to FOIA, within 20 business days of receipt of Plaintiff’s request – that is, May 5, 2017 – Defendant was required to “determine . . . Nor has Defendant made a determination regarding Plaintiff’s request for a fee waiver.\nState Department FOIA 58. Though Plaintiff disagrees with the State Department’s determination that a fee waiver is not warranted here, Plaintiff will forgo its appeal rights because of the urgency and importance of the records requested. For the reasons that follow, the Court will grant the former relief but deny the latter. Despite modest variations among the schemes, they are materially the same: Each at a minimum implements the “compelling need” standard. Aamer v. Obama, 742 F.3d 1023, 1038 (D.C. Cir. The relevant agency regulations identify similar considerations. Opp’n 12–13, none of those pending congressional resolutions specifically concerns the legality of the April 6 strikes against the Syrian government.\n7\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-00842-CRC Document 14 Filed 07/13/17 Page 8 of 14\npublic at large will be “precluded . . . 1988) (“[S]tale information is of little value.”). U.S.-led forces conducted strikes against pro-regime forces in Syria on May\n18, June 6, and June 8,3 and a U.S. fighter jet shot down a Syrian military jet on June 18.4 As the\nGovernment points out, these military actions may not have been directly related to the April 6\nstrike, which was aimed at punishing the Syrian government for its suspected use of chemical\nweapons. The day after the U.S. missile strike, a nonprofit called The Protect Democracy Project, Inc. submitted several requests under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”) seeking documents related to the President’s legal authority to launch the strike. The agencies released some responsive documents but withheld fifteen documents in full. The withheld documents fall into three categories. 33, at 3 (Apr. 25, 2018) (quoting Afshar v. Dep’t of State, 702 F.2d 1125, 1130 (D.C. Cir. Noting that little of the 2018 memorandum’s analysis was “particularized to the recent strike” and that some of its reasoning “closely align[ed] with the publicly stated rationale for the 2017 strike,” the Court found it “at least plausible that ‘specific information in the public domain’ (i.e., the 2018 memorandum) duplicated ‘that being withheld’ (i.e., the 2017 memorandum).” The first two\n5\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-00842-CRC Document 44 Filed 08/21/18 Page 6 of 19\ndocuments are final versions of the memorandum—one belongs to State and the other to DOJ. Surely if the government publicly releases information that specifically matches information it has withheld pursuant to a privilege under Exemption 5, that release amounts to a waiver of privilege. 2014).\nNor does the recently released 2018 OLC opinion officially acknowledge the contents of the 2017 memorandum. 1991); see also ACLU v. DOD, 628 F.3d at 621 (giving “substantial weight” to agency affidavit’s statement “that there are substantive differences between the content of the publically released government documents and the withheld information”). ACLU v. DOD, 628 F.3d at 620.\nThat leaves whether the legal memorandum is privileged, such that the agencies properly withheld it under Exemption 5.

IM-GA-0008,"On January 30, 2017, a lawful permanent resident (LPR) of the United States, represented by private counsel, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff was held for questioning at Atlanta International Airport as he was trying to return to his home to Atlanta, solely due to the Executive Order issued by President Donald Trump on January 27, 2017 suspending entry into the United States of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The complaint further alleged that the defendants, in denying an LPR re-entry after a brief visit abroad, violated Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The complaint was filed as a petition for mandamus (directing inspection of returning LPRs under the INA rather than under the Executive Order) and a civil complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. 

The plaintiff was an Iraqi refugee who has worked for CNN since 2004 and currently is an International Desk Producer. He was based at CNN's Atlanta bureau and travels to the Middle East regularly for his reporting work. On January 29, 2017, after returning to the US from a trip to Iraq, he was detained and questioned at Atlanta International Airport, before being released. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff alleged that he was therefore uncertain whether he may leave and re-enter the United States in the future, and that this is a substantial problem, because he travels often for his work.

The case was assigned to Judge Timothy Batten.  On February 1, the plaintiff filed an emergency motion to expedite proceedings, arguing that the issues raised in the complaint are of immediate importance and could evade review if not expedited. On February 2, the court ordered the defendants to respond by February 8 to the plaintiff's emergency motion. On February 7, the government filed a motion to dismiss and on February 8 they filed a response in opposition to the plaintiff's emergency motion. On February 9, the plaintiffs filed an answer to the government's response, and on February 10 Judge Batten denied the motion to expedite proceedings. 

On February 17, the plaintiffs filed a motion to extend the response timeline to the government's motion to dismiss. On February 21, Judge Batten granted plaintiffs' motion for an extension through February 28.

On Feb. 27, the plaintiffs filed a response to the government's motion to dismiss the complaint as moot. The plaintiffs argued that executive documents issued to clarify the EO do not change the clear text of the EO, which is still binding and still purports to exclude all ""immigrants"" - including LPRs like the named plaintiff - despite the government's clarifying documents indicating otherwise. The plaintiffs further argued that, as the EO remains in effect and the defendants have therefore not yet established full voluntary cessation of their conduct, the EO falls under a mootness exception for conduct ""capable of repetition yet evading review."" 

Prompted by adverse developments in the Ninth Circuit in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15606"">Washington v. Trump</a>, another litigation challenging the Executive Order, on Mar. 6, 2017, the President rescinded the Jan. 27 Executive Order and replaced it with a narrower one, <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/09/2017-04837/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states"">Executive Order 13780</a>.

On Mar. 9, the parties filed a joint motion to extend the reply and pretrial discovery timeline. The court granted this motion on Mar. 13. The parties now have until Mar. 23 to file a discovery plan and for the defendants to respond on their Feb. 7 motion to dismiss the complaint as moot. 

On Mar. 21, the parties filed a joint motion to extend the reply timeline. On Mar. 22, the court granted the motion, giving plaintiff through Mar. 23 to file an amended complaint and giving the government 30 days from the plaintiff's filing date to respond. The court additionally allowed the government to withdraw its Feb. 7 motion to dismiss the complaint. 

On Mar. 23, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint challenging Section 1(g) (which applied greater scrutiny to Iraqi nationals during the visa issuance/U.S. admissions process) and Section 4 (which provides that applications for visa/admissions/any immigration benefit by Iraqi nationals should be ""subjected to thorough review"") of the second EO. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that no section of the EO removes Iraqi LPR's from the ""additional scrutiny"" and ""thorough review"" requirements, in violation of the INA, APA, and Fifth Amendment due process rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as a writ of mandamus instructing DHS to instruct its employees inspecting aliens at U.S. points of entry to exclude returning Iraqi resident immigrants from the new screening terms under the EO. 

On Apr. 24, the government filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.

The parties filed a joint preliminary report and discovery plan on July 7. Later in July, the parties noted their disagreement over the discovery deadlines, and discovery was stayed pending the district court's ruling on the Apr. 24 motion to dismiss. 

On Aug. 11, Judge Batten granted the defendants' Apr. 24 motion to dismiss the amended complaint, finding that Tawfeeq lacked standing to challenge sections 2 (which does not apply to Iraqi nationals such as Tawfeeq), 1(g) (which the plaintiffs acknowledge would only apply to Tawfeeq if erroneously implemented, and the court will not presume that the law would be erroneously implemented), and 4 (which the court determined was too speculative to grant standing). Finally, the court determined that the revocation of the January EO rendered moot Tawfeeq's claims challenging its application to lawful permanent residents.  

This case is now closed. ","Acting )\n\nSecretary of State, Department of State. ) Mr. Tawfeeq has been placed on CNN special assignments along the Syria-Lebanon border and in Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Libya.\n44. Mr. Tawfeeq told officials that he had been repeatedly fingerprinted by the U.S. government when embedded with the U.S. military in Iraq.\n55. Mandamus lies in the present action because Defendants owe Plaintiff a non-discretionary legal duty to permit his return to the United States without admission.\n119. In short, INA Section 212(f) does not allow the President to trump the presumption in INA § 101(a)(13)(C) that returning permanent resident aliens have not legally exited the United States, nor to circumvent the hearing process available to such aliens whom the government believes do not qualify for that presumption.

The documents cited are part of an ever-shifting interpretation of the EO.\nSecond, the memorandum and press release are best viewed as Defendants’ latest musings regarding the EO’s application to LPRs. As such, the statements provide no assurances to Plaintiff that the interpretations will not change again at a moment’s notice or that a CBP officer would choose those non-binding interpretations over the EO’s clear language.\nIndeed, the Government has argued before the Ninth Circuit that the President retains vast authority to engage in “the categorical, temporary suspension the President has adopted” in the EO. 19-1 at 6 (“if there was a question as to the applicability of the Executive Order to Plaintiff Mr. Tawfeeq on the day he filed the instant Complaint”) (emphasis added).\n-16-\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-00353-TCB Document 25 Filed 02/27/17 Page 17 of 27\nMoreover, Defendants have argued in the Ninth Circuit for broad authority that would permit them to enforce the current EO against LPRs, or to issue further EOs that cover LPRs. 2d 1266, 1269-70 (M.D. Ala. 2014).\nHere Defendants clearly believe that the President has the ability to unilaterally suspend the entry of returning LPRs into the United States on a whim.

PB-FL-0015,"On February 28, 2014, a same-sex couple married outside of the state of Florida filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida against the state of Florida. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983, declaratory judgment, and costs. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the state ban against same-sex marriage violated their rights under the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, the First Amendment (right to associate), and violated the Supremacy Clause and the Establishment Clause. This case was captioned as <i>Brenner v. Scott</i>. 

On March 12, 2014, several same-sex couples married outside of the state of Florida, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, filed essentially an identical lawsuit, also in the Northern District of Florida. This case was captioned as <i>Grimsley v. Scott</i>. On April 21, 2014, the Court (Judge Robert L. Hinkle), upon a joint motion, consolidated the two cases for case management purposes. Both cases are addressed in this summary and Clearinghouse case record.

On April 24, 2014, Judge Hinkle denied permission to Florida Family Action, a ""cultural action organization"" that opposes same-sex marriage, to intervene as a party. FFA was permitted, however, to file amicus briefs. 298 F.R.D. 689 (N.D. Fla. 2014). 

On August 21, 2014, Judge Hinkle issued a preliminary injunction, finding Florida's ban on same-sex marriage a violation of plaintiffs' fundamental right to marry under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses (using strict scrutiny in the analysis). The court stayed the preliminary injunction in these cases until ninety-one days after similar stays were denied or lifted in three cases pending in the Fourth and Tenth Circuit Courts—<i>Bostic v. Schaefer</i>, 2014 WL 3702493 (4th Cir. July 28, 2014); <i>Bishop v. Smith</i>, 2014 WL 3537847 (10th Cir. July 18, 2014); and <i>Kitchen v. Herbert</i>, 2014 WL 2868044 (10th Cir. June 25, 2014). Brenner v. Scott, -- F.Supp.2d --, 2014 WL 4113100 (N.D. Fla. 2014). 

On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States held, in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12787"">Obergefell v. Hodges</a>, that the right to marry was fundamental. In the opinion written by Justice Kennedy, the Court held that it demeans gay and lesbian couples to deprive them of access to marriage. The Fourteenth Amendment thus did not allow states to ban same-sex marriage. Kennedy was joined without further writing by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor. Each of the four dissenters—Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito—wrote a dissent. 

On August 4, 2015, the <i>Grimsley</i> plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. The defendants opposed, arguing that the court should not grant summary judgment but rather dismiss the case as moot.

Meanwhile, the defendants moved for voluntarily dismissal of the appeal at the Eleventh Circuit. On October 19, 2015, the Eleventh Circuit granted the voluntary dismissal transferred consideration of attorney's fees to the district court. On January 12, 2016, the issue of appellate's attorney's fees was also transferred to the district court for consideration. 

On March 2, 2016, the <i>Brenner</i> plaintiffs filed a separate motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs asked that the court not dismiss this case as moot because the same-sex marriage ban was not repealed and Florida's Surgeon General persisted in refusing to issue birth certificates to the children of same-sex couples. On March 30, 2016, Judge Hinkle granted the plaintiffs summary judgment and declared the Florida Constitution, Article I, § 27 as well as Florida Statutes § 741.212 and  §741.04(1) as unconstitutional. Judge Hinkle also issued an injunction to prohibit the defendants from enforcing or applying the Florida provisions that were declared unconstitutional. The court granted and denied in part the defendant’s motion to dismiss as moot; it dismissed the claims against the Clerk of Court as moot but not the claims against the Surgeon General and Secretary. Subsequently, the court entered judgment for the plaintiffs against the Secretary of the Department of Management Services and the Surgeon General, but the court dismissed without prejudice the claims against all other defendants. 

On April 13, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion for entitlement to attorneys’ fees and costs, which the court granted and determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to a fee award. The parties, however, then filed a joint notice of settlement on attorney’s fees and costs. (The amount that the parties settled on is not publicly available.) On June 16, 2016, the plaintiffs officially withdrew their fee petition and notified the court that they received their settlement funds.

In short, it is settled that a state’s marriage provisions must comply with the Fourteenth Amendment and may be struck down when they do not.\nIt bears noting, too, that the defendants’ invocation of Florida’s prerogative as a state to set the rules that govern marriage loses some of its force when the issue raised by 20 of the 22 plaintiffs is the validity of marriages lawfully entered in other jurisdictions. 4:14cv107-RH/CAS and 4:14cv138-RH/.CAS\n\n\x0cCase 4:14-cv-00107-RH-CAS Document 74 Filed 08/21/14 Page 28 of 33\nPage 28 of 33\nVI.

CJ-CO-0004,"On November 7, 2017, a former pretrial detainee who was incarcerated for several weeks in the El Paso County Colorado Jail filed suit against that county in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff, represented by the ACLU Foundation of Colorado, sought compensatory damages and attorney’s fees, claiming violations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. 

The plaintiff claimed that El Paso County had an official policy and actual practice of denying pretrial liberty to defendants granted a personal recognizance (PR) bond by a state court judge, solely for their inability to pay a $55 pretrial service fee to the county. While incarcerated, the plaintiff was separated from her newborn child when child custody proceedings were initiated against her that she was unable to competently contest while she was in jail. The plaintiff also claimed that state court judges in the county believed that they could not waive this fee without express permission from a bond commissioner of El Paso County Pretrial Services; they argued that employees of that agency were disincentivized from doing so because the $55 fee is chargeable before release funded the county’s pretrial supervision program. 

A little over a week after the complaint was filed, the Denver Channel reported that Chief Judge William Bain of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Colorado, which includes all state courts in El Paso County, had ordered that detainees granted a personal recognizance bond but unable to pay the $55 pretrial services fee must be released from jail that same day.

On December 28, 2017, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint with an expanded fact section, emphasizing that El Paso County, through its sheriff, was the sole party blocking the release of detainees unable to pay the $55 fee to the county under the former policy. 

The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on January 11, 2018. The county alleged that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. Specifically, the county argued that the plaintiff could not demonstrate that there was such a county policy or that the county was the “moving force” of the policy as described. Before Judge Wiley Young Daniel could make a decision on this motion, the parties informed him that they were working on a private settlement. Over the next several months the judge extended several deadlines for the parties to allow them to continue exploring a private settlement. 

According to the ACLU’s <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/news/el-paso-county-agrees-pay-190k-nearly-200-individuals-who-were-jailed-because-they-could-not"">website</a>, the parties agreed to settle out of court for $190,000 on August 13, 2018. According to the <a href=""https://gazette.com/news/el-paso-county-agrees-to-pay-up-to-to-settle/article_6de96e20-a00d-11e8-908c-1fe35bfd4cf4.html"">Gazette</a>, the agreement was finalized once it was approved by the El Paso County Board of County Commissioners on August 14, 2018. The settlement provided $60,000 to compensate the plaintiff for her incarceration and for attorney costs. The remaining $130,000 was allocated for 183 other individuals who the parties identified who had been held in the El Paso County Jail solely for inability to pay the $55 fee. Each of them are eligible for compensation based on $125 per day of incarceration. The parties eligible for this compensation must contact the county within two years to recover these funds.  

On August 17, 2018, Judge Daniel dismissed the lawsuit with consent of the parties. The case is now closed.

( This matter is before the Court sua sponte. 17-cv-02656\n\nJasmine Still, v.\n\nPlaintiff,\n\nEl Paso County, Colorado, Defendant.\n______________________________________________________________________________ COMPLAINT AND JURY DEMAND\n______________________________________________________________________________ Plaintiff Jasmine Still, by and through her counsel, Rebecca Wallace and Mark Silverstein\nof the AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION FOUNDATION OF COLORADO, respectfully alleges for her Complaint and Jury Demand as follows:\nINTRODUCTION 1. This civil rights action is authorized and instituted pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiff Jasmine Still is a resident of, and domiciled in, the State of Colorado. The El Paso County Combined Court is in session five days every week. On each of these days, new arrestees who have been charged with a crime, but are innocent in the eyes of the law, appear before a judicial officer for a bond determination. On every day or almost every day court is in session, a judicial officer grants a number of newly arrested individuals a supervised personal recognizance bond. When a court orders a personal recognizance bond, it orders that the defendant shall be released from jail, pending trial, without any obligation to post money. A PR bond signifies a judicial determination that the defendant is neither a flight risk nor likely to cause serious harm to another. Instead of posting a sum of money, a defendant who is granted a personal recognizance bond signs an agreement to appear in court as required in the future and, if applicable, to comply with certain release conditions (e.g. refraining from illegal drug use). This fee serves as the primary funding source for ECPS.\n18. Indeed, pursuant to the official policy and consistent practice of El Paso County, the Sheriff of El Paso County is required to continue imprisoning individuals who are granted a personal recognizance bond if they cannot first pay the county-imposed fee of $55.\n4\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-02656-WYD-KLM Document 1 Filed 11/07/17 USDC Colorado Page 5 of 16\n20. On any given day, between 4 and 12 defendants who had been granted a PR bond were held in the El Paso County Jail for failure to pay the pretrial services fee;\nc. The assessment included a close analysis of ECPS’s policies as they relate to PR bonds. Ms. Still is a 26-year-old mother of three. That ECPS chose to assess Ms. Still and then recommended her for release on a personal recognizance bond places Ms. Still among a very small percentage of the defendants who enter the El Paso County Jail. She had no way to access money and no one on the outside who was willing and able to pay the fee. The El Paso County Jail designated Ms. Still as indigent, which entitled her to such necessities as hygiene supplies and postage.\n45. Upon information and belief, Ms. Still appeared on every Daily List produced by ECPS from January 12 until her release, which was likely a total of 18 lists. As the days passed, Ms. Still remained incarcerated while her children slipped farther from her grasp. The offer required Ms. Still to either have a residence, be working, or be going to school. Plaintiff hereby incorporates all other paragraphs of this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. Ms. Still has a fundamental interest in her pretrial liberty. Defendant deprived Ms. Still of her liberty without meaningful or prompt consideration of her ability to pay the fee. Defendant held no hearing on ability to pay and put no meaningful procedural safeguards in place to protect against the erroneous deprivation of liberty that occurred in this case.\n71. El Paso County policy and actual practice utilize PR Bond Commissioners as the decisionmakers with authority to waive the pretrial services fee.\n74. The PR Bond Commissioners’ salaries are funded, in significant part, through payment of pretrial services fees. /s/ Rebecca Wallace Rebecca Wallace Mark Silverstein ACLU Foundation of Colorado 303 E. Seventeenth Ave., Ms. Still is one of hundreds of individuals who have been granted a PR bond by the court, but whom El Paso County nonetheless has held in jail solely because they were unable to pay the $55 fee. However, in El Paso County, at all times relevant to this Complaint, it was only those detainees with the means to pay a county-imposed fee of $55 who had the opportunity to gain prompt release upon the court’s grant of a supervised personal recognizance bond.\n16. The Community Services Department consists of Park Operations, Planning, Recreation / Cultural Services, Environmental Services, Veteran Services, and Community Outreach. El Paso County, through ECPS’s written policies and official communications, instructed judicial officers of El Paso County Combined Courts that they did not have the independent authority to waive the pretrial services fee and that a judge could waive the fee only if an ECPS PR Bond Commissioner has first recommended waiver.\n24. El Paso County, including ECPS and the El Paso County Sheriff’s Office, have long been aware that the policy at issue has caused a significant number of pretrial defendants who have been granted a PR bond to remain incarcerated solely because they are unable to pay the pretrial services fee.\n36. She has struggled with substance abuse and is currently in intensive treatment. Of those assessed, the NIC found that ECPS recommends only 8% be released on a PR bond.\n11\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-02656-WYD-KLM Document 10 Filed 12/28/17 USDC Colorado Page 12 of 19\n45. On January 11, 2017, the El Paso County Court accepted ECPS’s recommendation and ordered that Ms. Still be released on a supervised PR bond.\n46. El Paso County was well aware that Ms. Still was stuck in jail solely because she was unable to pay the pretrial services fee.\n49. Additionally, upon information and belief, on January 12, Ms. Still first appeared on the Daily List produced by ECPS. Despite actual knowledge of Ms. Still’s incarceration for poverty as evidenced by the Daily List, El Paso County chose to continue to incarcerate Ms. Still rather than releasing her on the PR bond and leaving the fee as a debt to be paid by Ms. Still after her release from jail.\n53. The motion explained that she was unable to pay the fee and that her incarceration was causing her children to be placed in foster care.\n56. She decided that, rather than wait in jail while she fought her case, she had no choice but to plead guilty so that she could get out of jail quickly and fight for custody of her children.\n61. On February 6, Ms. Still pleaded guilty to felony possession and was promptly released from custody. At all times during Ms. Still’s incarceration, El Paso County retained the authority and duty to release her from custody, without payment of the county fee, on the personal recognizance bond granted by the court. That liberty interest becomes even stronger once bail is set, especially when the court orders release on personal recognizance. Defendant had no process by which Ms. Still could even request from ECPS a recommendation to waive the pretrial service fee.\n81.",0.67,0.2978,0.4123,0.2122,0.0942,0.1305,0.243,0.108,0.1496
PC-CO-0028,"On November 3, 2016, a female prisoner in the custody of the Denver Women’s Correctional Facility filed this pro se lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiff sued the State of Colorado, the Colorado Department of Corrections, and the Warden of the Denver Women’s Correctional Facility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking damages. She claimed that defendants violated the ADA as well as her constitutional rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. 

Specifically, the plaintiff alleged she was denied a Sorenson Video Phone (SVP) after she placed multiple requests with the Department of Corrections to provide one so that she could communicate with her parents, who were deaf. The SVP offers a service for the deaf community paid for by the government for those who qualify under the ADA. Although the plaintiff originally struggled to meet the court’s pleading standards, once she obtained counsel from the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center on March 31, 2017, she filed a third amended complaint on June 15, 2017, adding three new plaintiffs. The new complaint also added claims under the Rehabilitation Act and replaced allegations of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations with claims of First Amendment violations. 

The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Gordon P. Gallagher and then later reassigned to Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak. On June 30, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, claiming that the plaintiff lacked standing to assert her claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act and that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

The court disagreed with the defendants’ arguments and on September 29, 2017, denied the motion to dismiss. The court found that the plaintiff had standing to assert her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, that the plaintiff pleaded sufficiently plausible claims for relief. 

On January 22, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint, adding two plaintiffs and removing the Fourteenth Amendment claim. The defendants filed an answer to this complaint on February 5, 2018. The plaintiffs dismissed an additional defendant on October 25, 2018 without explanation. Four days later, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that the Colorado Department of Corrections could not prove that the TTY phones it had were as effective as videophones and that CDOC provided no affirmative defenses under the Effective Communication Claim. In response, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on October 29, 2018, arguing in part that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies through the prison grievance system.

The plaintiffs joined their case with <i>Rabinkov v. Colorado Department of Corrections</i>, another federal case against the CDOC regarding the provision (or lack thereof) of videophones to deaf prisoners or relatives of deaf individuals on November 20, 2018. On December 27, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class of similarly-situated deaf prisoners; however, the motion was withdrawn less than a month later. 

On January 14, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 17, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On January 25, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim for failure to state a claim; this was dismissed by Judge Varholak on April 9, 2019. Defendants then moved for summary judgment and for dismissal on mootness grounds on May 6, and June 21, respectively. 

On September 18, 2019, Judge Varholak ruled on several outstanding motions: the defendants’ motion to dismiss, filed on June 21, 2019, one plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, filed on January 17, 2019, and the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, filed on May 6, 2019. Judge Varholak denied the June 21 motion (finding that the defendants had not met the burden to show that the plaintiffs’ claims were moot), granted the January 17 motion (one plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment on ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims), and granted in part and denied in part the May 6 motion (finding that two out of three plaintiffs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies but denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss regarding the remaining plaintiff’s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, First Amendment claims, and claims for compensatory damages). Finally, Judge Varholak ordered the Colorado Department of Corrections to make videophones available and to adopt effective and comprehensive policies relating to videophones. 2019 WL 4464036.

On October 4, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a joint motion for referral to a settlement conference, and Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter was assigned to conduct a settlement conference. The parties gave no reason for the sudden change in tactic. Currently, the conference is scheduled for October 28, 2019. The case is ongoing.

IM-TX-0053,"COVID-19 Summary: This is a habeas action filed by four immigrants held at the Montgomery Processing Center, seeking release in light of COVID-19. The plaintiffs alleged that they were particularly vulnerable to the virus due to their medical conditions. In April, the court issued a temporary restraining order that provided for the release of one of the individual plaintiffs. In September, the court entered an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for individualized bail hearings. Three detainees were released in October. The defendants appealed in November. The case is ongoing. <hr>

On April 8, 2020, a group of four immigrants in detention filed this lawsuit against U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (""ICE""), ICE officials, and the warden of the Montgomery Processing Center (""MPC""). Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the petitioners sought writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Alternatively, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the petitioners argued that by detaining them, the defendants were subjecting them to an unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19 in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

The case was assigned to Judge Keith P. Ellison.

On April 10, the plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order.

On April 17, Judge Ellison entered an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order. 455 F.Supp.3d 330. The government was required to release one plaintiff from detention because the plaintiff did not have a history of violence, so the danger to the plaintiff in detention outweighed the public interest in safety; the court issued this order as a preliminary injunction rather than a temporary restraining order. The court declined to order the release of another plaintiff due to his history of violence and violation of previous court protective orders. Ten days later that plaintiff was transferred to a different detention facility. (The two other individual plaintiffs had already been released.) 

On April 29, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint with four additionally plaintiffs with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness or death if they contracted COVID-19. Two of those plaintiffs were later released on May 1. The plaintiffs also filed a motion to certify the class. The proposed class consisted of ""all individuals detained at MPC who have been diagnosed with or are receiving treatment for an enumerated list of medical conditions... and/or who are over the age of 50."" 

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on May 1 on the basis that the plaintiffs' claims were mooted after each was either transferred or released. On May 1 and 4, the plaintiffs moved to expedite discovery and to expedite relief. In the meantime, at least six detainees and five MPC staff members had tested positive for COVID-19. 

On May 25, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss because the plaintiff that secured release through the April 17 preliminary injunction still had standing to amend the complaint since her claims had not been finally adjudicated. The court also ordered that plaintiffs submit supplemental information on the proposed class certification before the court rule on the other outstanding motions. 2020 WL 2617939.

Defendants filed another motion to dismiss the amended complaint on June 5. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on June 7 which was denied as moot on June 23. Several detainees filed an emergency motion to intervene on July 30 which was granted on August 31. The court found that the intervenors met the requirements for permissive intervention, but not intervention as of right.

The intervenors filed a complaint, adopting the prior allegations and making additional allegations, and a motion for a temporary restraining order on September 4. 

On September 10, the court denied defendants' motion to dismiss and on September 21, the court declined to grant provisional class certification, but granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited relief and outlined a process for the parties to proceed with individualized bail hearings for plaintiffs with high risk medical conditions that did not have violent and felonious criminal histories. 2020 WL 5646138. The court noted that by July 29, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among detainees at MPC was reported to be 206. By August 11, defendants reported zero active cases and deaths, but the court noted that it ""lack[ed] confidence in these numbers."" The court also noted that ""the timeline of events at MPC demonstrates that, despite the measures [d]efendants allegedly implemented, the detention facility nonetheless experienced a significant outbreak of COVID-19 while those measures were already in place.""

In October, the court granted bail for three detainees and denied bail for one detainee. 2020 WL 6130717. On November 20, the defendants appealed the bail determinations and the court's September 21 order granting the plaintiffs' motion for individualized bail hearings.

JC-NM-0010,"On May 15, 2015, the mother of a deceased prison inmate filed this lawsuit against the San Juan County Detention Center, the San Juan County Regional Medical Center, and San Juan County in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought damages and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging wrongful death and violations of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants’ actions and policies constituted severe and deliberate indifference to the medical needs of her son, who suffered injuries and death as a result of receiving insufficient medical care while incarcerated. 

The plaintiff’s claims were consolidated with those of three other plaintiffs suing the San Juan County Detention Center, for the pretrial and discovery purposes, although the parties agreed that each case was to be tried separately. Two other individual plaintiffs had filed complaints alleging Eighth Amendment violations, ADA violations, negligence, and wrongful death in June 2015. On July 28, 2015, twenty-seven plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint in the District of New Mexico in <i>Burkee v. San Juan</i>. The <i>Burkee</i> plaintiffs asserted causes of action for Eighth Amendment violations, negligence, ADA violations, and intentional infliction of emotional distress (IIED). On August 24, 2015, the consolidated case was assigned to Judge James O. Browning. 

On September 28, the plaintiffs moved for injunctive relief, requesting either that the court order the defendants to provide emergency medical care to the plaintiffs, or appoint an independent medical overseer for the facility. On November 17, the court dismissed all federal claims against the defendants, holding that the plaintiffs’ complaint did not meet the requisite pleading standards. On January 15, 2016, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction on the grounds that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim. The plaintiffs each filed an amended complaint on February 29, 2016, alleging violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as state tort claims. 

The lead plaintiff in this case entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants, which was approved by the District Court on September 19, 2016. The details of the settlement were not made publicly available. On September 20, 2016, the court dismissed all claims under the A.D.A. and state law. On September 30, 2016, the court entered its final judgment, dismissing the lead plaintiff’s claims against the defendants with prejudice. Salazar v. San Juan Cnty. Det. Ctr., No. CIV 15-0417 JB/LF, 2016 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 141408, at *41 (D.N.M. Sep. 30, 2016). The case of one of the other individual wrongful death plaintiffs was also dismissed on September 30, 2016.

Following settlement and dismissal of the lead plaintiff's case, proceedings in two of the other consolidated cases continued. In the other individual wrongful death plaintiff's case, claims against the San Juan County Detention Center were dismissed on December 12, 2016. The claims against San Juan Regional Medical Center and its employees and agents on July 31, 2017.

In the <i>Burkee</i> case, the San Juan County Detention Center, its administrator, and San Juan County moved to dismiss the A.D.A. and state law claims, and Judge Browning granted the motion on September 20, 2016. On March 31, 2017, Judge Browning denied the San Juan Regional Medical Center's motion to dismiss the nine remaining plaintiffs' IIED claims and motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' state law claims. Judge Browning also granted the plaintiffs' August 15, 2016 motion to remand to state court. The court found that the remaining plaintiffs' federal claims had already been dismissed, and it declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, remanding the case to the Eleventh Judicial District Court, San Juan County, New Mexico. The court explained its rationale in an October 13, 2017 memorandum opinion. 301 F.Supp.3d 992 (D.N.M. 2017). Judge Browning issued a final judgment in the case on October 27, 2017. After discovery in the district court, the case was dismissed in the state court on June 12, 2018.","['Case 1:15-cv-00417-JB-LF Document 1 Filed 05/15/15 Page 1 of 15\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW MEXICO\nCivil Action No. ""\n\n64.\n\nAn argument then occurs when officers are asking medical staff to\n\nexplain how this situation is not an emergency.\n\n65.\n\nJesus was moved to the toilet when the officer told Katie about blood\n\ncoming from Jesus\' mouth. 102-11 in Salazar v.

I. LAW REGARDING PRELIMINARY INJUNCTIONS. When a prisoner is incarcerated after being indicted, the Eighth Amendment\nprotects him from “a prison official’s ‘deliberate indifference’ to a substantial risk of serious harm,” as well as the intentional use of excessive force. See also Hudson v. McMillian, 503 U.S. at 13 (Blackmun, J., concurring)(“The Court today appropriately puts to rest a seriously misguided view that pain inflicted by an excessive use of force is actionable under the Eighth Amendment only when coupled with ‘significant injury,’ e.g., injury that requires medical attention or leaves permanent marks.”). See Self v. Crum, 439 F.3d 1227, 1230 (10th Cir. 2006)(holding that prison officials violate detainees’ due process clause rights when the officials’ “acts or omissions [are] sufficiently harmful to evidence deliberate indifference to serious medical needs”)(quoting Estelle v.

Moreover, the Plaintiffs do not refer to the Fourteenth Amendment in any of the Complaints. The facility may contain a mixture of pre-trial detainees and people convicted of crimes and the Plaintiffs may be a mixture.26 The Plaintiffs, however, have not advised the Court precisely of each Plaintiffs’ status, nor have they alleged or\n26Veneno’s testimony at the November 24, 2015, hearing on the Motion supports the view that the San Juan County Detention Center is a mixed facility. Regardless whether the Plaintiffs plead their 42 U.S.C. § 1983 claim under the Eighth Amendment or the Fourteenth Amendment, the Court concludes that the Plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the Defendants acted deliberately indifferent to their medical needs. As to Matamoros’ complaint about not being sent to a neurosurgeon, the Court credits the medical records submitted by the Defendants demonstrating that Matamoros saw Dr. Kainth, who stated that “[t]his is not a life-threatening problem and he is currently neurologically intact.” of Regents of University of New Mexico, 2004-NMCA-003, ¶ 5, 84 P.3d 685, 686 (citing Hicks v.

DR-DC-0007,"On August 14, 2018, two children with mental health disabilities in the District of Columbia and University Legal Services, Inc. filed this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and a class of children with mental health disabilities, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the District of Columbia under:<ul><li>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 <i>et seq.</i>;</li><li>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;</li><li>The Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights program, 29 U.S.C. § 794;</li><li>Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid Act), 42 U.S.C. § 1396; and</li><li>42 U.S.C. § 1983.</li></ul>The plaintiffs, represented by the National Center for Youth Law, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in-house counsel, and private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief together with costs and attorney’s fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the District of Columbia failed to comply with mandates of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Medicaid Act. Specifically, they claimed that the District of Columbia failed to provide medically necessary intensive community-based services (ICBS) to children with mental health disabilities.

Intensive community-based services consist of three components:
<ol><li><i>Intensive care coordination</i> (ICC): designing and supervising a plan to provide and coordinate services to children that includes the child, the child’s family, and service providers;</li><li><i>Intensive behavior support services</i>: individual therapy provided to the child where they live; and</li><li><i>Mobile crisis services</i>: crisis response services that can provide care in a child’s home, school, or community.</li></ol>In their complaint, the plaintiffs acknowledged that the District of Columbia provides some components of ICBS. For example, the District offers the “high fidelity wraparound” ICC program, “community-based intervention” services, and the Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) intensive support program. But the plaintiffs alleged that the District’s existing services “fail[] to provide medically necessary ICBS” for many children who need them. 

The complaint did not name the putative class representatives. Instead, the plaintiffs moved that the minor plaintiffs be allowed to proceed anonymously. Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell granted this motion on August 14, 2018. Judge Howell determined that the plaintiffs have a “strong interest” in protecting “highly sensitive details” about their mental health that would be revealed in the litigation that outweighs the government defendants’ “minimal” interest in disclosure.  

The District moved to dismiss the case on October 3. First, it argued that the two individual plaintiffs lack standing. The District claimed that the first individual plaintiff refused to use the District’s existing wraparound services, that the second would not be eligible for ICBS because she is in the custody of the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, and that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a claim by University Legal Services alone. Second, it argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because the plaintiffs’ allegations involve the adequacy of care rather than where the District provides services. Finally, the District argued that the plaintiffs’ allegations that it violated Medicaid requirements were “threadbare . . . conclusory statements” that could not support a claim under the pleading standard set in <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i>. 

On July 25, 2019, the court (now Judge Emmet G. Sullivan) denied the motion to dismiss holding that the individual plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit, had sufficiently stated a claim under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and had sufficiently alleged a § 1983 claim. 401 F.Supp.3d 1.

As of July 2020, discovery is ongoing.

Motion to Dismiss for Failure to State a Claim\nDefendants argue that the plaintiffs have failed to state a claim for violations of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and failed to state a claim for a violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\n1. Id. at 26\nDefendants\' first argument fails because it is based on a fundamental misunderstanding of plaintiffs\' claims. 2176.\nPlaintiffs have alleged these exact harms and others. Olmstead stands for the proposition that it is a violation of the ADA, the Rehabilitation Act, and their implementing regulations to required disabled individuals to obtain treatment in residential institutions when such individuals have the ability and desire to receive treatment in more integrated community settings. "").\nThis is especially the case when a plaintiff alleges that the state failed to provide 13*13 required community-based treatment programs. Id. Plaintiffs also explain why the services provided fall short of that goal. See Mendoza v. Perez, 754 F.3d 1002, 1010 (D.C. Cir. Minute Order dated Feb. 21, 2020.\n\n\x0cCase 1:18-cv-01901-EGS-GMH Document 66 Filed 07/01/20 Page 2 of 18\nchildren’s privacy, and—with respect to Plaintiffs’ request for the contact information of the children’s treating mental health professionals or facilities—that it would be unduly burdensome to provide.2\nBecause Plaintiffs have shown that the contact information of the children and of their guardians is discoverable, their motion to compel is granted in part. 59-2 at 3–7.\nBefore Plaintiffs filed the motion to compel, the parties met and conferred regarding Defendants’ objections to the interrogatories. It did not, as Defendants claim, cast doubt on the propriety of obtaining putative members’ contact information in class discovery for purposes other than providing notification of opt-in or opt-out rights.\nIndeed, “[t]he Supreme Court has recognized the importance of allowing class counsel to communicate with potential class members for the purpose of gathering information . . . Neither argument is availing.7\nDefendants first contend that Plaintiffs have failed to show a need for the information requested in Interrogatories 1 and 2 because they already have access to sufficient information to seek class certification.

It is therefore unlikely that Plaintiffs would misuse putative members’ contact or mental health information.\nFurthermore, in recognition of the fact that “the information sought by [P]laintiffs is worthy of extraordinary protection,” G.D., 2007 WL 2206559, at *4, the Court will impose two conditions on all information produced pursuant to Interrogatories 1 and 2. Second, any birthdates disclosed to Plaintiffs must omit the precise day of each putative member’s birth and include only the birth month and year, because only the latter information is relevant for when putative members will age (or have aged) out of the putative class.10 With these restrictions, the putative members’ privacy interests will be adequately protected.",0.6512,0.2882,0.3996,0.2244,0.0992,0.1376,0.2368,0.1048,0.1453
PN-OR-0004,"This lawsuit, filed on July 21, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, was brought by the Western State Center (a public benefit corporation), the First Unitarian Church of Portland, a private individual, and two Oregon State Representatives. Represented by private attorneys, they sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Federal Protective Service, and the U.S. Marshal Service over the defendants' presence and role in quelling protests that ensued after the police killing of George Floyd in May of 2020.

The complaint alleged violation of the First and Tenth Amendments. The First Amendment claim was brought by First Unitarian Church and argued that the defendants' arrests of protesters were in violation of the First Amendment right to protest, but also in violation of the Free Exercise clause, as protest was an integral part of the church's philosophy. The Tenth Amendment claim, brought by all plaintiffs, claimed that the federal agencies' enforcement of law on Portland property (and not just federal property) amounted to an unconstitutional violation of the principles of federalism. Plaintiffs requested declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Michael W. Mosman and Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo.

However, on July 27, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint. The amended complaint retained the arguments about free speech, free exercise, and principles of federalism, but added other claims regarding the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the federal agents were arresting Portland residents without probable cause, adding that some of these arrests were caught on video. Protesters were taken off the street by non-uniformed federal officers and hauled into unmarked vans. 

Two days later the plaintiffs submitted a motion for a temporary restraining order with an expedited hearing and a motion for a preliminary injunction. However, on August 4 the court granted an email request to withdraw the motion for a temporary restraining order as moot. This is probably because the court had already granted a TRO against against federal agents in Portland in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17707&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseName%7CIndex%20Newspapers%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B><i>Index Newspapers</i></a> earlier in the week. The plaintiffs continued to seek a preliminary injunction.

On October 22 and 30, the court held oral argument on the motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Mosman granted the preliminary injunction with respect to the First Amendment claims, but denied the preliminary injunction with respect to the Tenth Amendment claim. 2020 WL 6555054. While Judge Mosman found no showing that the federal agents acted with retaliatory motive, he found that the President and Acting Secretary Chad Wolf expressed such a motivation and the plaintiffs were entitled to some form of injunctive relief. Under the preliminary injunction, Judge Mosman limited the defendants from engaging in crowd control beyond an extended city block around the U.S. Courthouse. 

The defendants promptly appealed to the Ninth Circuit (docket no. 20-35959) and requested a stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied the defendants' emergency motion for a stay pending appeal without prejudice to renewal after the district court ruled on the motion to stay pending appeal. Then on November 9, 2020, the court held a status conference and vacated the order for the preliminary injunction as no longer necessary. The defendants subsequently dismissed the appeal.

On December 4, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing because the plaintiffs did not attend the protest and the feared injuries were not injuries in fact or traceable to federal agents' conduct. In addition, they argued that the First Amendment allegations were actually weaker than what was considered in the preliminary injunction motion. The defendants also requested a stay of discovery.

The parties then consented to proceed before Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo. Magistrate Judge Russo extended the discovery deadline to November 30, 2021. As of December 30, 2020, the motions to dismiss and stay discovery remained pending. This case is ongoing.

The patrol was not in the nature of “hot pursuit” of a malefactor from a federal situs broadly through Portland. Consistent with Pettibone’s testimony, Ken Cuccinelli, the Deputy Secretary of the defendant Department of Homeland Security, was asked in a July 17 interview with National Public Radio that federal agents used unmarked vehicles to pick up protesters in U.S. cities, and admitted this occurs, stating, “Well, in Portland, they have.” While the federal government may protect its property and personnel, the federal government is constrained by the Constitution from policing the City of Portland broadly speaking, and there is no positive delegation of authority in any law that makes the federal government’s recent forays into general policing in Portland either legal or constitutional.

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they engaged in unconstitutional strip searches of the plaintiffs and detained the plaintiffs for unreasonable lengths of time. This case was one of three cases alleging mistreatment of persons arrested and taken to Central Booking for booking and processing. The other cases were JC-MD-0008: Maryland NAACP v. Baltimore City Police Department, 1:06-cv-01863-CCB (D. Md. 2006) and JC-MD-0011: Rodney v. Murphy, 24-C-05004405, filed in Maryland state court. 

Plaintiffs sought certification for five classes. First, the suspicionless strip search class which consisted of those who had been or would be arrested for crimes not involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, who were strip searched by Central Booking employees without any individualized finding that they were harboring weapons, drugs, or other contraband. Second, the non-private strip search class was composed of those who had been or would be subjected to strip searches at Central Booking with other arrestees present. Third, the equal protection strip search class consisted of male arrestees strip searched at Central Booking while similarly-situated female arrestees were not. Fourth, the underwear strip search class was made up of male arrestees subjected to an underwear strip search while similarly-situated female arrestees were not. Fifth, the over-detention class consisted of those arrested without warrants who had been or would be detained for an unreasonable length of time (more than 48 hours) before presentment to a judicial officer for a determination of probable cause. 

The defendants moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim. The District Court (District Judge Catherine C. Blake) granted the motion in part and dismissed all claims against the City and the Police Department, rejecting the theory of ""entrustment liability.""  Claims against the state defendants survived, with the exception of individual claims against the current warden. 470 F.Supp.2d 537 (D. Md. Jan 04, 2007). 

On July 11, 2008, the district court (Judge Blake) issued a memorandum on the issue of whether the gender-differentiated search policy violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the issue and denied the defendants' motion.

On March 19, 2009, the district court partially granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify a class.  Specifically, the court certified the following subclasses: 1) those people detained for more than 48 hours without having been brought before a commissioner, and 2) those people arrested for minor, nondrug, nonviolent offenses and strip-searched before they were brought before a commissioner. The court declined to certify the following subclasses: 1) those people who weren't strip-searched privately, and 2) male arrestees who were searched to their underwear when female detainees were not.

For the next two years, discovery motions were exchanged, until the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 14, 2011. 

On March 5th, 2013 Judge Blake issued a memorandum and an order granting the motion for partial summary judgment. The court granted the motion under the doctrine of qualified immunity. 

The plaintiffs filed an appeal on August of 2013.  A panel of three judges rendered a decision on November 11, 2014. 771 F.3d 209 (4th Cir. 2014). The Circuit Court (Circuit Judge James Harvie Wilkinson III) affirmed the district court's decision to grant partial summary judgment for the defendants. The court noted that several police officers and guards testified that they found illegal contraband from these searches. And the searchers were being conducted in a private room. On the issue of qualified immunity, the court noted that the right to not be subjected to a strip search was not clearly established at the time of the searches. A Supreme Court decision was filed in 2012, settling aspects of the issue after the fact, but before this, officers who were conducting searches, could not reasonably tell if the searches were violating a constitutional right. The court found the defense of qualified immunity acceptable here, and determined that the motion for partial summary judgment was properly granted. 

Circuit Judge James Andrew Wynn Jr. filed a concurring opinion in which he pointed out that the Supreme Court intimated in the <i>Florence</i> decision that there may be exceptions to the rule. That detainees not being admitted into the general population should not have to be stripped searched. The complexities of the exceptions had not been explored by the courts, and Judge Wynn noted that there needed to be more elaboration on this topic, so public officials would know how to act accordingly. However, the merits of the case were not be reached because of the granting of summary judgment. 

On February 24, 2015 Judge Blake filed a memo regarding the January 31, 2011 motion for partial summary judgment. 2015 WL 790334. The motion was made by the warden-defendant, over the class of Plaintiffs claiming that Central Booking practiced ""over-detention.""  The court held that the plaintiffs' theory of supervisor liability was defective because there was no evidence that the warden-defendant was deliberately indifferent to the constitutional injury of the Plaintiffs. The warden-defendant did not deny that there were detainees held longer than 48 hours, which was past what was constitutionally acceptable, but she argued that it was caused by factors outside of her control. The court agreed that the delays in presenting detainees before a court commissioner was the fault of the Baltimore police, the state's attorneys office, and court officials. Furthermore, the court argued that the warden had made several efforts to remedy the problem, and that the plaintiffs' complaint that it was not fast enough or proactive enough did not prove deliberate indifference. Finally, the court also granted the summary judgment motion on the theory of qualified immunity, so the defendant had no fair warning that her conduct was unconstitutional. 

A few months later on June 15, 2015 the Court entered final judgment and closed the case.

FA-IN-0001,"On December 3, 2013, the University of Notre Dame, a religious nonprofit university, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Notre Dame alleged that the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) contraception insurance mandate, even with the accommodation for nonprofit religious organizations, violated the Establishment Clause and Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Notre Dame sought preliminary and permanent injunctions barring the government from enforcing the contraception insurance mandate to avoid a violation of Notre Dame's deeply held religious beliefs.

On December 20, 2013, the District Court (Judge Philip P. Simon) denied Notre Dame's motion for preliminary injunction. The Court found that the ACA's insurance accommodation, which allowed the head of an eligible organization to provide self-certification which in turn triggered a third-party administrator to provide contraception coverage to the organization's employees, did not impose a substantial burden on the free exercise of the religion. University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 988 F.Supp.2d 912 (N.D. IN. 2013) The same day, Notre Dame filed an interlocutory appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (No. 13-3853) and a motion for preliminary injunction with the District Court pending their appeal. 

On December 23, 2013, the District Court denied the plaintiff's motion for injunction pending appeal and on December 30, 2013, the Seventh Circuit denied the plaintiff's emergency motion for injunction pending appeal. 

On February 21, 2014, the Seventh Circuit (Judge Richard Posner) affirmed the District Court's denial of preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals found that the ACA's insurance accommodation was consistent with the balancing act required by RFRA and therefore it did not substantially burden the free exercise of plaintiffs. University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (N.D. IN. 2014). On May 7, 2014, the Seventh Circuit denied plaintiffs' April 4, 2014, motion for rehearing. 

Notre Dame sought review in the Supreme Court, and on March 9, 2015, the Court granted the writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Seventh Circuit for further consideration in light of its decision (after the Seventh Circuit's decision) in <i>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</i>, 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014). University of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 135 U.S. 1258 (2015) (cert. granted). In <i>Hobby Lobby</i>, the Supreme Court had held that the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violated RFRA, when applied to closely held for-profit corporations. The Court emphasized, however, that alternative methods for meeting the government's asserted interest were available. 

On remand, after hearing oral arguments on April 22, 2015, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's denial of preliminary injunction on May 19, 2015, holding that Notre Dame had still not met its burden of establishing an entitlement to a preliminary injunction. University of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 606 (7th Cir. 2015).

Notre Dame sought a rehearing en banc on July 2, 2015. The Seventh Circuit denied the request on July 24, 2015. On June 17, 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Seventh Circuit in light of the per curiam decision in <i>Zubik v. Burwell</i>, 136 S.Ct. 1557 (2016) (Clearinghouse summary available <a href=” https://www.clearinghouse.net/featuredCase.php?id=36”>here</a>). In <i>Zubik</i>, the Supreme Court vacated a series of Court of Appeals decisions that concerned religious exemptions to the contraception mandate in the ACA and remanded those cases back to the lower courts to “afford an opportunity” for the parties and the Court of Appeals to further consider the burden imposed in requiring non-profit religious organizations (“challengers”) to fill out a form notifying the government that they objected to providing contraceptive coverage, and to arrive at an approach that would, going forward, accommodate challengers’ religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by the challengers’  health plans receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.

As it appeared that proceedings in the Seventh Circuit would continue for some time, the case was statistically closed in the district court on March 2, 2017, until the appellate proceedings concluded. The case remains ongoing in the Seventh Circuit.","\n\n)\n\nDefendants.\n\n)\n\n)\n\nCOMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL 1. It simply asks that the government not impose its values and policies on Notre Dame, in direct violation of its religious beliefs.\n4. It is also an educational organization under Section 170(b)(1)(A)(ii) of the Internal Revenue Code.\n10. She is sued in her official capacity.\n12. Notre Dame currently serves more than 11,500 undergraduate and graduate students annually and it is consistently rated one of the best universities in the country.\n23. The Alliance for Catholic Education (“ACE”), a component of Notre Dame’s Institute for Educational Initiatives, helps sustain and strengthen Catholic schools. ACE teachers are intentionally placed in under-resourced and high-need schools, often with predominantly low-income, and frequently predominantly minority, student populations. ACE also seeks to help Catholic schools and their students outside of the United States. To the contrary, the goal of the program is to create a tight-knit group of international leaders of different faiths and beliefs who will foster international peace.\n41. Notre Dame offers health insurance plans to eligible employees and students. Meritain handles the administrative aspects of Notre Dame’s self-insured employee health plans, but Meritain bears none of the risks for benefits nor is it obligated to pay health care providers. See 26 U.S.C. § 4980H(a), (c)(1).\n12\n\n\x0c64. See 42 U.S.C. § 300gg-22(b)(2)(C)(i); see also Cong. Under ERISA, plan participants can bring civil actions against insurers for unpaid benefits. Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2012, Pub. Defendants dispensed with notice-and-comment rulemaking for these rules. In stark contrast with the agreement essential to passage of the Affordable Care Act and President Obama’s promise to protect religious liberty, the HHS’s new guidelines required insurers and group health plans to cover “[a]ll Food and Drug Administration approved contraceptive methods, sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling for all women with reproductive capacity.” Id. at 46,626 (codified at 45 C.F.R. § 147.130(a)(iv)(A)-(B)). They did not request further discussion or attempts at compromise. ”\nC. The White House Has Refused to Expand the Exemption 108. Student Health Insurance Coverage, 77 Fed. But a promise to change the law, whether issued by the White House or in the form of an ANPRM, does not, in fact, change the law.\n123. Thus, implementing even basic changes to Notre Dame’s employee and student health plans requires substantial lead time.\n132. Notre Dame’s fiscal year starts in July and budgeting for major expenses starts approximately one year in advance. In accordance with the apostolic constitution Ex Corde Ecclesiae, Notre Dame believes and teaches that “besides the teaching, research and services common to all Universities,” it must “bring[] to its task the inspiration and light of the Christian message.” “ As Notre Dame’s employee health plans are self-insured, Notre Dame would be paying directly for contraception and sterilization in direct conflict with its religious beliefs.\n152. The Government therefore cannot possibly demonstrate that requiring Notre Dame to violate its consciences is the least restrictive means of furthering its interest.\n31\n\n\x0cB. The U.S. Government Mandate’s Religious Employer Exemption Aggravates the Constitutional and Statutory Violations\n160. The limited and ill-defined religious exemption provided in the U.S. Government Mandate conflicts with the Constitution and RFRA.\nC. The U.S. Government Mandate’s Religious Employer Exemption Excessively Entangles the Government In Religion, Interferes With Religious Institutions’ Religious Doctrine, and Discriminates Against and Among Religions\n179. An actual, justiciable controversy exists between Notre Dame and Defendants. Absent a declaration resolving this controversy and the validity of the U.S. Government Mandate and Exemption, Notre Dame is uncertain as to its rights and duties in planning, negotiating, and/or implementing its group health plans, and it is threatened with the impossible choice between paying for prescriptions and procedures in violation of the Catholic Church’s moral teaching, or discontinuing its health plans in violation of the Catholic Church’s social teaching.\n37\n\n\x0cIV. RFRA prohibits the Government from substantially burdening an entity’s exercise of religion, even if the burden results from a rule of general applicability, unless the Government demonstrates that the burden furthers a compelling governmental interest and is the least restrictive means of furthering that interest.\n204. The Government is also requiring student health plans, including the one currently offered by Notre Dame, to include abortion-inducing drugs, sterilization, and contraception, and related education and counseling.\n218. Notre Dame has no adequate remedy at law. Notre Dame repeats and realleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. The Government has no compelling governmental interest to require Notre Dame to comply with the U.S. Government Mandate.\n239. The U.S. Government Mandate is not narrowly tailored to further a compelling governmental interest.\n240. Requiring Notre Dame’s student health plan to include services that violate its religious beliefs is not the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling government interest.\n244. In order to qualify for the exemption to the U.S. Government Mandate for “religious employers,” entities must submit to an invasive government investigation into an\n43\n\n\x0corganization’s religious beliefs, including whether the organization’s “purpose” is the “inculcation of religious values” and whether the organization “primarily employs” and “primarily serves” individuals who share the organization’s religious tenets.\n251. The enactment and impending enforcement of the U.S. Government Mandate violate the Free Exercise Clause and the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The U.S. Government Mandate and its impending enforcement impose an immediate and ongoing harm on Notre Dame that warrants relief.\nCOUNT IV Religious Discrimination in Violation of the Free Exercise and Establishment Clauses of the First Amendment 258. In accordance with this Catholic doctrine, Notre Dame has made the internal decision that its employee and student health plans may not cover, subsidize, or facilitate abortifacients, sterilization, or contraception.\n280. Because the U.S. Government Mandate interferes with the internal decisionmaking and organizational structure of Notre Dame in a manner that affects its faith and mission, the U.S. Government Mandate violates the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause of the First Amendment.\n284. Notre Dame has no adequate or available administrative remedy, or, in the alternative, any effort to obtain an administrative remedy would be futile.\n317. V.

PC-GA-0017,"The plaintiff in this case is a transgender female. She was denied medically necessary healthcare and suffered repeated sexual assault and harassment throughout her incarceration. The plaintiff suffered from gender dysphoria and—despite her feminine appearance—the defendant assigned her to a maximum-security male prison. In these facilities, transgender inmates often face the highest risk of sexual violence. 

The plaintiff brought this action in the Middle District of Georgia on February 19, 2015 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the defendant staff at the Georgia Department of Corrections, Rutledge State Prison, and Valdosta State prison. The plaintiff claimed deliberate indifference to her medical needs in denying medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria, violations of her Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment, failure of guards to protect her from serious sexual assault, and failure to train prison personnel regarding transgender inmates' health and safety. Represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and private counsel, the plaintiff requested declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the Georgia Department of Corrections to adhere to professional standards of care in treating inmates that suffer from gender dysphoria. 

The plaintiff was first imprisoned in 2012. Within the first month of her imprisonment, the plaintiff was sexually assaulted by six gang members. The plaintiff was sexually assaulted by other inmates more than half a dozen times throughout her three-year incarceration. The defendants also denied her medically necessary hormone treatment. But the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies and failure to state a claim. They also asserted qualified immunity defenses. 

In the meantime, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order, on April 20, 2015. At this hearing, the court put consideration of her preliminary injunction on hold to investigate new policies that the Georgia Department of Corrections had implemented since the beginning of the suit. 131 F. Supp. 3d 1353. 

Less than five months later, the plaintiff was released from prison. She was only three years into an eight year sentence on August 31, 2015. The court then ruled on the defendants' various motions to dismiss on September 14, 2015. First, the plaintiff's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief were mooted and dismissed without prejudice as a result of her release from prison. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's deliberate indifference to a serious medical need claim and failure-to-protect claim because the plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Further, the court held that defendant prison personnel were not entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiff's deliberate indifference to a serious medical need claim and that the defendant medical director was not entitled to qualified immunity on the failure-to-protect claim. Finally, the court held that the plaintiff sufficiently pleaded that defendant medical director failed to train subordinates regarding the safety of transgender inmates and that this failure resulted in deliberate indifference to Diamond’s constitutional right to reasonable protection—the defendant medical director was not entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.  

The parties reached an undisclosed monetary settlement and filed a stipulated dismissal on February 11, 2016. 

As a result of the lawsuit, the Georgia Department of Corrections no longer uses the “freeze frame” policy that prohibited transgender inmates from receiving treatment or updating treatment plans as needed. Many transgender inmates in Georgia now receive hormone therapy. Moreover, the defendants have adopted a sexual assault prevention policy that adheres to federal standards. These prevention policies are supplemented by training programs for prison staffers that address the unique needs of transgender inmates. The case is now closed. ","VERIFIED COMPLAINT\n\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Defendant McCracken is among those responsible for denying Ms. Diamond medically necessary care and failing to reasonably protect Ms. Diamond from sexual assault, and is sued in his individual capacity.\n21. She is sued in her individual and official capacities.\n23. The Standards of Care have been recognized as the authoritative and clinically accepted treatment for gender dysphoria by the American Psychiatric Association, the American Medical Association, courts that have considered the issue, and members of the medical community at large.\n30. In recent years, GDC has been confronted with numerous complaints and lawsuits by inmates concerning the failures of staff to protect them from assault. During her intake, Ms. Diamond was warned by Valdosta personnel that Valdosta lacked the means to safely house transgender persons like Ms. Diamond, and that she stood a high likelihood of being sexually assaulted based on the inmate population, which included many gang members. Upon information and belief, Dr. Harrison also advised Defendants Allen and McCracken of Ms. Diamond’s ongoing safety issues and need for a transfer to a safer facility, based on her conclusion that Ms. Diamond stood a substantial risk of continued sexual assault at Valdosta based on the inmate composition. On or about February 26, 2014, Ms. Diamond personally contacted Defendant McCracken regarding her safety. Ms. Diamond informed Defendant McCracken that she was a transgender woman with gender dysphoria, in need of medical care. Ms. Diamond explained that she was being sexually assaulted, but her requests for protection were being ignored. Ms. Diamond asked Defendant McCracken to review her placement, and to arrange her transfer to a safer facility, but he delayed and deferred any action on Ms. Diamond’s behalf, and she continued to be a constant target for sexual harassment and coercion.\n116. Dr.\n27\n\n\x0cCase 5:15-cv-00050-MTT Document 3 Filed 02/19/15 Page 28 of 39\nHarrison observed that Ms. Diamond’s PTSD symptoms and anxiety had worsened due to ongoing issues of personal safety, and concluded that Ms. Diamond should be transferred to a medium security prison for her safety. Each of the Defendants also implemented, followed, enforced, and continue to enforce a policy or custom, having the force of law, of refusing requests to initiate gender dysphoria treatment, irrespective of an inmate’s medical need, and providing counseling alone when they knew it was grossly inadequate care, that placed inmates at a substantial risk of mental and physical deterioration.\n137. Ms. Diamond incorporates and realleges herein the foregoing paragraphs. 366241 Southern Poverty Law Center 1989 College Ave. 3, ¶ 86).\n- 7 -\n\n\x0cAfter Diamond filed a grievance about the denial of treatment, Hatcher placed her in solitary confinement twice: once for “pretending to be a woman” and then again after attorneys visited her. ( Johnson v. Meadows, 418 F.3d 1152, 1156 (11th Cir. As discussed more fully below, when a grievance alleges sexual assault, “the grievance process is terminated and the matter is forwarded\n- 12 -\n\n\x0cto the Internal Investigation Unit and/or the PREA coordinator for review.” ( She does allege she contacted Allen about safety concerns. ( Id.)\nAccusing Diamond of “plucking select phrases out of context,” Allen asserts that the Valdosta failure-to-protect grievance did not complain about sexual assault but rather “in Plaintiff’s own words, [expressed] a concern for her ‘personal safety and mental health’ at Valdosta ‘because of staff involvement in making videos to supposedly\n- 26 -\n\n\x0chelp us.’” ( ”).\n- 29 -\n\n\x0cPointing to GDOC’s general requirement that grievances must be filed within ten days the inmate “knew, or should have known, of the facts giving rise to the grievance,” Allen and McCracken argue the Court should find as a matter of fact that the Baldwin grievances were untimely. Rather, the GDOC officials testified, as a matter of fact and without any contradiction by the Defendants, that GDOC’s grievance procedures do not impose a deadline for filing grievances alleging sexual assaults. Referring the grievances to\n18 Pursuant to GDOC procedure, [a]t any time before the Warden’s Grievance decision is delivered to the offender, the Warden may refer the matter to the Internal Investigations Unit. Second, he must satisfy the\nsubjective component by alleging that the prison official was deliberately indifferent to\n23 A comment about Lewis, Allen, Hatcher and Shelton’s joint brief is appropriate. ( Id. at 911.\nSimilarly, Diamond has alleged the Defendants knew the medically accepted and recognized gender dysphoria treatment pursuant to the Standards of Care; knew about Diamond’s diagnosis, treatment history, and attempts to commit suicide and self-harm; and communicated with her directly about her gender dysphoria. See McElligott v. Foley, 182 F.3d 1248, 1256 (11th Cir. In her response brief, Diamond states that she is alleging Lewis had actual knowledge, not constructive knowledge. ( 1999) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 3, ¶¶ 73, 75-76, 96-97, 110-111, 116-17). Rather, Diamond has provided sufficient factual support to show a widespread, flagrant, obvious pattern of a continued duration that GDOC officials failed to reasonably respond to multiple incidents of sexual assaults or to the substantial risk of assault Diamond faced at closed-security facilities.\nFurther, Diamond has sufficiently alleged Lewis deliberately chose not to remedy this inadequate training despite her responsibility to review the placement of transgender inmates and train subordinates regarding their safety. See Valdes, 450 F.3d at 1244.\nWith respect to the allegedly inadequate training regarding the medical treatment of transgender inmates, it was clearly established Lewis’s failure to adequately train subordinates or otherwise take reasonable institutive corrective measures “in the face of a history of widespread abuse” was unlawful. In particular, the United States files this Statement to bring the Court’s attention to the standards used to evaluate appropriate medical care for gender dysphoria under the Eighth Amendment and the unconstitutionality of freeze-frame policies that may prevent such treatment. 1981) (explaining that “prison officials have a duty to protect prisoners from self-destruction or self-injury”)).

CJ-MI-0008,"On April 14, 2019, several pre-trial detainees in Wayne County Jail filed this class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the 36th District Court in Detroit, the Wayne County Sheriff's Office (WCSO), the Chief Judge, and five Magistrates of the 26th District Court in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the Sixth Amendment's Right to Counsel. The case was assigned to Judge Laurie J. Michelson. 

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants unconstitutionally detained them in Wayne County Jail because they were unable to pay for their release and that the defendants' current arraignment policies created a wealth-based detention system that kept the plaintiffs in jail for their inability to afford bail. All of the plaintiffs included in the complaints were arrested and had their arraignment hearings held in the 36th District Court in Detroit. The plaintiffs were not provided attorneys during their arraignments and in each instance, the plaintiffs were ordered to pay cash bail amounts beyond their financial abilities. The arraignment policies provided two different condition forms: (1) 10% bail condition, which required the plaintiff to pay 10% or the real estate equivalent of their bail amount in order to be released; or (2) full cash bail condition, which required the plaintiff to pay the full amount. The magistrate judges that set the plaintiffs' bail amounts did not inquire whether the plaintiffs could afford their set bail amounts. When plaintiffs notified the court that they were unable to pay bail, they were sent to Wayne County Jail. 

The plaintiffs also sought class certification of all pre-trial detainees that had their bail set during arraignment hearings held in the 36th District Court and as a result of the court's bail policies were detained because they could not afford their imposed cash bail conditions. 

On June 10, 2019, WCSO moved to dismiss the complaint. They alleged that the plaintiffs could not seek injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because: they were an entity entitled to quasi-judicial immunity where declaratory relief was available; under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for municipal liability because obeying court orders is not considered a policy of the municipality; and the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that clearly established law would have put WCSO on notice that obeying a court order for pretrial incarceration would expose it to liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. 

On June 19, 2019, the Chief Judge moved to dismiss plaintiffs' class action complaint.

A stipulated stay order was entered on August 23, 2019 to allow time for discussions between the parties as to resolution of the matter. Meanwhile, the Detroit News <a href=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2020/04/01/former-detroit-magistrate-whistleblower-lawsuit/5103584002/>reported</a> that a former Detroit magistrate judge filed a federal whistleblower lawsuit alleging that she had been fired after raising concerns about violations of defendants' rights in the 36th District Court. 

As of April 12, 2021, the case remains stayed. However, the court has held telephone status conferences, and the case remains ongoing.

Plaintiff Keith Wilson is a resident of the City of Detroit and Wayne County. Plaintiff Davontae Ross is a 24-year-old Black man. Plaintiff Timothy Lucas is a 65-year-old Black man who suffers from several serious health conditions, including epileptic seizures, hypertension, and asthma. Mr. Lucas cannot afford to pay the bail amount set in his case. She was arrested on April 8, 2019 for a felony assault charge. The magistrate did not ask her any questions about her ability to afford the bail amount, explain why it was set at\n10\n\n\x0cCase 2:19-cv-11076-LJM-EAS ECF No. The magistrate did not provide any explanation for why his bail was set at this amount. The magistrate told Mr. Wilson that his bail was $25,000/10% but did not ask him if he could afford that amount. Ms. Gardner was arraigned on April 12, 2019 via videoconference. She could not understand what the magistrate was saying. Yet, as detailed below, the policy and practice of the 36th District Court is that the Magistrate Defendants offer no opportunity for an arrestee’s indigency to be considered at the arraignment. 1 filed 04/14/19 PageID.19 Page 19 of 66\nDefendants preside over the arraignments based upon a revolving schedule that is determined administratively at the 36th District Court.

In such cases, the district judge who presided at the missed hearing (or in which payment was not completed) will have already issued a bench warrant as a result of the arrestee’s non-appearance and will have dictated the associated secured cash bail. 1 filed 04/14/19 PageID.25 Page 25 of 66\n66. Thus, ironically, it is only detainees with the\nresources to retain an attorney in the first place who are afforded an opportunity to\n4 Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households in 2017, May 2018, available at https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/files/2017-report-economic-wellbeing-us-households-201805.pdf. Despite the fact that the Magistrate Defendants are aware that inability to pay is regularly raised even by detainees who can afford counsel, these Defendants continue their policy and practice of not inquiring into the ability of unrepresented detainees to satisfy secured cash bail conditions.\n83. Shortly after an arrestee is arraigned by video at the DDC, the arrestee is transferred to the custody of the Wayne County Sheriff’s office and is transported to one of the three jails operated by the Sheriff (“the Wayne County Jails”).\n86. As a result, people arrested in Michigan for most offenses have a liberty interest under state law in being released pending trial without secured cash bail conditions, absent a specific individualized finding that such conditions are necessary to protect the public or ensure attendance at future hearings.\n95. 34\n\n\x0cCase 2:19-cv-11076-LJM-EAS ECF No. Upon receiving an assignment, there is no viable procedure by which court-appointed counsel can have her client’s bail conditions reconsidered prior to the probable cause hearing, at least a week after arraignment.\n100. 1 filed 04/14/19 PageID.38 Page 38 of 66\nthat hearing. Instead, the district judge will request that the Pre-Trial Services Unit prepare a report for consideration at the next hearing, i.e., the preliminary examination that occurs approximately a week later.\n102. She may miss rent payments and get evicted.12 She may suffer setbacks in an\neducational program or miss important medical appointments. Most jails offer little or no recreational or rehabilitative programs. Two Plaintiffs, Mr. Ross and Mr. Moore, have missed classes (including examinations in Mr. Moore’s case), and will continue to face additional educational setbacks if their detention continues.\n16 See Gina Clayton, Endria Richardson, Lily Mandlin, & Brittany Farr, Ph.D., Because She’s Powerful: The Political Isolation and Resistance of Women with Incarcerated Loved Ones, Essie Justice Group, available at https://www.becauseshespowerful.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Essie-JusticeGroup_Because-Shes-Powerful-Report.pdf\n42\n\n\x0cCase 2:19-cv-11076-LJM-EAS ECF No. Plaintiffs’ family members are suffering in their absence too. Even when the attorney is prepared to make such arguments, it is not uncommon for district judges to postpone a decision on reducing bail until the next hearing (the preliminary examination), another five to seven days later. This effectively coerces some detainees to plead guilty, particularly those\nwho face some of the harms discussed above, such as eviction, job loss, and loss of\nchild custody.\nii. After brief periods of detention, each additional day a person spends\nlocked in jail increases the likelihood that she will be rearrested after she is\nreleased, largely as a result of the economic harms she will have suffered as a\nresult of her detention.23\n121. Recognizing the limitations and dangers of secured bail, other jurisdictions rely on alternative measures to ensure that people show up for court. 1 filed 04/14/19 PageID.50 Page 50 of 66\ncommon, and even when personal bonds are granted they are not granted as a result of an inquiry into the arrestee’s ability or inability to afford secured cash bail conditions.\n125. This fact removes any legitimate (let alone compelling) state interest in the setting of a financial condition. Instead, it continues to operate a pretrial detention system based on wealth.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS 132. Joinder is impracticable because the class is both too numerous and too fluid for the Court to feasibly hear their independent claims.\n137. Plaintiffs incorporate all of the allegations above.

PN-MI-0013,"This lawsuit was filed on August 31, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs included Detroit Will Breathe (DWB) and fourteen individuals. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel on behalf of the National Lawyers Guild, sued the city of Detroit, Mayor Michael Duggan, Police Chief James Craig, and over one hundred Detroit Police Department (DPD) officers. 

Between May 29, 2020 and August 22, 2020, the plaintiffs participated in protests across Detroit calling for the end of police brutality and racial injustice. The plaintiffs stated that the DPD used excessive force on multiple occasions during the approximately 90 protests that the plaintiffs engaged in during this time period. These instances of excessive force included police driving cars into protest leaders on June 28; using dangerous chokeholds and teargas on peaceful protesters on July 10; and using additional pepper spray, teargas, and chokeholds on protestors on August 22. The plaintiffs also alleged alleged that a curfew imposed by the defendants was only enforced against protesters.

The plaintiffs alleged that these actions violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly, and also violated their Fourth Amendment protection against excessive force, arrest without probable cause, and false imprisonment. They also alleged that defendants' actions represented retaliation forbidden under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and contended that the city of Detroit was liable under the <i>Monell</i> theory of liability. The plaintiffs requested injunctive, monetary, and declaratory relief, including punitive damages, and asked for attorneys' fees and costs. 

The same day that they filed their complaint, the plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which would prohibit the DPD from using weapons against peaceful protesters or arresting protesters without probable cause. The plaintiffs also sought basic amenities, such as access to water and the provision of necessary medical attention, be for any protesters that were arrested.

The case was originally assigned to District Judge Robert H. Cleland and Magistrate Judge Anthony P. Patti, but was then reassigned to District Judge Laurie J. Michelson and Magistrate Judge David R. Grand on September 1, 2020.

On September 4, 2020, the court partially granted the request for a temporary restraining order (TRO). 2020 WL 5269789. Judge Michelson enjoined the defendants from using weapons against peaceful protesters, from placing individuals in choke-holds or hitting them with vehicles, from using zip ties or handcuffs in a way that causes injury, and arresting demonstrators without probable cause. The order was to last 14 days. However, the defendants thought that the order was one-sided. They submitted a motion to modify the TRO on the grounds that it would allow protesters to break the law without repercussions. Judge Michelson disagreed. On September 16, Judge Michelson issued an order denying the defendants' request to modify the TRO, holding that the TRO in no way allowed plaintiffs or other protesters to break the law without legal consequences -- DPD was still allowed to arrest those that sought to break the law. 2020 WL 8575150. The parties jointly agreed that police officers would refrain from using weapons (batons, shield, etc.), chemical agents, or chokeholds against protestors, and also agreed not to arrest demonstrators en masse without probable cause.

The defendants answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim on September 25, alleging that the plaintiffs engaged in a civil conspiracy. The defendants sought compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. The defendants also sought declaratory judgment stating that the plaintiffs defamed Mayor Michael Duggan and multiple police officers.

After the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the defendants' counterclaim, the counterclaim was dismissed on March 10, 2021. Judge Michelson found that the city did not allege that the plaintiffs committed an underlying tort to support the conspiracy allegation, nor did the city allege sufficient factual allegations to sustain a conspiracy charge even if it could proceed without an underlying tort.

JC-CO-0008,"This case, filed in federal court in 2011 and settled in 2012, addressed the Adams County Sheriff’s Department and its communication with deaf inmates of its jail. 

The case’s complaint described an incident in May 2010 in which law enforcement was called on two individuals engaged in an argument. Neither of the two--who became the case’s individual plaintiffs--could speak, write, or read effectively in English. As a result, when Sheriff’s deputies arrived, the plaintiffs were not able to communicate or explain what had happened. Nonetheless, the complaint alleged that the deputies failed to provide a sign language interpreter or any other effective auxiliary aid. Instead, one of the individuals was arrested for allegedly hitting the second individual, despite the attempts by both to explain that no violence had occurred. While in custody, the arrestee was required to sign several forms that he did not understand, including a Miranda form acknowledging that he knew his rights. Throughout his 25-day detention at the Adams County Detention Facility, staff failed to provide him with appropriate auxiliary aids or services. He was unable to call anyone, to communicate during his medical intake, or understand why he was being detained.

This lawsuit followed. It was filed November 23, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition the two deaf individuals just described. The plaintiffs sued the Sheriff of Adams County in his official capacity under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Represented by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition Legal Program, they sought declaratory and monetary relief, and an injunction requiring the defendant to provide qualified sign language interpreters or other appropriate auxiliary aids or services to ensure effective communication with deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. 

On January 26, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two additional individual plaintiffs. One was another deaf individual who communicated only through American Sign Language. He was detained at the Adams County Detention Facility for six days and unable to communicate during his detention. The other plaintiff was his aunt. The amended complaint also added the Colorado Association of the Deaf as a plaintiff.
 
On March 13, 2012, District Judge John L. Kane referred the case to Magistrate Judge Boyd N. Boland. The parties then spent the next several months engaging in settlement conversations. On September 25, they moved to dismiss the case because they had reached a settlement agreement.
 
The agreement required the defendant to change jail policies to ensure that detained individuals who required sign language interpretation knew how to request it. The settlement also required the defendants to provide training for staff, verify and monitor compliance with the agreement, and pay $100,000 to the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition Legal Program. On September 27, 2012, Judge Kane granted the parties’ motion to dismiss the case and retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement for two years. There are no further docket entries. The enforcement period was scheduled to end in 2014, so the case is now closed.","Attachments: # 1 Civil Cover Sheet, # 2 Receipt)(lyg, ) (Entered: 11/25/2011)\n2 SUMMONS Returned Executed by Timothy Siaki, Kimberlee Moore, Colorado Cross−Disability Coalition.

Neither deputy attempted to offer or provide auxiliary aids and services to Ms.\n6\n\n\x0cCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB Document 1 Filed 11/23/11 USDC Colorado Page 7 of 21\nMoore.

Mr. Siaki did not understand his Miranda rights. For the entirety of his time at the Adams County substation, the Adams County Deputies and staff did not offer or provide Mr. Siaki with a means by which he could communicate his need for a sign language interpreter.\n78. Ms. Moore was unaware of the restraining order. Ms. Moore was extremely concerned about Mr. Siaki’s health and safety. Ms. Moore felt isolated because, following Mr. Siaki’s arrest, she was left alone with no idea when she would be able to see and communicate with him next. Upon Mr. Siaki’s arrival at the ACDF, he met with medical intake interviewers\n11\n\n\x0cCase 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB Document 1 Filed 11/23/11 USDC Colorado Page 12 of 21\nwho conducted a medical intake. As a result of ACSO’s failure to offer or provide Mr. Siaki with auxiliary aids and services for effective communication during his pre-trial services meeting, Mr. Siaki was denied effective communication with the interviewer. On information and belief, ACSO has never provided a qualified sign language interpreter to any deaf individual who has been detained at the ACDF.\n123. ACSO has no policies informing its employees and/or contractors about providing appropriate auxiliary aids and services to detainees who are deaf or hard of hearing.\n126. As a part of that purpose, CCDC seeks to ensure that individuals who are deaf and hard-of-hearing have access to -- and do not encounter discrimination in -- participating in government services, including services while encountering law enforcement officials, and while being arrested, booked, interrogated, and detained.\n129. CCDC engages in extensive outreach as well as advocacy and educational efforts to promote access for and combat discrimination against people with disabilities. Those injuries include, but are not limited to, those described herein.\n131. ACSO’s discrimination has been and continues to be a barrier to the full participation of persons with disabilities and, therefore, frustrates CCDC’s ability to achieve full inclusion for persons with disabilities. Defendant is a public entity within the meaning of the ADA. Plaintiff Moore is a qualified individual with a disability. Defendant has discriminated against Plaintiff Moore on the basis of her disability. In the absence of the injunction requested herein, Defendant will continue to\ndiscriminate against Plaintiff Siaki, Plaintiff Moore and CCDC, including its members, on the basis of disability in violation of Title II of the ADA and its implementing regulations.\n153. Such discrimination includes the failure to provide auxiliary aids and services in order to ensure effective communication.\n166. Deputy Keefer was aware that Mr. Siaki was deaf soon after their arrival. Mr. Siaki was denied access to effective communication by the deputies and, therefore, could not convey that he did not understand the Miranda form. Detention Specialist Moore also informed Ms. Moore that a restraining order had been automatically entered, restraining Mr. Siaki from having contact with Ms. Moore.\n106. Upon Mr. Siaki’s arrival at the ACDF, he met with medical intake interviewers who conducted a medical intake. For the entirety of his detention at the ACDF, Mr. Owen attempted to\ncommunicate that he is deaf so that ACSO Personnel would provide a sign language interpreter, but Defendant’s Personnel did not offer or provide him with a sign language interpreter.\n138.

JC-MA-0019,"COVID-19 Summary: On April 17, 2020, individuals detained in the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (PCCF) filed this putative class action complaint addressing safety concerns posed by COVID-19. The plaintiffs sought emergency risk-mitigation procedures and release measures to reduce the population at the PCCF.  On May 18, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss and the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal on October 8, 2020. <hr>

On April 17, 2020, federal detainees at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (PCCF) filed this putative class action complaint at the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, addressing safety concerns posed by COVID-19. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and as an injunctive and declaratory action under 28 U.S.C. § 2201. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that conditions of confinement lacked reasonable preventative measures in response to the heightened health risks from COVID-19, in violation of their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. They pointed to ongoing failures by the defendant to comply with basic safety measures under the interim guidelines provided for correctional facilities by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including its social distancing requirement. The plaintiffs sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), declaratory and injunctive relief, and a writ of habeas corpus ordering immediate action to reduce the population at the PCCF and institute proper hygienic measures, with an independent monitor to ensure compliance. Concurrently, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that all federal detainees held or to be held by the PCCF be granted class certification. The case was assigned to Judge Leo T. Sorokin. 

On April 20, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the consideration of the proposed class certification, or a two-week extension to file a response to the motion for class certification in the alternative. The court granted the motion on the same day. 

The next day, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, as there were no cases of COVID-19 in PCCF in the detainee population as of April 20, and the petitioners did not have underlying medical conditions. A second motion was filed on April 24, further submitting that the requested remedies by the plaintiffs involved a challenge to the fact or duration of their confinement, outside of the writ of habeas. 

The defendant submitted a status report confirming three cases of COVID-19 among employees on April 29. A hearing was held the next day.

On May 1, the court ordered the defendant to answer a list of questions addressing disputed factual questions and unclear matters by May 6. Questions include housing arrangements of the proposed class, policies governing face masks, testing capacity in the PCCF, as well as the respondents’ response to the three confirmed cases of COVID-19. The defendants submitted a status report confirming two additional cases of COVID-19 among employees on May 5, and report of one additional case on May 12. 

On May 18, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs' claims fell within the scope of a habeas petition and that the plaintiffs’ failure to satisfy the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement is not grounds for dismissal. The court also denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction because they failed to meet their burden of establishing that they were likely to succeed in showing that the defendant had been deliberately indifferent to the risk of COVID-19. The court further ordered that the parties file a joint status report regarding how the matter should proceed, and ordered the defendant to file a status report explaining whether and how PCCF is expanding its testing in line with the institution-wide testing occurring in DOC facilities and its reasoning by May 27. 

On May 27, the defendants reported that they did not plan to institute institution-wide testing occurring in DOC facilities because it was the medical opinion of PCCF’s medical director that such measures were not warranted at PCCF in the present circumstances. 

According to the latest status report on June 2, one employee at PCCF tested positive. 28 detainees were tested with two results coming back positive. 

According to the June 24 status report, 53 individuals at PCCF were tested, with two positive results from pretrial detainees and one from a former detainee who tested positive following his release. 

The plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal on October 8, 2020.","ﬁled by JONATHAN BERMUDEZ, Anthony Baez, Jermaine Gonsalves, Dedrick Lindsey. ( There is one toilet in the cell that is shared by all five men. Inmates have four hours of recreation per day. Moreover, population turnover means that people cycle between facilities and communities. And people often need to be transported to and from facilities, including for disciplinary and/or quarantining purposes. This is because most correctional facilities lack the equipment needed to treat serious COVID-19 cases, such as ventilators. Not all strategies will be feasible in all facilities. Ensure that materials are understandable for non-English speakers and those with low literacy.\n√ Promote non-contact visits: ο Encourage incarcerated/detained persons to limit contact visits in the interest of their own health and the health of their visitors. See above suggestions for promoting non-contact visits.\n√ Restrict non-essential vendors, volunteers, and tours from entering the facility.\nManagement\nIf there has been a suspected COVID-19 case inside the facility (among incarcerated/detained persons, staff, or visitors who have recently been inside), begin implementing Management strategies while test results are pending. ο When a COVID-19 case is suspected or confirmed, work with public health to identify close contacts who should be placed under quarantine. Employ social distancing strategies related to housing in the Prevention section above. If permissible, consider using a bag liner that is either disposable or can be laundered.\n√ Consult cleaning recommendations above to ensure that transport vehicles are thoroughly cleaned after carrying a confirmed or suspected COVID-19 case.\nQuarantining Close Contacts of COVID-19 Cases\nNOTE: Some recommendations below apply primarily to facilities with onsite healthcare capacity. Monitor linked CDC guidelines in Table 1 for updates to recommended PPE.\n√ Keep recommended PPE near the spaces in the facility where it could be needed, to facilitate quick access in an emergency.\n√ Recommended PPE for incarcerated/detained individuals and staff in a correctional facility will vary based on the type of contact they have with COVID-19 cases and their contacts (see Table 1). Clean and disinfect duty belt and gear prior to reuse using a household cleaning spray or wipe, according to the product label.\n\x83 If there are shortages of gowns, they should be prioritized for aerosol-generating procedures, care activities where splashes and sprays are anticipated, and high-contact patient care activities that provide opportunities for transfer of pathogens to the hands and clothing of staff.\n√ Note that shortages of all PPE categories are anticipated during the COVID-19 response, particularly for non-healthcare workers. Mr. Gonsalves stated that he is housed in a cell with one other inmate. Mr. Baptista did not observe any changes made within the unit regarding increased hygiene or social distancing after the COVID19 pandemic began, other than a sign which instructed to report someone with COVID-19 symptoms to a correctional officer so that the correctional officer could hand out masks.\n10.

FA-IL-0016,"On March 30, 2017, an organization called Tent City Alternative to LSD Viaducts and a community resident activist submitted a Notification of Public Assembly to the City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings. They requested a permit to erect tents on behalf of the homeless population, who would be displaced by construction. The City granted a permit as to the location for the duration sought, but without a provision that would allow the erection of tents. On May 17, the plaintiffs responded by filing a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County.  

On June 15, 2017, the defendant City of Chicago removed the action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The case was assigned to Judge Sidney Schenkier. In September, the court granted a motion to change the name of the plaintiffs to The Uptown Tent City Organizers. The Uptown Tent City Organizers is an unincorporated association of community members, some of whom reside in tents under the viaducts near Lake Shore Drive. 

On August 1, the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 against the Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings, Chicago Department of Transportation, and City of Chicago. The first amended complaint claimed that denial of the permit to erect tents violated the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights to public assembly, Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment, and rights under state law. The plaintiffs sought a reversal of the city's decision to deny the permit (granting the application for an assembly permit to run for a period of six months), declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees and costs.

On August 27, the plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction to prevent the construction work from occurring that would displace the homeless community. On September 15, Judge Sidney I. Schenkier denied the motion on the basis that the government did not have the constitutional obligation to provide individuals with a place to live and the community did not have a contractual right to live under the viaducts.

On November 7, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint to add federal constitutional violations under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and a state claim of violation of the Illinois Homeless Act. The amended complaint included details of events that precipitated in September between the plaintiffs and local law enforcement. The plaintiffs again sought a reversal of the administrative hearing decision to deny the permits, declaratory relief, a permanent injunction, and attorney's fees and costs. 

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on January 19, 2018. Judge Schenkier granted this motion and dismissed the case with prejudice on June 5, 2018. The court held that the organization lacked standing because it failed to allege that any of its members would be personally harmed by the City's conduct. And the court dismissed the individual plaintiff's First Amendment claim because the plaintiff had not alleged that the proposed conduct would be expressive. Finally, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. 2018 WL 2709431.

In addition to needing safe shelter, the Plaintiffs sought to erect tents in an area that is highly visible to people frequenting the businesses in the Uptown community to draw attention to the lack of affordable housing options and the lack of services available for people experiencing homelessness.\n17. She stated that MCM’s permit was “illegal” and that the City had forced MCM to remove the fencing and “no trespassing” signs blocking the Stewart Mall. The next day, Thayer sent another email to the Department of Administrative Hearings requesting a new appeals hearing, which was granted and set for March 30, 2017. Prior to the March 30 hearing, the fences around the mall were again taken down. On information and belief, significant numbers of public assemblies include the erection of non-permanent structures as part of the assembly that are dismantled at the end of the assembly. constitutes an express municipal policy of the City. Such policy subjects the homeless to citations for ordinance violations and possible arrest.\n38. Plaintiffs lack any adequate remedy at law. The denial of Plaintiffs’ motion was arbitrary resulting in prejudice to the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing.\n49. Denial of presenting background information on the public assembly ordinance deprived Plaintiffs of entering such information in the record for purposes of making arguments of violations of the U.S. Constitution in subsequent proceedings.\n56. ALJ Lombardo denied Plaintiffs’ objection on grounds of relevancy to questions on cross-examination of Plaintiff Thayer whether he had asked Chicago officials, prior to submitting the notification for public assembly, if the City of Chicago was willing to house 40 homeless people. Plaintiffs objected that notification for a public assembly does not require other inquiries of city officials. This arbitrary overruling of Plaintiffs’ objection resulted in prejudice to the Plaintiffs and an unfair hearing.\n69. The parties are able to agree upon an alternative location that both provides a safe place for Plaintiffs and others affected by the removal notice to stay, and has similar visibility to the current viaduct site and/or the Stewart School site.\nAs set forth below, Plaintiffs meet the criteria for obtaining preliminary injunctive relief to bar the City from enforcing its 30-day notice. Ty, Inc. v. Jones Group, Inc., 237 F.3d 891, 895 (7th Cir. Under this analysis, if sufficient evidence is\n7\n\n\x0cCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 25 Filed: 08/27/17 Page 8 of 33 PageID #:503\npresented showing that the prohibited conduct was involuntary due to one’s status, criminalization of that conduct would be impermissible under the Eighth Amendment. The City’s denial of plaintiffs’ permit application thus deprives plaintiffs of their right to speak in an effective manner, a right protected by the First Amendment.\nUnder established case law, public authorities may limit the application of the public assembly provision of the 1st Amendment of the U.S. Constitution on the grounds of “time” “place” and “manner.” Notably, in denying the second public assembly permit, the City did not cite any safety issues.\n35. Nothing in the language of MCC §10-8-334 prohibits the erection of non-\npermanent structures as part of a public assembly. On the afternoon of September 17, 2017, the 20-25 homeless residents\nand many housed UTCO members spent approximately 4-5 hours moving everyone’s tents and other belongings to relocate the protest encampment to a grassy strip west of the Wilson Avenue viaduct, between the southbound exit ramp of Lake Shore Drive at Wilson and the intersection of Wilson Avenue and North Marine Drive. When asked if people could move one block west out of the permitted area and be left alone, officer #66 said they would have to check the permit. Officer #66 walked up to the first tent in the line and unzipped the tent to look inside. Around 12:15 AM on the morning of September 19, 2017, an unknown police officer told a man in a sleeping bag at the park that he would be ticketed if he did not move. Yet, this was not\n14\n\n\x0cCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 48 Filed: 11/07/17 Page 15 of 37 PageID #:735\na viable option for many of the homeless residents there because: a. Homeless individuals without funds are stranded in the neighborhood of the Pacific Garden Mission without the means to return to their neighborhoods where they have access to social services and medical care; b. Pacific Garden Mission’s barracks environment is incompatible with those individuals with post-traumatic stress syndrome (PTSD) from military service. Later, on the night of September 19, 2017, police officer John Doe approached Plaintiff Andy Thayer and other UTCO members and stated that the police would find out who the owner was, but that they couldn’t evict the tent city that night.\n69. Even though ALJ Lombardo denied the Motion to Dismiss (T. P 15, L 13), the denial of Plaintiffs’ motion for a continuance denied Plaintiffs’ the ability to submit a memorandum of law which would be included as part of the record. Soldal v. Cook County, 506 U.S. 56 (1992). Though this Court has not specifically held that an individual living in a tent has an expectation of privacy in the tent of its contents, several other Courts have found an individual does have an expectation of privacy in a tent which served as a residence. Plaintiffs reallege as if they were set forth in full herein all allegations set forth in paragraphs 1–148. 54.\n\n\x0cCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 2 of 6 PageID #:1048\nhomeless individuals who were staying at the viaducts, Plaintiffs sought the City’s approval to hold a public assembly at Stewart Mall for a period of nearly seven months – 24 hours a day – to include erecting tents where homeless individuals would reside. However, Plaintiffs were granted the right to assemble at Stewart Mall for the entire time period they requested, just without the ability to erect tents.\n2. After the City removed Plaintiffs’ administrative review claim to federal court, Plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint re-asserting their administrative review claim, and adding new claims under the First and Eighth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution, and a state law claim under the Illinois Bill of Rights for the Homeless Act.\n3. Further, Plaintiffs have not established that any actions\n4\n\n\x0cCase: 1:17-cv-04518 Document #: 56 Filed: 01/19/18 Page 5 of 6 PageID #:1051\nwere taken pursuant to a City policy, as required by Monell. This claim fails because neither Plaintiff has claimed that their property was taken. Further, Plaintiffs have not established that any actions were taken pursuant to a City policy, as required by Monell. Plaintiffs have not made the required showing that a property owner has been denied compensation for any property taken.

EE-AZ-0009,"On March 30, 2006, the Phoenix District Office of the EEOC filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiff sued the automobile repairer AutoZone, Inc. under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiff, representing a female employee of AutoZone Inc., asked the court for monetary relief for the complainant and injunctive relief enjoining the defendant from future discrimination on the basis of sex. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that her manager at AutoZone Inc. had sexually harassed her, and that her employer had retaliated against her when she complained of the sexual harassment. 

On June 5, 2008 Judge Stephen M McNamee granted the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment with regard to the defendant's affirmative defense. AutoZone Inc. had argued as an affirmative defense that the complainant's previous conviction of disorderly conduct would have constituted termination regardless of her sexual harassment complaints. The Court found this defense lacked sufficient evidence and was merely speculation. AutoZone Inc. further argued an affirmative defense that punitive damages in this case were a violation of the state and federal constitution. Judge McNamee found this affirmative defense erroneous. 

On September 11, 2008 Judge Stephen M McNamee denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. Judge McNamee ruled that material questions remained with regard to the sexual harassment, the plaintiff's actions following the sexual harassment, and whether the complainant was retaliated against after she filed complaints of sexual harassment. Given these remaining questions, summary judgement was inappropriate. 

The parties then disputed jury instruction. On December 11, 2008, the EEOC provided proposed jury instructions. The defendant claimed that the instructions were incorrect because the plaintiff had not pled that tangible employment action occurred in retaliation to her complaint. On June 1, 2009, Judge McNamee found the instructions proper. The model instructions direct the jury to find whether or not the complainant proved she had suffered a tangible employment action. If found, the defendant was vicariously liable for the manager's conduct, and the defendant's affirmative defense would not be considered. 

On June 10, 2009, a jury found for the plaintiff. The jury found that the plaintiff did experience a hostile work environment, but also found that AutoZone Inc. did not retaliate against the complainant. The jury found AutoZone Inc. liable to the complainant for $15,000 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in punitive damages. 

On June 22, 2009 the defendant moved for a judgment as a matter of law, or alliteratively, a new trial.  On July 24, 2009 Judge McNamee found that there was legally sufficient evidence for the jury finding, and there was not mistake in the case. He denied both motions. 

On June 25, 2009, the EEOC moved to amend the judgment to include equitable relief. On November 9, 2009, Judge McNamee partially granted the EEOC's motion. He granted requests to require training programs, and he granted the request to require updated posters with specific information about Title VII and a complaint process. He denied the motion for a permanent injunction enjoining the defendant from discriminating against employees based on sex because the complainant in this case was the only to come forward with a complaint, and because AutoZone had sufficiently shown that sexual harassment was unlikely to reoccur. He also denied relief requiring the defendant to investigate all employee complaints of sexual harassment from the last three years, relief requiring the defendant to change its complaint process, and relief requiring monitoring and reporting. 

The Defendant then moved for partial reconsideration with regard to new postings on Title VII. One January 6, 2010, Judge McNamee ordered that the original posters may be used as a foundation, but he found three problems that must be corrected. The posters must be updated, they must include EEOC contact information for the Phoenix Field Office, and they must be moved further from the manager's offices. 

On July 23, 2012, Judge McNamee found that the defendant had paid the ordered monetary damages, so he ordered that the bond securing judgment could be released.

PB-CA-0048,"On October 16, 2014, three individuals with significant physical disabilities requiring substantial medical care filed this lawsuit against the California Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs alleged that the state had violated Section II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which require public entities to provide services to persons with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and to prevent unnecessary institutionalization. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing DHCS from reducing at-home medical care and support for the plaintiffs, and a permanent injunction preventing unnecessary institutionalization in the future. They also sought attorney’s fees. The plaintiffs were represented by Disability Rights California.

At the time, the plaintiffs, who were once institutionalized because of their disabilities, were living in their own homes where they received Medicaid-funded nursing and attendant care through the California Medi-Cal Home and Community Based Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver Program (“Waiver Program”). They alleged that they were at risk of institutionalization because DHCS maintained unnecessarily low cost limits for these services.

On January 29, 2015, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. The amended complaint added an organizational plaintiff, In Spirit, a non-profit organization that provided financial assistance to persons with disabilities to receive medical care in their home. 
 
On July 7, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. This complaint added a new named plaintiff, dismissed one of the existing named plaintiffs, elaborated on the factual allegations, and added a third claim for violations of California state law. On September 23, 2015, In Spirit was voluntarily dismissed as a party in the lawsuit. 

On January 26, 2016, the parties held a mediation session but were unable to reach an agreement. Throughout the mediation, the parties continued to engage in discovery. On March 8, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. On March 10, 2016, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgement. District Judge Fernando Olguin denied both motions on April 27, 2016. He further set out deadlines for continued discovery.
 
On March 29, 2016, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division (""DOJ"") filed a statement of interest to clarify the defendant’s obligations under the ADA. The DOJ explained that the ADA prohibits unjustified institutionalization and requires individuals with disabilities receive support and services in the most integrated setting as mandated in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). The DOJ also clarified that the defendants could not administer the Medicaid waiver without accounting for individual needs and that the integration mandate protects individuals at serious risk of institutionalization. The DOJ filed subsequent statements of interest on August 4, 2016 and September 16, 2016, which further clarified the states’ ADA obligations in light of DHCS’s arguments against the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgement.

On July 18, 2016, the plaintiffs again moved for summary judgement, which Judge Olguin denied on August 4, 2016 due to continued factual disputes. Judge Olguin also noted being “deeply troubled” by the defendants’ repeated failure to comply in good faith with discovery requests and threatened to impose sanctions.

On September 7, 2016, the plaintiffs again filed a motion for summary judgement. On June 5, 2017, the Court denied that motion, finding that genuine issues of material fact remained regarding whether or not the California waiver program’s cost limits created a serious risk of institutionalization and whether California had an existing deinstitutionalization scheme in place that was effective. 385 F. Supp. 3d 1048. 

The parties continued with discovery, and it appears they continued engaging in settlement talks as well. On March 14, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss their case without prejudice, and on March 19, 2018, the court granted this motion for voluntary dismissal of most of the case. There was some continued litigation over whether the plaintiffs were entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. 

The dismissal seems to come from the fact that DHCS eventually changed the waiver application process so that decisions would be based on medical necessity without any mention of cost limits. In their motion opposing attorneys’ fees, the defendants asserted that this made the plaintiffs' claims moot, and that there was no basis for awarding attorneys’ fees or costs. The plaintiffs argued that the overall course of events demonstrated that this litigation was a significant factor prompting defendants to eliminate waiver cost limits, which created a presumption that plaintiffs were a catalyst and, because defendants could not rebut that presumption, plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys fees’ and costs under a state statute. 

On May 30, 2019, Judge Olguin granted the plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys fees. The court found that the litigation led to the elimination of DHCS’s cost limits, conferring a significant benefit for potentially thousands of people. The elimination of cost limits would ensure that participants would not have to resort to litigation to secure needed services and that they would be able to remain in their homes and avoid segregation and isolation. The court ordered the plaintiffs to file their motion for attorneys’ fees and costs no later than July 31, 2019. 2019 WL 2590170. 

After a brief delay, the parties agreed on how much the defendants should pay in attorneys’ fees. They notified the court that they had resolved all outstanding issues in this case on November 22, 2019. The notification did not state the size of the award, so the Clearinghouse is unaware of the amount. The case is now closed.

( In March 2002, Mr. Congdon was named one of five winners nationally\n\n14 of the Recording for the Blind and Dyslexic academic awards. Mr. Congdon is medically fragile and technology dependent. His\n\n9 primary care doctor, who also handles his pulmonary care, is with the Family\n\n10 Medicine Center in Glendale and treats Mr. Congdon in his home. As set forth in his Plan of Treatment approved by his physician, Mr.\n\n20 Benison has frequent, ongoing, and unpredictable skilled care needs that must be\n\n21 addressed by a licensed nurse. Defendant’s denial and reduction of adequate and necessary in-home\n\n24 nursing and refusal to provide NF/AH Waiver services has barred Plaintiffs from\n\n25 receiving the services they need to continue to live in the community, thereby\n\n26 placing them at imminent risk of institutionalization in violation of Section 504’s\n\n27 integration mandate.\n\n28\n\n119. Plaintiff\n\n8 Palomares needs, among other things, nursing care to manage his complicated\n\n9 catheter care, and monitor and assess his unstable and unpredictable health\n\n10 conditions; additional attendant hours so that he can be repositioned and cared for\n\n11 more frequently to prevent health crises; and reinstatement of RN case management.\n\n12 Plaintiff Benison, who lives alone, also requires Case Management and Habilitation\n\n13 services, which are available under the NF/AH Waiver.\n\n14\n\n5. 42 U.S.C. § 1396n(c)(1) (2010).\n\n17\n\n34. ”\n\n14 28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(8) (2010); see also parallel Section 504 regulations, 45 C.F.R.\n\n15 § 84.4(b)(1)(iv) (2005).\n\n16\n\n57.

Mr. Benison had a severe attack of pneumonia and was\n\n16 hospitalized at the Goleta Valley Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara. He cannot\n\n26 feed himself and has limited use of his hands. Since moving home in 2006, Mr. Palomares has been hospitalized\n\n24 several times.

CJ-OK-0004,"On July 20, 2005, two death-sentenced inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Oklahoma Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.  Anderson and Taylor complained to the Court that the lethal injection procedure used by the defendants during executions violated the Constitution by inflicting enormous amounts of pain on the executed prisoner.  Specifically, they claimed that the defendants 1) violated medically approved procedures by failing to employ properly trained people to inject the anesthesia, 2) arbitrarily and unnecessarily used drugs and drug dosages that created significant risks that the condemned prisoner would suffer unnecessary pain, 3) used a sequence of drug administration that delays administration of the anesthetic until after the prisoner is dead, 4) delivered the drugs through alternating IV lines, impairing control over the timing and sequence of drug delivery and increasing the risk of drug administration failure.  Due to these concerns, the plaintiffs asked the Court to stay their executions and to enjoin the defendants from using the lethal injection procedure that they normally used.  

On August 15, 2005, the case was referred to Magistrage Judge Bacharach.  On September 6, 2005, the defendants asked the Court to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the Anderson and Taylor had failed to show any likelihood that their claim would succeed at trial.  On December 20, 2005, Judge Bacharach filed a report stating that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that they had a viable claim and recommending that the District Court should overrule the defendants' motion to dismiss.  On January 11, 2006, the District Court (Judge Stephen P. Friot) adopted the Magistrate's recommendation and overruled the motion to dismiss.  Anderson v. Evans, 2006 WL 83093 (W.D.Okla. Jan. 11, 2006).

On December 19, 2006, the parties initiated a settlement conference and sought asistance from the court.  On February 22, 2007, the parties held their settlement conference with Magistrate Judge Doyle Argo. On March 6, 2007, the parties entered a joint motion asking the District Court to stay the case and place it in abeyance for a period of one year.  We're not sure exactly why the defendants agreed to put off the case for a year, but their motion mentions ""recent developments in Plaintiff Anderson's habeas case"" and states that neither of the plaintiffs would ""face execution during the abeyance period, or for some time thereafter.""  The District Court agreed to place the lawsuit on hold for a year.  

On June 19, 2007, Plaintiff Anderson asked the Court to allow him to withdraw from the case.  Apparently, he had been re-sentenced to life in prison without parole, so he was no longer facing execution.  On July 10, 2007, the District Court (Judge Friot) allowed Anderson to withdraw from the case, and the case was renamed ""Taylor v. Jones.""  

On June 8, 2009 the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma dismissed the case without prejudice because the remaining named defendant lacked standing.  The District Court held that ""the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's denial of the plaintiff's writ of habeas corpus and remanded with instructions to grant the writ as to his conviction and execution subject to the State's right to re-try the case within a reasonable time."" Accordingly, the District Court found that the issue was moot as to Plaintiff Taylor, which called for a dismissal of the case. 

The Docket shows that the case was terminated as of June 8, 2009.

","CIV ___________________ COMPLAINT\n\nCOMPLAINT I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Mr. Taylor is held at H-Unit of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary at P.O. Box 97, McAlester, Oklahoma, 745020097. Robyn Parks was executed by the State of Oklahoma on Tuesday, March 10, 1992. Administration of IV anesthesia requires proficiency at achieving and maintaining IV access. If a 9\n\n\x0cCase 5:05-cv-00825-F Document 1 Filed 07/20/2005 Page 10 of 21\ncatheter is incorrectly placed, the drugs flowing through the IV lines can infiltrate the tissue surrounding the catheter rather than correctly entering the vein. ( g) The ODOC has failed to specify who has performed these procedures in the past (and there has been at least one central line venous access performed) or who will perform them in the future, if necessary, and failed to guarantee that those performing such measures will have the requisite training to protect condemned inmates from the unnecessary pain caused by these procedures if they are not performed in the appropriate manner. ( On information and belief, the ODOC protocol does not require any person to monitor the plane of anesthesia during execution. The AVMA never permits the use of neuromuscular blocking agents in combination with barbiturate anesthetics. While a certain potassium level is important for normal cardiac electrical activity, a rapid increase in blood concentration of potassium causes cardiac arrest. The American Veterinary Medical Association is so confident that death by Potassium Chloride will cause unnecessary suffering that it prohibits its use as a euthanasia agent unless the practitioner administering the Potassium Chloride has the skill and training to assure that the subject to be euthanized has reached a surgical plane of anesthesia. The Oklahoma statute does not require the administration of Potassium Chloride and the ODOC has arbitrarily and needlessly added Potassium Chloride (which is universally acknowledged to be painful) to the protocol when alternative drugs would serve the statutory function of a paralytic agent.\nc. Untrained personnel, the drugs selected, and the order of drug administration, each add to the risk of flawed executions in which prisoners consciously suffer pain. D.

From the initial injection of Thiopental, the entire process takes but a few minutes.\nPlaintiffs bring the present case under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, asserting violations of their right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment, and their right to be free from arbitrary and capricious procedures under the Fifth Amendment. ( However, Plaintiffs’ Complaint is insufficient to state a claim under 42 U.S.C. §1 983, and should be dismissed in its entirety insofar as it relates to Defendants Evans and Mullin.\nARGUMENT AND AUTHORITY LEGAL STANDARD\nA motion to dismiss is properly granted when it appears from the face of the Complaint, that the plaintiff can prove no set of facts entitling it to relief.

PLAINTIFFS MAY NOT PURSUE A CLAIM UNDER 42 U.S.C. § 1983 WHICH REPRESENTS MERELY A DIFFERENCE OF MEDICAL OPINION.\nStripped of its emotional and ideological context, execution by lethal injection is a medical procedure.

After addressing the history and treatment of the standard, the Court finally held:\n[A] prison official cannot be found liable under the Eighth Amendment for denying an inmate humane conditions of confinement unless the official knows of and disregards an excessive risk to inmate health or safety; the official must both be aware of facts from which the inference could be drawn that a substantial risk of serious harm exists, and he must also draw the inference.

FA-MI-0019,"On May 8, 2018, Speech First, a nationwide membership organization of students, alumni, and others concerned with preserving the protections of the First Amendment, filed this lawsuit, on behalf of members attending the University of Michigan, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiff sued the University of Michigan under 42 U.S.C.§ 1983 and 1988. Represented by private counsel, Speech First sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees, claiming violations of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The plaintiff alleged that the University of Michigan’s policies and enforcement of those policies chilled the speech and expression of student claimants. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that University’s policies on “harassment” and “bullying” were unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. Furthermore, the plaintiff alleged that the policies provided no notice to students on what would constitute “harassment” or “bullying,” and enforcement of the policies were implemented arbitrarily. 2018 WL 2123702. This case was assigned to Judge Elizabeth Stafford. 

On May 11, 2018, Speech First moved for preliminary injunctions against the defendant. The plaintiff sought to prohibit the defendant from: “(1)  taking any actions to investigate, threaten, or punish students for violations of the prohibitions on “harassment,” “bullying,” and “bias-related misconduct” set forth in the University’s Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities; and (2) using the Bias Response Team to investigate, threaten, or punish students (including informal punishments such as restorative justice or individual education) for bias incidents. On June 11, 2018, the United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.

In response, the defendant moved for a stay on its obligation to respond to the plaintiff’s complaint. The defendant argued that the University’s answer should be stayed until the court made a decision on the plaintiff’s preliminary injunction. Although the court noted that the defendant’s request served the interest of efficiency, it did not stay the defendant's answer. Instead, on June 19, 2018, the court extended the deadline until twenty-one (21) days from the date the court ruled on the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.

The court held a hearing on Speech First's motion for preliminary injunction on July 31, 2018. On August 6, the court denied the plaintiff's motion, holding that the Bias Response Team did not pose a concrete threat to the plaintiffs; that Speech First's constitutional challenge to the University's definitions of ""bullying"" and ""harassment"" had become moot after the University changed the definitions; and that there was no threat of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. The district determined that Speech First was not likely to succeed on the merits of its claims because it lacked standing to assert that claim.

The plaintiff appealed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on August 13, 2018. The Appeals Court found that Speech First had associational standing to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the students of the University. The Appeals Court also found that the claims were not moot, as the University’s voluntary cessation would not preclude them from reverting back to the prior definitions of ""bullying"" and ""harassment."" The Court vacated and remanded the District’s Court decision, determining that the District Court was in a better position to assess the facts. 939 F.3d 756 (6th Cir. 2019).

The parties agreed to settle the dispute, and each bore their own costs. The University agreed not to reinstate the Bias Response team or the prior definitions of bullying and harassment and to maintain the published definitions on the website as they were at the time of settlement. On October 28, 2019, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case. Judge Linda Parker order the dismissal with prejudice. The case is now closed.","RON WEISER, ERIK WESSEL, KATHERINE E. WHITE.

All of those concepts, as the University interprets and applies them, can capture staggering amounts of protected speech and expression. Under this regime, the most sensitive student on campus effectively dictates the terms under which others may speak. Cardona is sued in his official capacity.\n14. In other words, a student may violate the University’s prohibition on so-called “harassment” if he or she engages in “verbal[]” conduct (i.e., speech) that another student perceives as being “demeaning,” “bothersome,” or “annoying. Student A believes that #Blacklivesmatter might have once been a good idea, but has devolved into a hateful group that promotes racial division. Student A believes in a race-neutral society in which people receive neither preferences nor penalties based on the color of their skin. Student B believes passionately in the Second Amendment. In both cases, however, Student C refrains from voicing his views due to a credible fear that he will be accused of racism or sexism and reported to the bias response team.\n124. Student C wants to engage in open and robust intellectual debate with his fellow students about his beliefs in the classroom, online, in University housing, in other areas of the campus, and in the city of Ann Arbor.\n128. Speet v. Schuette, 726 F.3d 867, 872 (6th Cir. Plaintiff repeats and realleges each of the foregoing allegations in this Complaint. The definitions of “bias” and “bias incident,” as enforced by the University’s Bias Response Team, are unconstitutionally overbroad because a\n- 42 -\n\n\x0c4:18-cv-11451-LVP-EAS Doc # 1 Filed 05/08/18 Pg 43 of 50 Pg ID 43\nsubstantial number of instances exist in which those prohibitions cannot be applied consistent with the First Amendment.\n158. ”\n- 43 -\n\n\x0c4:18-cv-11451-LVP-EAS Doc # 1 Filed 05/08/18 Pg 44 of 50 Pg ID 44\n161. Moreover, even apart from any formal or informal sanctions at the end of the BRT process, the mere threat of being investigated by the BRT (which includes university officials and law enforcement officers) for alleged incidents of bias will cause many students to err on the side of caution before expressing an opinion that could cause someone to take offense. 14 filed 06/11/18 PageID.304 Page 3 of 31\n\nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES\n\nCASES:\n\nPAGE\n\nBaggett v.

Speech First, however, fails to demonstrate that the BRT poses anything but a “subjective chill” on students’ free speech rights.\nSpeech First asserts in its Complaint that the BRT “is tasked with investigating and punishing” individuals who engage in biased behavior.

NS-CA-0008,"On February 28, 2006, Al-Haramain Oregon (a non-profit organization) and two of its attorneys filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812 against the U.S. Government. The plaintiffs asked the court for injunctive relief and damages, claiming that the government violated FISA by conducting warrantless electronic surveillance of their communications. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the government's actions violated the separation of powers, the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 

On September 7, 2006, Judge Garr M. King denied the government's motion to dismiss but granted its motion to prevent access to a sealed classified document that had been inadvertently released to plaintiffs. Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Bush, 451 F. Supp. 2d 1215 (D. Or. 2006). The plaintiffs appealed. 

In January, 2007, the Multi District Litigation (MDL) Panel transferred the case to the Northern District of California, as part of a multi-district litigation consolidation, In Re National Security Agency Telecommunications Records Litigation,  <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13881"">NS-CA-11</a>, in this Clearinghouse. On April 30, 2007, the Ninth Circuit officially consolidated the plaintiffs' appeal with with Hepting v. AT & T, <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12825"">NS-CA-0004</a>, in this Clearinghouse. However, on November 16, 2007, the Ninth Circuit severed the two cases from each other and ordered that the cases would no longer be consolidated for any purpose. Hepting v. AT & T, 508 F.3d 898, 899 (9th Cir. 2007). 

On November 16, 2007, the Ninth Circuit issued a second opinion specifically addressing the appeal from this case, reversing and remanding the district court's order. Judge McKeown held that (1) state secrets privilege did not protect the subject matter of the plaintiffs' challenge; but (2) that privilege protected the sealed document the plaintiffs relied on; (3) the district court should not have permitted in camera review of affidavits attesting to the plaintiffs' attorneys' memories of the document; and (4) the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge without the sealed document. Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Bush, 507 F.3d 1190 (9th Cir. 2007).

Meanwhile, in January, 2007, the case was transferred to the Northern District of California, as part of a multi-district litigation consolidation.  On July 2, 2008, Judge Vaughn Walker of the Northern District of California held that FISA preempted the state secrets privilege with respect to foreign telecommunications surveillance. Judge Walker also held that the plaintiffs could not use a sealed classified document to establish their status as ""aggrieved persons"" within the meaning of FISA, but he also granted them leave to amend the complaint, which the plaintiffs did. In re Nat'l Sec. Agency Telecommunications Records Litig., 564 F. Supp. 2d 1109 (N.D. Cal. 2008).

On January 5, 2009, Judge Walker denied government motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. In re Nat'l Sec. Agency Telecommunications Records Litig., 595 F. Supp. 2d 1077 (N.D. Cal. 2009).  

On May 22, 2009, Judge Walker denied the government's third motion to dismiss and granted the plaintiffs' motion for discovery pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f). The order provided for plaintiffs' counsel to obtain top secret/sensitive compartmented information security clearances and ordered the government to review its classified submissions in this case and determine whether any could be declassified. In re Nat'l Sec. Agency Telecommunications Records Litig., MDL. 06-1791VRW, 2009 WL 1468792 (N.D. Cal. May 22, 2009).

On March 31, 2010, Judge Walker ordered entry of a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Judge Walker held that (1) the private remedy provision of FISA implicitly waived the government's sovereign immunity; (2) the prior mandate did not preclude plaintiffs from attempting to establish standing under FISA; (3) the defendants were equitably estopped from arguing that a valid FISA warrant existed; (4) the defendants violated FISA; and (5) the FBI director was not liable in his official capacity. In re Nat'l Sec. Agency Telecommunications Records Litig., 700 F. Supp. 2d 1182 (N.D. Cal. 2010). On December 22, 2010, Judge Walker awarded the plaintiffs about $2.5 million in attorneys' fees and about $41,000 to two of the three plaintiffs in liquidated damages. The defendants appealed. 

On December 5, 2012, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Writing for the Ninth Circuit, Judge McKeown held that (1) the government did not waive sovereign immunity under the civil liability provision of FISA, reversing the district court's order, and (2) the FBI director was not liable, affirming the district court's order. As a result, the Ninth Circuit dismissed all of the claims, ending the case. Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Obama, 705 F.3d 845 (9th Cir. 2012). This opinion amended and superseded the opinion from August 7, 2012, 690 F.3d 1089, which is almost identical to the amended opinion. The amended opinion simply omits a more detailed explanation of the procedures Congress required for certain sections of FISA (Section 2712(b)) where there was a waiver of sovereign immunity.","['Case 3:06-cv-00274-KI Document 1 Filed 02/28/06 Page 1 of 8 Page ID#: 1\n\nSteven Goldberg, OSB 75134 (goldberg@goldbergmechanic.com) 621 SW Morrison, Suite 1450 Portland, OR 97205 503.224.2372- Fax 503 224-1123\nThomas H.

VR-DC-1168,"On July 19, 2011, the state of Texas filed suit against the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The state asked for a declaratory judgment, alleging that the Department of Justice inappropriately declared Texas's new districting plan to be retrogressive (that is, discriminatory, because it diluted minority voting power). Arguments focused primarily on the demographics of the state of Texas and its new districting map. On November 8, 2011, the District Court (Judge Thomas Griffith) denied Texas's motion for summary judgment, holding that Texas improperly relied solely on demographic data in formulating its plans and that there were genuine issues of material fact. 831 F. Supp. 2d 244. 

On August 28, 2012, the District Court held that Texas had not met its burden of showing that the new U.S. Congressional and State House plans were not retrogressive or its burden of proving that its U.S. Congressional and State Senate plans were not enacted with a discriminatory purpose, and therefore denied declaratory judgment. 887 F. Supp. 2d 133. Texas sought review in the Supreme Court, and the case was held while the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act was under review in <I>Shelby County v. Holder</I>. 

On June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court held in the <I>Shelby County</I> case that the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional in part, striking down Section 4 of the Act, the ""coverage"" provision, which controlled which jurisdictions were obligated to seek DOJ preclearance of voting-related changes. 570 U.S. 529. The next day, the Court vacated the opinion in this case and remanded the case to the District Court for the District of Columbia. 570 U.S. 928.

On July 3, 2013, Texas moved to dismiss as moot all claims brought in its original complaint. It advanced two arguments in support of dismissal. First, on June 23, 2013, while Texas's appeal was pending and before the Supreme Court had announced its decision in <i>Shelby County</i>, the Texas legislature adopted a new set of redistricting plans that replaced those challenged in this case. Second, <i>Shelby County</i> (which held the VRA's coverage formula unconstitutional) had removed Texas from the preclearance regime of Section 5. Texas argued that these two factors had mooted it claims. On December 3, 2013, a three-judge panel for the District Court for the District of Columbia (Judge Thomas B. Griffith writing for the Court) agreed that the controversy had been mooted, and dismissed all claims. <a href=""http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/VR-DC-1168-0012.pdf"">Mem. & Order, Dec. 3, 2013</a>. 

On December 17, 2013, several parties (individual voters, elected state representatives, and civil rights advocacy groups) who had intervened as defendants earlier in the litigation moved for attorney fees and costs totaling $1,096,770.01. The intervenors argued that they were prevailing parties and thus entitled to fees and costs under the VRA-specifically, under § 1973l(e) of the VRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1973l(e), and subsection (b) of 42 U.S.C. § 1988. These sections allow courts to, at their discretion, award the prevailing party reasonable fees and costs if the underlying action was to enforce the voting guarantees of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

On June 18, 2014, the District Court (Judge Rosemary M. Collyer) granted the intervenors' motion for attorney fees and costs in full. <a href=""http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/VR-DC-1168-0013.pdf""><i>Texas v. United States</i>, Civil Action No. 11-1303 (RMC), 2014 WL 2758597, at *11 (D.D.C. June 18, 2014)</a>. Describing the issue as a ""case study in how not to respond to a motion for attorney fees and costs,"" <i>id.</i> at *1, Judge Rosemary chastised Texas for failing to respond (other than by means of a three-page ""Advisory"" filing) to the intervenors' motion. Finding that Texas's ""Advisory"" filing presented no substantive legal opposition, the Court thus granted the motion.

On July 16, 2014, Texas appealed the order granting attorney fees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The June 18 order was stayed pending this appeal. 

On August 18, 2015, the Judge Patricia A. Millett of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion affirming the District Court’s fee award. Judge Millett found that Texas failed to follow the District Court’s rules for responding to motions for attorneys’ fees and did not challenge the District Court’s use of its rules on appeal. Judge Millett proceeded to identify numerous flaws in Texas’ argument that the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Shelby County</i> made the intervenors ineligible for attorneys’ fees. Concluding that “Texas gets no second bite at the apple now” after its procedural missteps, Judge Millett affirmed the District Court’s fee award. 798 F.3d 1108. 

After the Court of Appeals issued its opinion, the intervenors moved for additional attorneys’ fees to cover the costs of appeal, and Texas failed to secure Supreme Court review. 136 S. Ct. 981. On March 17, 2016, the Court of Appeals remanded the intervenor’s motion for additional attorneys’ fees, now augmented by the costs of opposing Supreme Court review, to the District Court for fact-finding.

After almost a year of litigation over the additional attorneys’ fees, Judge Collyer issued an order and opinion granting the intervenors most of their requested fees on March 30, 2017. Judge Collyer noted that prevailing parties challenging voting plans or procedures are entitled to attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). The parties disputed whether undetermined fees should be calculated using the intervenors’ attorneys’ rates from private practice or the more conservative Laffey Matrix, a “commonly used” tool in the D.C. Circuit. Judge Collyer selected a generous form of the Laffey Matrix as most appropriate given the skill of the intervenors’ attorneys and the complexity of the litigation but reduced one fee award by 7.6 hours for work on a motion that was never filed. 

The case is now closed.

He testified that his analysis provided only the first steps in the more complicated inquiry this Court must undertake, refused to offer an opinion on the number of districts protected by section 5 in the existing and enacted plans, and stated he was not offering an answer to the question whether the enacted plans preserve the current degree of ability to elect. Yet where that standard is met — where minority voters themselves “pull, haul, and trade” to elect their preferred candidates, De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1020 — then the district is one in which minority voters have an ability to elect, and section 5’s\n24\n\n\x0csafeguards apply.18 B. Discriminatory Intent In Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board (Bossier II), 528 U.S. 320 (2000), the Supreme\nCourt considered whether section 5 barred a plan that “would have no retrogressive effect” but “nonetheless . . . 11:15-21, Jan. 24, 2012 AM.20\nTexas counters that none of the experts found that benchmark CD 23 clearly performs as an ability district and points to the weak showing of minority voters in exogenous elections: only three out of ten victories in the OAG 10 and two out of five victories in Dr. Handley’s election\n20 Texas argues that one of the two endogenous victories, the 2006 election, should be discounted because it did not occur on general election day. Thus, CD 23 is an ability district in the benchmark, but would be no longer in the enacted plan.\nTexas claims that the enacted district has remained functionally identical to the benchmark, but these claims are undermined by the mapdrawers’ own admissions that they tried to make the district more Republican — and consequently, less dependable for minoritypreferred candidates — without changing the district’s Hispanic population levels. The\nUnited States and various Intervenors argue that Texas was required to draw at least one of these\nnew districts as an ability district. The Texas legislature proposed substantial changes to these districts even though the 2010 Census data shows the population in each was already close to the ideal size.30 We have already determined that these changes are not retrogressive, but they raise serious concerns about what motivated the Congressional Plan.\nCongressman Al Green, who represents CD 9, testified that “substantial surgery” was done to his district that could not have happened by accident. The enacted plan also removed from CD 9 the area where Representative Green had established his district office. Here, where over 31% of the district’s population lives in split-VTD areas and where the mapdrawers’ stated goal was to peel off from the district strong Democratic areas — suggesting that the general concerns about skewed exogenous results from political variance within split VTDs may be especially strong in this district — Dr. Handley\n39 In Texas, VTDs are roughly equivalent to precincts elsewhere.\n56\n\n\x0cconcluded that the results of her exogenous analysis were not reliable forecasters of the district’s future voting strength. See Handley House Rep. 9-10.\nWe are not deaf to the concerns the United States raises, and we are skeptical of the State’s claim that high HCVAP is sufficient to prove continued ability status in light of the uncontested testimony that HD 41 was engineered to transform a reliable Democratic district into one that would elect a Republican instead. Thus, when our dissenting colleague “use[s] that same metric [namely, the difference between the real and projected voter turnout] —the only ground Dr. Alford gave as support for his critique — to test the data,” CD 25 Dissent, at 9 n.11, he may be missing the remaining “variety of technical things” referenced by Dr. Alford that were not fully developed in the record by the experts and that make this data insufficiently reliable for even Texas’ own expert to rely upon. 39:5-21, Jan. 25, 2012 AM.\n5\n\n\x0cdoes not figure into Dr. Ansolabehere’s calculations at all.6 Even more troubling, over half of\nTravis County lies outside CD 25, but is nonetheless included in the analysis. Even taking Dr. Ansolabehere’s calculations as accurate,8 this evidence is still\ninsufficient to conclude that CD 25 is a crossover district. 320, at 59 (Rep. of Dr. Arrington); Defs.’ 148, ¶ 8 (Chairman Solomons Pre-Filed Direct Testimony) (stating that the meetings with Congressman Green and Congresswoman Jackson Lee were “more of a ‘meet and greet,’ neither of the congresspersons provided me with any details requesting specific changes to their districts”).\nC.

In particular, after Mr. Opiela informed Mr. Interiano in the November 2010 email that data available at the block level could be used to lower a district’s turnout of voters with Spanish surnames while raising its total Hispanic population, Messrs. Interiano and Opiela requested SSVR data at the block level from the TLC. 771, Perez v. Perry, Sept. 8, 2011 (Saucedo)); Defs.’ Mr. Downton testified that he drew the map to keep the Hispanic population together, even though he also testified that these Hispanic populations may not want to be submerged into Denton County.

With the new plan, CD 30 will also.12 The United States agrees that the proposed Congressional Plan does not retrogress Black voting power, and appears to credit Texas with three (not just two) Black ability\n10 For example, Texas identified eight minority ability districts in the benchmark congressional plan while the United States identified ten. 12 Without explaining its relevance, Texas also points out that CD 9, which has a more than thirty percent but less than forty percent BVAP, will maintain that percentage under the proposed plan.\n17\n\n\x0ccongressional districts in the Congressional Plan. Due to alleged fracturing in these districts, the United States anticipates a loss of four to five minority ability districts, i.e., HDs 33, 35, 41, 117, and 149, in the State House Plan.\nAs noted, most Intervenors agree with the United States. P. 56(a); accord Anderson v. Liberty Lobby, Inc., 477 U.S. 242, 247 (1986); Talavera v. Shah, 638 F.3d 303, 308 (D.C. Cir. However, when there is no supermajority in a district, a Section\n5 analysis must go beyond mere population data to include factors such as minority voter\nregistration, minority voter turnout, election history, and minority/majority voting behaviors.23\nDetermining that minorities have an ability to elect based solely on their numbers\nin the voting population of a district cannot account for the most fundamental concern of Section\n5: the effect past discrimination has on current electoral power. In line with Beer and the language of Section 5, this Court finds that evidence of\npreventing an emerging ability to elect from crystallizing will not support the contention that a\nplan has an impermissible retrogressive effect under Section 5.\nFinally, Texas argues that the United States’ analysis of retrogression, reflected in\nthe 2011 DOJ Guidance, is elusive and expensive. 248].\nWe agree with Texas that its claims were mooted by Shelby County and the adoption of superseding redistricting plans. Accordingly, the Supreme Court held that voluntary changes in conduct disassociated from judicial action are similar to a “reversal of a directed verdict,” a finding of constitutional infirmity “unaccompanied by judicial relief,” and other nonjudicial modifications of actual conditions, none of which permits recovery of attorney fees.8 Id. at 605-06 (internal quotations and citations omitted).\nSince Buckhannon, the D.C.

IM-CT-0009,"On February 13, 2012, the plaintiff filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in this §1983 class habeas action against the Connecticut Department of Corrections. The petition was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut and assigned to Judge Janet Bond Arteton. The plaintiffs were detainees in Connecticut Department of Corrections (CDOC) facilities who, after the expiration of the state-law basis of their detention, remained in state custody solely due to an administrative ""immigration detainer"" placed by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Represented by the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, the plaintiffs sought a writ of habeas corpus requiring the state to release them, an injunction against detaining future individuals based solely on an immigration detainer, and declaratory judgment invalidating such detention.

Detainers issued by ICE request state and local law enforcement officials to hold individuals in custody, without any basis in state law, for up to 48 hours, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §287.7. The named plaintiff's state-based detention ended on February 10, 2012; he filed the petition on February 13, 2012 when his subsequent detention continued for more than 48 hours.  On the same day, the plaintiff requested class certification of detainees similarly situated in CDOC facilities. Claiming they were detained without probable cause hearings,and that the detainer is an invalid commandeering of state officials, the plaintiff alleged violation of Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable seizure.  Additionally, the plaintiff asserted that Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process rights were violated because the state lacked a compelling interest to continue detention.

On February 19, 2013, the parties entered a proposed settlement agreement based on the newly enacted state regulations. The settlement agreement states that if an ICE immigration detainer is placed on a detainee, he or she will be notified by the CDOC as soon as practicable.  If the detainee's state-based detention has expired and the detainee does not have a prior order of removal or meet certain ""dangerousness criteria"" set forth in the statute, the detainee shall not be held. The statute allowed for only rare occasions where CDOC could use its discretion to continue detention. The court approved the settlement agreement on March 5, 2013.  

The settlement agreement was set to expire on February 2, 2017. On February 2, 2017, the parties jointly moved to extend the termination date of the settlement agreement from February 2, 2017 to February 2, 2018. The court ordered the modification of the settlement agreement to reflect the extension that day, and the settlement agreement remained otherwise unchanged. On January 19, 2018, the parties moved to extend the settlement agreement for another year, and on January 26, 2018, the court modified the agreement with a new termination date of February 2, 2019.

As of April 14, 2020, there are no further entries in the docket and the settlement is presumed to have lapsed.

PB-DC-0011,"On April 13, 2018, the Arab American Institute (“AAI”) sued the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) under the Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. § 552, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. AAI alleged that OMB violated FOIA by failing to disclose requested records pertaining to OMB’s decision not to include a combined race and ethnicity question or a Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) category on the 2020 Census. AAI asked the court to declare that OMB violated FOIA and to issue an injunction ordering the agency to release the requested records. This case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson. 

One month later, on May 18, 2018, the court ordered OMB to file a dispositive motion or a status report setting a schedule for OMB’s production of documents to AAI. OMB chose the latter, filing its first status report on June 15, 2018. Over the next two years, the parties filed several joint status reports detailing which documents OMB had disclosed to AAI and which documents were still outstanding or disputed. By May 13, 2020, OMB had reviewed approximately 2,000 potentially responsive documents, producing “a number” of them to AAI and withholding 161 of them, claiming they were FOIA exempt. AAI objected to the withholding of five of the allegedly exempt documents.

OMB filed a motion for summary judgment on February 10, 2020, arguing that the five disputed documents were exempt under FOIA Exemption 5, which allows agencies to withhold “inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,” including “predecisional and deliberative” documents that reflect internal Executive Branch deliberations. AAI filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on March 12, 2020, arguing that OMB had not provided a sufficient basis for exempting the documents and that the exemption didn’t apply because the documents were not “predecisional.” On August 13, 2020, after conducting in camera review, the court granted OMB’s motion for summary judgment and denied AAI’s cross-motion, finding that the disputed documents were predecisional and exempt from FOIA. 2020 WL 4698098. 

As of December 25, 2020, AAI has not appealed the court’s decision.

IM-NY-0060,"On Jan. 25, 2018, the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild (NIPNLG) and a law professor brought this Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its component U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as the U.S. Department of State (DOS). The plaintiffs sought to shed light on the government's decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, including its justification and legality. This case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and assigned to Judge Ronnie Abrams on Jan. 29, 2018.

NIPNLG is a nonprofit organization that provides legal assistance to immigrants and advocacy on behalf of noncitizens. The other plaintiff is a professor at the New York University School of Law, where she works on human rights issues and in particular Haiti and Haitian immigrants in the United States.

The plaintiffs sought records related to the government's determination to terminate TPS for Haitian nationals. The plaintiffs argued that ""[t]imely disclosure of these records is critically important because of the looming termination of legal immigration status for tens of thousands of Haitian nationals living in the United States."" The complaint explained that TPS status protected foreign nationals from deportation and allowed them to access work authorization. To get TPS, the individual's country of origin must be designated as warranting TPS and the individual must apply and be approved for the status. The plaintiffs argued that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) required a factual inquiry to terminate TPS for a particular country after the designation had been granted; it could not be terminated without reason. According to the complaint, DHS most recently designated Haiti for TPS in 2015 and then extended the designation by six months in May 2017 in light of extensive hurricane damage. DHS terminated TPS for Haiti on Nov. 20, 2017—according to the plaintiffs, without justification—leaving 58,000 Haitian nationals in the U.S. at the risk of deportation and loss of work authorization.

On Feb. 15, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, noting that DOS had issued a travel warning for Haiti. The plaintiffs also added as a defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which they alleged had not substantively responded to a Nov. 2017 FOIA request.

On March 16, 2018, the defendants wrote to the Court arguing that the plaintiffs did not qualify for expedited processing and that plaintiffs' proposed production schedule was not practicable. The defendants requested additional time to process. On Mar. 23, 2018, the plaintiffs opposed this request.

By April 4, 2018 the parties had agreed on a proposed briefing schedule, which Judge Abrams approved, specifying that each agency was required to produce 1500 pages monthly of the requested documents. The defendants moved for summary judgment on April 27, 2018, and the plaintiffs moved for summary judgement on May 18, 2018.

While the court considered the motions, similar cases involving the termination of Haiti's TPS were litigated, most notably Ramos v. Nielsen, et al., 3:18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal.) and Saget v. Trump, et al., 1:18-cv-01599 (E.D.N.Y.). The documents submitted for discovery in these cases were re-released to the plaintiffs in this case. These releases occurred on March 27, 2019 and April 10, 2019.

Following the release of this additional information, and due to parallel injunctive litigation, the plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their case on April 23, 2019. This case is now closed.","Rofe, Jessica) (Entered: 01/25/2018)\n2 COMPLAINT against Department of Homeland (DHS), Department of State − USA, Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).

Defendant Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) is a component agency of DHS. During the period for which the Secretary has designated a country for TPS, TPS beneficiaries are eligible to remain in the United States and may obtain work authorization. On January 21, 2010, after consulting with the DOS and other government agencies, Secretary Janet Napolitano designated Haiti for TPS for a period of 18 months because she determined that there existed in Haiti “extraordinary and temporary conditions” preventing Haitian nationals from returning to Haiti in safety. This 18-month TPS extension and re-designation were effective through January 22, 2013. On May 24, 2017, Secretary John F. Kelly once again extended TPS for Haiti. says,” WASHINGTON POST, November 3, 2017, available at https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/central-americans-and-haitians-no-longer-need-protected-statusstate-dept-says/2017/11/03/647cbd5c-c0ba-11e7-959cfe2b598d8c00_story.html?utm_term=.4e2a260d7f51. Secretary Duke noted that a new president is in office, and that he intends to rebuild the National Palace. Last, Secretary Duke stated that Haiti’s economy has been recovering since the earthquake.13\n47. Plaintiffs further specified\nthat with regard to item one, they “seek records between April 4, 2017 and November 22, 2017.”\n56. All records relating to any recommendation made by any persons tasked with developing TPS policy or directives from the White House to any employee of USCIS, DHS, ICE, or DOS regarding the termination of TPS for nationals of Haiti since January 20, 2017;\n5. Plaintiffs sought “expedited processing” under 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(6)(e)(i) and a full fee waiver pursuant to both 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(4)(A)(iii) and 6 C.F.R. § 5.11(k)(1) (public interest waivers).\n60. We narrow our request to “records reflecting any inquiry or request made by Kathy Nuebel Kovarik, Chief of USCIS Office of Policy and Strategy, concerning whether, when, and how nationals of Haiti with TPS have used any type of public benefit. Plaintiffs have a statutory right under FOIA, 5 U.S.C. § 552(a)(3)(A), to the records they requested, and there is no legal basis for DHS, DOS, or ICE’s failure to disclose them. In December 2016, in advance of the expiration of the August 2015 extension of TPS for Haitian nationals, Secretary of State John F. Kerry issued a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Jeh Johnson which outlined the extraordinary and temporary conditions that made Haiti unsafe for the return of nearly 60,000 Haitian nationals and recommended that Secretary Johnson extend TPS for Haiti upon its expiration on July 22, 2017.6\n33. 20 Id. 21 REFUGEES INTERNATIONAL, TWO STEPS BACK: HAITI STILL REELING FROM HURRICANE MATTHEW 5 (2017), https://www.refugeesinternational.org/reports/2017/4/6/haiti.\n13\n\n\x0cCase 1:18-cv-00659-RA Document 30 Filed 02/15/18 Page 14 of 26\npositions remain unfilled, and the police have a presence in fewer than half of Haiti’s 570 communal sections;22 and (vi) a widening fiscal deficit, with economic growth slowing to one percent and public expenditures on the rise to meet post-Matthew reconstruction needs.23 52. 23 THE WORLD BANK, Haiti: Overview, http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/haiti/overview (October 2017).\n14\n\n\x0cCase 1:18-cv-00659-RA Document 30 Filed 02/15/18 Page 15 of 26\n55.

JI-SC-0001,"On December 28, 1990, juveniles confined by the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice (formerly the Department of Youth Services) filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Carolina against the South Carolina Department of Juvenile Justice. The class consisted of all juveniles who were or would be confined in the correctional facilities of the defendant. The South Carolina Protection and Advocacy System for the Handicapped and private counsel represented the class. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief along with damages, alleging that the conditions at the correctional facilities deprived juveniles of various statutory rights and violated the constitutional guarantees due process, equal protection, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.

The juvenile institutions in question were overcrowded, lacked adequate staffing, and lacked adequate fire safety. The correctional facilities were in disrepair, the disciplinary policies were implemented without regard to their psychological effect on the juveniles, and the juveniles were classified only by size and sex. Medical and mental health services were insufficient for the population of the facilities. Telephone communication, visitation, and access to courts and attorneys were all restricted. The Department of Juvenile Justice failed to provide a vocational education and any special education. 

On January 25, 1995, the District Court (Judge Joseph F. Anderson, Jr.) required the Department of Juvenile Justice to submit a remedial plan to the court within 120 days. The court held (1) that the conditions at the juvenile institutions violated the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment, (2) that the juveniles had a constitutional right to personal safety, (3) that the juveniles had a constitutional right to medical services, (4) that the juveniles had a constitutional right to minimally adequate program services to teach principles essential to correcting conduct, (5) that the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 applied to juvenile correctional facilities, and (6) that states were given the opportunity in the first instance to correct the deficiencies. Alexander S. v. Boyd, 876 F. Supp. 773 (D.S.C. 1995).

On November 22, 1995, the District Court (Judge Anderson) granted the plaintiffs' motion for an award of attorneys' fees and costs. Alexander S. By and Through Bowers v. Boyd, 929 F. Supp. 925 (D.S.C. 1995). The U.S. Court of Appeals Fourth Circuit (per curiam) affirmed the District Court's decision on May 6, 1996. Alexander S. v. Boyd, 89 F.3d 827 (4th Cir. 1996).

On September 27, 1996, the District Court granted the plaintiffs' motion to clarify that the juveniles transferred from the correctional facilities, which were the subject matter of the original litigation, remained members of the plaintiff class. The court further held that its November 22, 1995 order applied to all similarly situated facilities operated by the Department of Juvenile Justice, not just those facilities that were the explicit subject matter of the litigation. On June 27, 1997, the Fourth Circuit (per curiam) affirmed the District Court's decision. Davis v. Boyd, 116 F.3d 1473 (4th Cir. 1997).

On May 28, 1997, the Fourth Circuit held that the attorneys' fee limitations set forth in &sect; 803(d) of the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997e, apply to juvenile facilities as well as adult facilities. The court remanded the case to the District Court to apply the attorneys' fees limitations when calculating the amount of plaintiffs' attorneys' fees. Alexander S. v. Boyd, 113 F.3d 1373 (4th Cir. 1997).

On January 26, 1998, the Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of certiorari. Alexander S. v. Boyd, 522 U.S. 1090 (1998).

On August 16, 2004 and October 6, 2004, the District Court (Judge Anderson) denied a motion to reopen the case or for relief from the judgment on the grounds that the movant was not a party to the action and the time to reopen the judgment had long passed. On March 7, 2005, the Fourth Circuit (per curiam) affirmed the District Court's decision. Alexander S. v. Byars, 2005 WL 548250 (4th Cir. 2005).

","The Plaintiff Class seeks this relief on their own behalf and as representatives of a class of similarly situated juveniles who are presently, and/or in the future will be, housed within the various facilities operated by the South Carolina Department of Youth Services. A proper computation of the lodestar fee will, in the great majority of cases, constitute the ""reasonable fee"" contemplated by Section 1988.\nFinally, in addressing the reasonableness of the fee award in the case at bar, the court must be mindful of the Supreme Court\'s admonition in Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 437, 103 S.Ct. 939 Hensley v. Eckerhart, 461 U.S. 424, 434, 103 S.Ct. The third attorney\'s time sheets do, however, include a significant block of time for trial preparation, which is not inconsistent with the time sheets of the other attorneys.\nAlthough the court disagrees with defendants on the adequacy of the records generally and with the alleged internal inconsistencies identified by defendants, the court agrees with defendants that some hours need to be deleted in calculating the lodestar fee in this case.[7]\nFirst, the court will disallow a portion of the charges asserted for ""project assistants.""

On that same date, the court approved the litigation team assembled to represent the Plaintiffs in this action. Also, the court visited the Columbia, South Carolina facility of the Alston Wilkes Society.\nIn 1992, the court appointed five expert witnesses pursuant to Fed. Following is a brief description of the physical plant and functions of the three campuses.\nWillow Lane houses all of the female juveniles, as well as the less aggressive and younger males. As a part of the remedial plan submitted in this case, the Defendants should furnish a progress report on these and any other improvements that will assure the removal of cockroaches and other foreign matter from food served to juveniles at DJJ.\nD. Classification\nClassification, for the purposes of this case, is the process of separating aggressive juveniles from passive ones and determining appropriate levels of restraint for each juvenile based upon the threat the juvenile presents to other juveniles and to the public. It would be an understatement to say that DJJ\'s building program has not proceeded apace with the significant growth in population and juvenile delinquency in South Carolina; there has, in fact, been no building program for the past twenty-five years. When the remedial plan required by this order is submitted to the court, the court will review the overcrowding question, as it should be reviewed, within the broader context of the overall remedial plan submitted.\nIn addition, the court finds that staffing levels at DJJ facilities, like the physical plant, are geared towards the needs of the 1970s era. P. 65.\nA. The Constitutional Standard\nCourts around the country are not in agreement as to the appropriate federal standard by which to judge state juvenile detention facility conditions. 2352, 80 L.Ed.2d 825 (1984); Milonas v. Williams, 691 F.2d 931, 942 & n. 10 (10th Cir.1982), cert. The IEP planning meeting cannot occur until the juvenile has been at the facility at least seven days, because the parents of the juvenile must be given seven days advance notice of the meeting.[47] Thus, for juveniles at the Reception and Evaluation Center, even under the best of circumstances, the new IEP would be of short duration. A new\n\n\x0cIEP must, however, be formulated in accordance with the statutory law if and when the juvenile is later sent to one of the three long-term institutions.\nThe Department of Justice memorandum also indicates that school districts around South Carolina have erroneously concluded that FERPA prevents them from sending school records to DJJ without the consent of the parents of the juveniles affected. 28 C.F.R. § 35.104 (1993); 45 C.F.R. § 84.3(j) (1993). Taylor v. Freeman, 34 F.3d 266, 268 (4th Cir.1994). Judge Burnside is a former state legislator and an eighteen-year veteran of the family court bench. Indeed, such a pronouncement would apparently run afoul of the Supreme Court\'s mandate in Jackson v. Indiana, supra, that nature of confinement be reasonably related to the purpose of the confinement.\nAccordingly, because South Carolina\'s policy behind incarcerating juvenile delinquents is to provide them with rehabilitation, the court has determined that the juveniles at DJJ are entitled under the Constitution to rehabilitative treatment.\n[44] Youngberg, like Jackson, involved a challenge by a mental retardate to the conditions of his confinement. During this hearing, the State agreed to revise its proposed plan. For the purposes of this appeal, we are concerned primarily with §§ 802 and 803 of the PLRA (codified at 18 U.S.C.A. § 3626 (West Supp.1997) and 42 U.S.C.A. § 1997e (West Supp.1997)).[6]\n1380 *1380 Prior to the PLRA, § 3626 of Title 18 was titled ""Appropriate remedies with respect to prison crowding."" 803(d) (codified at 42 U.S.C.A. § 1997e(d)(1)). However, § 802 of the PLRA, which sets forth the procedures through which a class of prisoners such as Plaintiffs may contest constitutional violations pertaining to prison conditions, defines ""prison"" as ""any Federal, State, or local facility that incarcerates or detains juveniles or adults accused of, convicted of, sentenced for, or adjudicated delinquent for, violations of criminal law."" § In addition, § 809(a) of the PLRA (codified at 28 U.S.C.A. § 1932 (West Supp.1997)) specifically limits the revocation of earned release credit to ""adult[s] convicted of a crime and confined in a Federal correctional facility"" if the district court concludes that they filed a civil claim for a malicious purpose, solely to harass the party against which it was filed, or if the claimant presents false evidence to the court. Bowers v. Boyd, 89 F.3d 827 (4th Cir.1996) (unpublished).\nWe do not consider the State\'s waiver of application of the PLRA\'s attorney\'s fees provision to the November 1995 order to be a waiver of the statute\'s applicability to all future awards based on work completed prior to April 26, 1996. As a result, we conclude that the State preserved the issue of the amendments\' application to all awards made by the district court subsequent to the enactment of the PLRA.\n2.\nSection 803(d) of the PLRA provides that ""[n]o award of attorney\'s fees"" ordered in an action brought by a prisoner claiming unconstitutional conditions of confinement ""shall be based on an hourly rate greater than 150 1386 percent of the hourly rate established under section 3006A of Title 18, for *1386 payment of court-appointed counsel."" § Accordingly, the plain language of § 803(d) of the PLRA (codified at 42 U.S.C.A. § 1997e(d)) mandates that the attorney\'s fees limitations apply to the awards made in the May, August, and October orders, regardless of when the work being compensated was performed.\nWe acknowledge that other courts that have addressed the applicability of the attorney\'s fees provisions of § 803 of the PLRA to pending cases have refused to apply the limitations, concluding that such application would have an impermissible retroactive effect. at 1494 (rejecting argument that ""because Congress provided specifically for prospectivity in two places ... we should infer that it intended the opposite for the remainder of the statute"").\nAbsent an express directive from Congress, we must apply a newly enacted statute to pending cases unless doing so would give the statute ""retroactive effect."" Section 803(d) of the PLRA requires the district court to conduct a three-step analysis when reviewing attorney\'s fees requests. We disagree and hold that the district court properly determined that Plaintiffs were the ""prevailing party"" in the February order and, therefore, were eligible for fees under 42 U.S.C.A. § 1988.\nPart of the remedial plan initially proposed by the State included an increase in the number of security staff to provide minimal levels of physical safety for the juveniles housed in the State\'s juvenile facilities. As noted, the district court set forth a specific procedure for attorney\'s fee applications such that the State had ample opportunity to object to any submissions by the Plaintiffs.",0.7081,0.2536,0.3735,0.2402,0.086,0.1266,0.289,0.1035,0.1524
EE-MO-0105,"On January 23, 2004, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and 2000e(k), against AT&T Corporation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, was a former AT&T employee and asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, alleging that AT&T's health insurance policy discriminated against women.  Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendant's health insurance plan, which did not provide prescription contraceptives (birth control) before 2002 and only through the mail after 2002, violated female employees' civil rights.

The action originally started in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, but was transferred to Missouri on May 12, 2003.  This is the date on which the docket begins.  Originally, there were two plaintiffs on the case, but one dropped out of the litigation.  Thus, a single plaintiff carried forth the case.

On September 3, 2004, the Court (Judge Sachs) denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification.  In the opinion, the Court barely discussed the requirements for a class-action lawsuit, except to point out typicality.  The plaintiff, since the suit began, had stopped taking birth control and was seeking to get pregnant.  Therefore, the Court declared that a class could not be certified without a class representative who would have an ongoing interest in the prayed-for relief.  The plaintiff wanted to recover her past expenditures on the prescribed contraceptives.  The Women's Law project came onto the case as an amicus.  After a lengthy discovery period, the Court made another ruling.

On June 7, 2006, the Court (Judge Sachs) granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification as to the damages in the complaint.  The class was comprised of female employees of AT&T, who paid for their own prescription contraception from the dates of October 31, 2001 to July 2, 2002.  The Court did not certify the claims for injunctive or declaratory relief because as of 2002, the health insurance provider covered birth control through mail order. While the cost of the plaintiff's potential recovery was relatively small, $68.07, the class action potential in the litigation, given AT&T's size made both parties fight vigorously.  According to the docket, neither side was content with this decision.  The plaintiff wanted the period of time for damages claims to be extended, and the defendant did not approve of the decision at all.  Ultimately, the plaintiffs filed an appeal.  

On June 1, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a preliminary judgment to the District Court (Judge Sachs).  The Circuit Court advised the District Court to review the findings of another recent case, In Re Union Pacific Railroad Employment Practices Litigation, 479 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2007).  This case featured a ruling that was fundamentally at odds with the decision of the District Court on June 7, 2006.

On October 22, 2007, the District Court (Judge Sachs) vacated its previous decision, and ordered a decision in favor of the defendant.  The case was closed the next day on October 23, 2007.

Ms. Stocking elected to take advantage of the PPO option.\n18. As a direct and proximate result of the AT&T Plan\'s failure to cover contraception [**8] to prevent pregnancy, Ms. Stocking and other proposed members of the class were required to pay for their monthly or periodic contraceptives on an out-of-pocket basis, or risk unintended pregnancy. If contraception were treated on an equal basis with other prescriptions under the Plan and the Drug Plan, Ms. Stocking and other proposed class members would have paid a low co-pay, or no co-pay at all, for generic or brand-name, 34 day supply, of contraception.\n[*6] IV. Ninety-four percent of American women use contraception at some point during their reproductive years. Pre-term labor is one of the most common reasons women are hospitalized before delivery. Unintended pregnancy poses far greater health risks to women and children than does intended pregnancy. Unintended pregnancy is both frequent and widespread in the United States. Moreover, the Guidelines for Women\'s Health Care published by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), which represents 38,000 physicians in this country, advises that ""prevention of unwanted pregnancy"" and ""contraceptive options"" be discussed with all women over the age of 13 during routine [**15] primary care assessments.

While the parties and I do not find substantial appellate court discussion of the issue, the plain language of Justice Thomas in Morgan effectively ""eviscerates the continuing violation doctrine outside of hostile environment claims"", as contended by the successful defendant in Lewis v.

EE-IL-0282,"Between November 18, 2005 and November 16, 2006, current and former African-American financial advisor employees and trainees filed a lawsuit against their employer, Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., in the U.S. District Court of the Northern District of Illinois under both Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for both monetary damages and injunctive relief, alleging the defendant engaged in race discrimination in terms of hiring, retention, promotion, pay, resource allocation and more. 

The plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on July 19, 2006.

On November 8, 2008 the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On August 9, 2010, the District Court (Judge Robert W. Gettleman) issued an amended order denying the plaintiffs' motion for class certification on the ground that commonality was not satisfied because the putative class members were supervised by hundreds of different people and had a wide variety of salary levels and positions. 2010 WL 3087483. 

On February 14, 2011, Judge Gettleman denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration for class certification and their request to narrow the class definition. Judge Gettleman held that the plaintiffs' disparate impact claim was not sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement for class certification and that their class as proposed failed to satisfy either category of class certification because the individual questions of law and claims to relief predominated over those of the class. 2011 WL 658155.

The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. (Judges Richard Posner, Diane Wood, and David Hamilton), which denied the request based on an untimely appeal. 

The plaintiffs filed an amended motion for class certification in July 2011, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court decided Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes.  Judge Gettlman denied their motion on September 19, 2011, once again on commonality grounds. 2011 WL 4471028.

The employees filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On February 24, 2012, the Seventh Circuit (Judges Posner, Wood, and Hamilton) reversed the District Court decision. The Circuit Court held that the issue of whether Merrill Lynch's policies had a disparate impact on African-American employees was appropriate for class-wide treatment because each of the plaintiffs' claims had the common question of whether Merrill Lynch ""violated the antidiscrimination statutes."" 672 F.3d 482. 

Merrill Lynch's motion for rehearing en banc was denied by the Seventh Circuit on March 27, 2012.  Its subsequent appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied on October 1, 2012.

On July 13, 2012, the District Court issued certification of the disparate impact class, according to the Seventh Circuit's order.  

On December 6, 2013, the District Court (Judge Gettleman) approved a settlement agreement on all claims proposed by the parties. Pursuant to the agreement, Merrill Lynch would allocate $160 million in a settlement fund, $25 million of which would be designated for extraordinary claims. The District Court also approved service awards of $250,000 for each Class Representative and $75,000 for each member of the Steering Committee. In regards to attorney's fees, the District Court approved the plaintiff's requested attorney's fees of 21.25% (20% of the first 100 million of the settlement fund and 15% of the remainder). The programmatic relief granted by the settlement consisted of several changes to company policies, including changes to the distribution of accounts, as well as the establishment of coaching for African American financial advisors and a diversity fund to assist African Americans in funding business development events. This portion of the settlement lasted for 3 years. 

On December 16, 2014, a named plaintiff filed a motion to appeal the District Court's final approval of the class action settlement, but the Seventh Circuit (Diane P. Wood, Richard D. Cudahy, and Diane S. Sykes) denied the appeal based on an untimely request.

The settlement how now run its course and there has been no further litigation. The case is now closed.","Count I), and 42 U.S.C. §\n\n1981 (Count II). Each FA is responsible for building a book of business by soliciting clients in the community, although some accounts are distributed by management. P. 23, which governs class actions, requires a two step analysis to determine whether class certification is appropriate. Martinez v. Haleas, 2009 WL 2916852 at *2 (N.D. Ill. 2009); Harriston v. Chicago Tribune Co., 992 F.2d 697, 703 (7th Cir. Numerosity Under Rule 23(a)(1), plaintiffs must show that the class is so numerous that joinder of all\nmembers is impracticable. Ellis v. Elgin River Boat Resort, 217 F.R.D. 415, 420 (N.D. Ill. 2003).\nObviously, establishing commonality under a disparate treatment theory is more difficult than doing so under the disparate impact theory. If this were a disparate impact case, that statistic would present a compelling argument for finding commonality and certifying a class. See Payton v. County of Carroll, 473 F.3d 845, 854 (7th Cir. Consequently, the court concludes that even if plaintiffs could establish all the requirements of Rule 23(a), which they cannot, they cannot establish the requirements of Rule 23(b).\nAs Judge Kennelly noted in Adams, although it maybe possible in an appropriate case to certify a company-wide class involving multiple branch offices across the country, this is not the appropriate case.

In these business pursuits, Merrill Lynch falsely represents that it is an equal opportunity employer. Merrill Lynch relies on these quintile rankings to distribute a variety of benefits or resources, as explained below. Merrill Lynch has acknowledged at the symposia and/or to its Advisory Council to Management that no fewer than 70% of African-American brokers with a length of service in excess of ten years are in the bottom two quintiles. These putative class members were denied employment or were employed at Merrill Lynch offices across the country. Stowell & Friedman, Ltd., and the putative class placed Merrill Lynch on notice of the class-wide allegations of racial discrimination by McReynolds through the Firm’s Employment Dispute Resolution (“EDR”) process. The experiences of McReynolds are also typical of the Firm’s pattern or practice of discrimination with regard to partnerships, which work to the advantage of white brokers and to the disadvantage of African-American brokers. Count One of\nplaintiffs’ second amended complaint, which is brought under Title VII, is actually very broad,\nencompassing both a pattern or practice discriminatory treatment claim and a discriminatory\nimpact claim. Contrary to plaintiff’s assertion in their brief in support of their motion to reconsider (p. 8), this court did not hold that:\nDefendant’s expert performed a study of published available census data and concluded that access to networks or potential clients with substantial wealth varies by race among defendant’s FAs.

IM-MA-0009,"This federal lawsuit, filed by the cities of Chelsea and Lawrence, Massachusetts, on Feb. 8, 2017, challenged President Trump’s Jan. 25, 2017 <a href=""https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-30/pdf/2017-02102.pdf"">Executive Order 13768</a>, dealing with immigration enforcement, which threatened to withhold federal funds from ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" and take enforcement action against any locality that impedes the federal government's immigration law. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Boston Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The plaintiffs alleged that the Executive Order violated the Tenth Amendment by coercing cities to choose between losing federal funding and losing control of their municipal self-governance. The Executive Order does not include a clear definition of what it means to be a ""sanctuary"" jurisdiction, apart from referencing 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that a local government entity cannot prohibit or restrict communication between government entities or officials and federal immigration authorities. The plaintiffs alleged their own compliance with § 1373, but complained first that § 1373 is unconstitutional, and second, that Executive Order threatened their funding without advance notice by unclearly extending beyond § 1373. The plaintiffs alleged that the U.S. had begun to designate certain cities as ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" and that Chelsea and Lawrence stood to be designated as such. In order to improve cooperation between immigrant residents and municipal police, Chelsea designated itself a ""sanctuary city"" and Lawrence took similar actions. The plaintiffs explained that they therefore feared being labeled ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" under the Executive Order and thus losing federal grants. As small cities with large working-class immigrant populations, the plaintiffs feared the implications of such a loss of key funding for their municipal budgets, including for public services that have nothing to do with immigration.

The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked for a declaration that Chelsea and Lawrence comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, that § 1373 is an unconstitutional infringement on municipal and state self-government authority, and that the Executive Order violates the Tenth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. In addition, they claimed that the Executive Order violates the separation of powers by penalizing § 1373 violations without Congressional approval.

The case was assigned to Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. 

On Apr. 10, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The defendants argued that they have taken no action against the cities pursuant to the executive order and that the cities cannot show they have been injured by the existence of the EO. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on April 25, 2017, granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against operation of the Executive Order.  See <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15608"">San Francisco v. Trump</a> for details. 

On May 2, the plaintiffs moved to stay the proceedings in light of the nationwide preliminary injunction, and the court entered a stay on May 4. The case is marked ""administratively closed,"" which just means that it is on hold. The parties can inform the Court if they wish to resume litigation.

If Plaintiff Cities are found to be “sanctuary jurisdictions,” the Executive Order instructs the Attorney General and the Secretary of DHS to “ensure” that Plaintiff Cities are “not eligible to receive Federal grants.” Secretary Kelly is responsible for executing relevant provisions of the Executive Order. The City of Chelsea, Massachusetts is located directly across the Mystic River from Boston. It was first settled in 1624, established itself as a town in 1739 and was incorporated as a city in 1857. Chelsea has an annual budget of $170 million, of which approximately $13.9 million derives from federal funding. Lawrence has long been a multi-ethnic and multicultural gateway city. As of 2010, 73.8% of the city’s residents identified as Hispanic or Latino. Lawrence employs approximately 2,967 people. In a statement by White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer on January 25, 2017, announcing the issuance of the Executive Order, Spicer stated: “We are going to strip federal\n9\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-10214-GAO Document 1 Filed 02/08/17 Page 10 of 45\ngrant money from the sanctuary states and cities that harbor illegal immigrants. 9(a).\n11\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-10214-GAO Document 1 Filed 02/08/17 Page 12 of 45\n43. Furthermore, the Chelsea Police Department shall not participate in ICE tactical operations to enforce purely civil immigration violations. In order to achieve its local law enforcement goals, the Lawrence Trust Ordinance generally declares the enforcement of federal immigration law as beyond the purview of the\n16\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-10214-GAO Document 1 Filed 02/08/17 Page 17 of 45\nCity, and prohibits the City’s law enforcement personnel from contacting, detaining, or arresting a person based on immigration status. It is impossible to create a budget when it is unclear what effect the Executive Order will have on its funding.\n22\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-10214-GAO Document 1 Filed 02/08/17 Page 23 of 45\nVII. Consistent with the plain language of the statute, the federal government has never used § 1373 as a vehicle to impose conditions on the receipt of any federal funding, including grant programs with no connection to law enforcement.\n98. The Executive Order therefore threatens over 15% of Lawrence’s annual budget.\n104. The application of § 1373 against Plaintiff Cities would place Plaintiff Cities “in the position of taking the blame for [the] burdensomeness and … defects” of a federal program,\n27\n\n\x0cCase 1:17-cv-10214-GAO Document 1 Filed 02/08/17 Page 28 of 45\nthus blurring the lines of accountability that the Tenth Amendment is intended to preserve. The federal government also cannot force Plaintiff Cities to share access to, or use of, City law enforcement “facilities, records/databases, booking lists,” or access to individuals in the Cities’ custody, without “a criminal warrant signed by a judge and based on probable cause.” shall incur any fiscal obligation on the part of the Department. Open communication and good relationships with local communities are critical in preventing and investigating crime. Assistance from the many various immigrant populations is especially important when an immigrant, whether documented or not, is the victim or witness to a crime. Lawrence Trust Ordinance, § 9.20.010.\n132. Encouraging residents to come forward with information regarding criminal activity is especially important in cities such as Chelsea and Lawrence, where more than a third of the Cities’ populations were born outside of the United States. Defendants contend that “sanctuary jurisdictions” do not comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373. The conditions that the Executive Order Section 9(a) places on federal grants are constitutionally improper because they were not established unambiguously prior to the funds being granted, and did not allow Plaintiff Cities to make knowing, cognizant decisions about whether to accept federal grants. Plaintiffs repeat and incorporate by reference each allegation of the prior paragraphs as if fully set forth herein.

The Cities’ Complaint is based on speculation concerning the Order’s scope, assumptions about the manner in which the Secretary and Attorney General might interpret and implement the Order’s provisions, and conjecture concerning the possibility that the Cities might one day be designated as “sanctuary jurisdictions” pursuant to the Order and might lose certain, unidentified federal grants as a result.

The imbrication is nowhere more apparent than in preenforcement challenges.”). Beyond the lack of justiciability of all of the Cities’ claims, the Cities fail to state a claim\nthat 8 U.S.C. § 1373 on its face violates the Tenth Amendment. City of N.Y. v.

IM-AL-0010,"On November 17, 2011, several couples who reside in Alabama filed a class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of the Middle District of Alabama against the State of Alabama, alleging violations of the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.  The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and private counsel, sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees, alleging that the defendants' policies discriminated against non-U.S. citizens trying to obtain a marriage license in Alabama.  

In Alabama, no person may marry without a marriage license.  One of a probate judge's ministerial jobs is to issue marriage licenses to those couples that meet the requirements.  Alabama law states that the parties issuing the marriage license must obtain the Social Security Number of the individuals getting married and have it appear in the marriage license and certificate.  In 2008, the Alabama Attorney General, issued a statement saying that a Social Security Number or other proofs of citizenship were not required to obtain a marriage license.  The Attorney General ordered the probate offices to instead allow people trying to get married the opportunity to submit an affidavit saying they do not have a Social Security Number.  

On September 13, 2012, the District Court (Judge William Keith Watkins) denied Defendant Probate Judge McKinney, Jr.'s (Probate Judge Reed's predecessor) motion to dismiss.  The defendant argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing since they did not apply for a marriage license and thus did not suffer any type of injury.  However, the District Court (Judge Watkins) did not buy this argument since Judge McKinney, Jr. had a clear policy of requiring non-citizens who wanted to get a marriage license to provide proof of legal status.  The District Court (Judge Watkins) thus found that the plaintiffs were effectively barred from applying for a marriage license and that applying for it would have been futile.  On September 25, 2012, the District Court (Judge Watkins) denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification so on December 7, 2012, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint.  

On June 3, 2013, the District Court (Judge William Keith Watkins) entered a protective order assuring the confidentiality of certain information disclosed by both parties.  On June 11, 2013, the District Court (Judge Watkins) granted Defendant Probate Judge Reed's motion to dismiss any claims against him.  Judge Reed argued that his probate office did not require proof of citizenship prior to issuing marriage licenses, and that he was actually willing to give the plaintiffs their marriage licenses if they had applied for it.  Judge McKinney, Jr.'s prior policy was repealed and so the District Court (Judge Watkins) found that the plaintiffs no longer had standing.  

On August 19, 2013, the District Court (Judge William Keith Watkins) approved the parties' joint stipulation of dismissal.  As part of the agreement, the official Probate County's marriage policy was amended and published so that it was clear that there were no citizenship requirements, including a Social Security Number, to obtaining a marriage license.

It is important to their religious faiths that the couple marry.\n4. Both couples desire to express their love for and commitment to one another by getting married and obtaining the economic, emotional, and psychological benefits of marriage, including the satisfaction that would come from obeying their religions\' tenets concerning marriage.\n5. The right to marry is a fundamental right guaranteed under the United States Constitution to all persons regardless of immigration status. Ms. Loder is 27 years old, not currently married, and wholly unrelated to her fiancé, Jack Doe, by blood. Ms. Loder has an original Social Security card, an Alabama birth certificate, and an Alabama Non-Driver Identification card. Plaintiff Loder sues on her own behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated. Plaintiff Jack Doe sues on his own behalf and on behalf of those similarly situated.\n12. Plaintiff James Doe is a Mexican national who currently lives in Alabama. He is ineligible to receive a marriage license in Montgomery County because he does not have a proof of his legal presence in the United States and does not have a Social Security card due to his immigration status.\n15. Venue is proper in the Middle District of Alabama pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 139 1(b) in that Defendant McKinney, Jr. resides within the Middle District of Alabama, and ""a substantial part of the events or omissions giving rise to the claim[s] occurred"" within this District and Division, including the enforcement of the unlawful policy and practice that are the subject of this lawsuit.\nCLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS Plaintiff Class Allegations\n23. They are represented by experienced counsel with expertise in class action litigation and litigation involving the constitutional rights of immigrants. On information and belief, Defendant McKinney, Jr. has no interests antagonistic to or in conflict with the interests of other members of the proposed class, and as Probate Judge of Montgomery County, he is qualified and competent to represent the proposed defendant class.\n\n\x0cCase 2:11-cv-00979-WKW-WC Document 1 Filed 11/17/11 Page 10 of 18\nFACTS Issuance of Marriage Licenses in Alabama 34. In Alabama, no person may marry without a license. Alabama Code § 22-9A-17 requires the probate judge to prepare and forward a completed marriage license form to the Bureau of Vital Statistics. There is no requirement that identification be submitted or that the information on the form be verified. Neither the Code of Alabama nor the Alabama Constitution requires marriage license applicants to provide proof of legal presence in the United States to secure a marriage license. Plaintiffs, and the class they seek to represent, are entitled to declaratory relief, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 2201 and 2202, and injunctive relief against Defendant McKinney, Jr., and the defendant class members.\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION Fourteenth Amendment Equal Protection Clause;\n42 U.S.C. 1983 (Plaintiffs, and those similarly situated, against Defendant, and those similarly situated)\n14\n\n\x0cCase 2:11-cv-00979-WKW-WC Document 1 Filed 11/17/11 Page 15 of 18\n61. At the time of filing Plaintiffs’ original complaint in November, 2011, Defendant McKinney, Jr., acting as the Probate Judge of Montgomery County, had adopted, implemented, and enforced a policy and practice that categorically denied a marriage license to any couple where one or both of its members lack proof of lawful immigration status, including lacking a social security number. Plaintiff Jack Doe meets all the lawful requirements under Alabama law to be issued a marriage license. Julie Doe has lived in Alabama with her fiancé, Jonathan Doe, since 1997. He is 33 years old, not currently married, and wholly unrelated to his fiancée, Julie Doe, by blood. Jonathan Doe does not have a Social Security number, nor identification issued by the State of Alabama, and cannot show proof of his lawful immigration status. She maintains an office in Tallapoosa County, Alabama.\n20. 2008-100, 2008 WL 2662000, at *4, 2008 Ala. AG LEXIS 70 (June 25, 2008). Plaintiffs Julie Doe and Jonathan Doe have lived together for over fifteen years in a committed relationship. FACTUAL BACKGROUND Plaintiffs Charelle Loder and her fiancéJack Doe want to get married.

STANDARD OF REVIEW Defendant challenges the court’s subject matter jurisdiction under Rule 12(b)(1) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, arguing that Plaintiffs do not have standing to challenge his policy regarding marriage licenses. McElmurray, 501 F.3d at 1251 (quoting Lawrence, 919 F.2d at 1529). Defendant urges the court to adopt a reading of the policy that would not require non-citizen applicants to show proof of legal presence in the United States. This case concerns constitutional standing. trace[able] to the challenged action of the defendant, and not . . . While Defendant’s policy is not a state statute, the court deems it appropriate to construe the policy according to this recognized principle of statutory construction, absent any contrary argument or authority having been offered by the parties.\nThe second paragraph of the policy is not redundant of the first paragraph because the second paragraph applies to all applicants, while the first paragraph applies to non-citizen applicants. There is no reason to read the second paragraph of the policy as altering the express requirement for non-citizens of the United States to provide proof of legal presence in the United States in the form of valid immigration documents or passport. Plaintiffs have sufficiently pled that the policy bars certain non-citizens from successfully securing a marriage license.\n10\n\n\x0cB.

PC-UT-0003,"On December 18, 1989, Sandra Henry filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C &sect; 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against the Utah Department of Corrections.  Henry brought the lawsuit on behalf of herself and current and future inmates at the Utah State Penitentiary at Draper.  Plaintiffs were represented by the Legal Center for the Handicapped, the ACLU of Utah Foundation, and private attorneys.  The National Prison Project of the ACLU later represented plaintiffs.  The lawsuit was seeking injunctive relief ordering defendant to take steps to improve medical and mental health care provided at the prison.  The plaintiffs alleged that the prison failed to employ enough physicians, dentists, psychiatrists, and nurses to provide care to inmates, leaving inmates with unmet medical needs.  For example, Henry was an HIV positive inmate who was denied AZT despite federal guidelines mandating the treatment.  Inmates were required to use a lengthy grievance procedure, which could last up to 70 days, when their medical needs were unmet, even when their conditions were serious or potentially life threatening.  Inmates with severe mental health disorders were often housed in the general population.

The parties agreed on a settlement of the mental health claims on September 8, 1992.  In April of 1993, the court (Chief Judge Bruce S. Jenkins) approved the settlement and retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement.  Prison officials agreed to employ an adequate number of mental health professionals, to screen all inmates entering the prison system for signs of mental illness, and provide individualized treatment plans to inmates.  All inmates would receive information regarding mental health services available at the prison.  The settlement agreement also covered training of staff, crisis intervention procedures, and procedures for administering psychotropic medications.  Defendants were given two years to comply with these provisions.  

On January 23, 1993, the parties executed a settlement of the medical and dental claims.  A final order approving this settlement was entered on June 1, 1993 by Judge Jenkins.  Defendants agreed to ensure that inmates had access to a health care program equivalent to that within the community.  A Bureau of Medical Services, under the direction of physicians, was given authority to implement the changes within the prison system.  Defendants agreed to create a Continuous Quality Improvement Committee to assure compliance with the policies and procedures outlined in the settlement agreement and to oversee all contracts awarded to outside health care providers. Specific provisions of the settlement agreement included screening all incoming inmates for chronic conditions, communicable diseases, and dental problems, providing inmates with periodic health reviews, providing an adequate number of infirmary beds, and providing inmates with daily access to a licensed health care professional. Defendants were given two years to comply with these provisions.  

The docket indicates that the case was closed on June 24, 1993 and litigation continued through 2000 regarding attorneys' fees.

PRELIMINARY STATEMENT\n1. Plaintiff is a representative party of the class which is composed of all persons presently confined at the Prison or who may be so confined in the future. Defendant Barnes is responsible for the overall safety of the Inmates at the Prison. Defendant Barnes is directly responsible for the continuing incarceration of the Inmates under conditions that are unconstitutional. Another Inmate witnessed TE suffering an apparent heart attack. This handling of the emergency represents a gross deviation from standards of care typically practiced by emergency medical technicians.\n-15-\n\n\x0cFailure to Treat Chronic Medical Conditions 30. Inmate UL complained that he was losing vision in his right eye over a period of several months. Not only did BI receive inadequate prescription drug treatment for his epileptic condition, but he was disciplined by Prison authorities for a medical condition beyond his control.\nb. As a direct result of UL\'s inability to obtain needed medication, he has been referred back to the UUMC Opthamology Clinic to determine if further surgery is necessary.\nInadequate Medical Grievance Procedures 38. Between twenty-five percent and thirty percent of the entire Prison population is estimated to have some form of mental illness; however, only one psychiatrist works part-time to supervise the mental health treatment of all Inmates. Inmates receive most mental health counseling (when available at all) from social workers rather than psychologists or psychiatrists. Inmate LO suffers from major depression and pedophilia. He requested to see a psychiatrist in order to have, his medications reviewed because the medications are causing side-effects, but has not seen a psychiatrist. He currently resides at the Special Services Dormitory. His only treatment was ""group therapy"" twice each month which often consisted only of playing basketball and pasting pictures.\nb. Inmate GA resides in the general population. 3, work together to maximize the appropriate treatment for the seriously mentally ill inmate.\nIt is imperative that security, medical and mental"" health staff be available to inmates on a twenty-four (24) hour basis and have opportunity for input to the treatment team at all stages of the treatment process. As a basic part of the inmate\'s initial reception and orientation to the USP, each inmate shall receive written material, prepared in simple language, which explains what mental health services are available at any unit or site within the USP. Staff will receive special pre-service, followed by regular in-service, training in the following: a. Recognition of signs and symptoms of mental illness in the inmate population;\n-8-\n\n\x0cb. Night coverage will be provided via telephone on an on-call basis and on-site consultation when necessary by all mental health professional staff. 3, in such units.\nWhile treatment needs may require the temporary movement of such inmates into mental health treatment settings, the classification of all inmates remains the responsibility of the classification officer, who is not a mental health professional, as is presently done. The USP shall create and maintain an efficient record-keeping system for the seriously mentally ill, using the technology it deems appropriate, so that any mental health professional is able to maintain continuity of care by having timely access to any such records as are required.\nAn interdisciplinary team of USP mental health professionals shall undertake a systematic and periodic quality assurance review of the records of seriously mentally ill inmates receiving mental health services.

DR-CA-0001,"On March 26, 1993, the United States Justice Department filed this lawsuit under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000a et seq. (the Public Accommodations Act), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against TW Services and its subsidiary, Denny's, Inc., which operates Denny's Restaurants, alleging discriminatory treatment of African Americans by Denny's restaurants in California. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Denny's implemented terms and conditions for service of black customers, such as the requirement of prepayment and cover charges, that were not required of white patrons, that African Americans received poorer service, and that they were discouraged from patronizing the restaurant. 

The complaint was filed contemporaneously with a consent decree, which was approved by the Court on April 1, 1993. On July 2, 1993, the Court, on its own motion, consolidated the case with Ridgeway v. Denny's Corporation, a class action filed on March 24, 1993, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Both actions alleged violations of the Public Accommodations Act in relation to Denny's treatment of African American customers. The class action also alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), California Business and Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq., California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq. and California Civil Code §§ 1750 et seq.

Following execution of the original decree, numerous complaints of racial discrimination were submitted to the Plaintiff Class and the United States. The United States investigated the complaints and, on May 24, 1994, submitted an amended consent decree to expand the protections to customers and prevent future discrimination. The amended consent decree prohibited Denny's from engaging in discriminatory treatment of African Americans and established procedures for compliance, including a comprehensive non-discrimination training program, as well as provisions for notice, advertising, testing, monitoring and record keeping. It also required the defendants to establish a $28 million settlement fund for the plaintiff class, and appointment of a Special Master. The Amended Consent Decree was given final approval by the Court (Judge James Ware) on July 29, 1994. 

After preliminary approval of the Amended Consent Decree, the parties received reports that a number of individuals and organizations in California were charging fees for services related to the preparation and/or filing of claims in the case. The court (Judge Ware) issued several cease and desist orders to counsel concerning processing of potential claimants. Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 525553 (N.D.Cal. Sept. 22, 1994.), Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 564571 (N.D.Cal. Oct. 3, 1994)).  The court (Judge Ware) also issued orders vacating depositions scheduled by class counsel. Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 665250 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 3, 1994), Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 665243 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 8, 1994), and denying requests of non-party lawyers to amend the judgment and get for fees defending motions to compel. Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 665414 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 8, 1994). The court (Judge Ware) further denied a second motion from the lawyers, vacated a scheduled hearing, and ordered the lawyers to prepare a list of any Denny's claimants who had signed contingency fees with them. Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 669935 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 18, 1994).

In July and August of 1996 the court issued orders clarifying the confidentiality provisions of the decree and modifying dates for distribution of residual funds. After several years of status reports, the United States submitted a final report on January 16, 2001, recommending early dismissal of the consent decree. On April 4, 2001, the Court (Judge Ware) terminated the consent decree's provisions effective November 11, 2000, and dismissed the case.

PC-OH-0010,"On 06/28/1993, inmates at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility filed a Section 1983 class action suit, pro se, in the Southern District of Ohio against officials in Youngstown, Ohio of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.  Plaintiffs' claims were related to the treatment of prisoners during the prison riot that occurred in April 1993.  Plaintiffs alleged that defendants locked as many as ten inmates in a cell, failed to protect them from violence, did not provide them with water or working toilets, used excessive force, destroyed personal property, and denied medical care.  

In December 1993, Magistrate Judge Robert A. Steinberg appointed several private lawyers and certified the class.  By the summer of 1994, counsel, along with their expert Steven Martin, negotiated an end to the post-riot lockdown of general population inmates.  By February 1995, counsel negotiated with Defendants for a special Rules Infraction Board to handle the cases of inmates against whom administrative charges for riot-related, violent misconduct were filed.

Following extensive discovery, the parties reached an agreement and signed the Class Action Memorandum of Understanding in January 1997. The settlement included two major parts.  First, the settlement established terms to improve the """"quality of life"""" including: single-celling maximum security inmates; modifying the inmate classification system; improving racial and cultural relations; securing at least forty hours of out-of-cell time per week;  and instituting new state-wide directives on religious practices.  Second, the settlement established a $4.1 million fund, from which inmate damage claims, attorneys' fees and expenses would be paid.  The  case was dismissed conditional on completion of the reforms specified in the settlement agreement.  Following a fairness hearing, the District Court (Judge S. Arthur Spiegel) approved the settlement in April 1997.  

Michael R. Barrett was named Special Master and has filed several status reports regarding the distribution of the fund.  However, extensive litigation  continued regarding the distribution of the fund and attorneys' fees.  

On December 12, 1999, the District Court (Judge Spiegel) approved a recommendation by the claims administrator that the two class representatives be paid $7,500 apiece.
The stated basis for these awards was that ""the class representatives performed important work on behalf of the other members of class and class counsel,"" serving as a ""crucial link for class members and counsel throughout the proceedings"" and keeping the ""class members generally informed in the progress of the case and relay[ing] information back to
class counsel."" In a subsequent order, the district court stayed its grant of incentive awards pending appeal. 

In 2001, the Sixth Circuit (Judge David A. Nelson) reversed the district court's decision to grant incentive awards to the two named plaintiffs and place all inmates' claim determinations under protective order.  In re Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, 2001 WL 1667267 (6th Cir. 2001).  

On November 4, 2002, Judge Spiegel entered an order granting class counsel's request for an order increasing the awards to class members pro rata and ordering the settlement master/trustee to distribute $500,000 to be awarded on a pro rata basis on each claimant's previous award totals.  In 2004, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court's disbursement of unassigned funds to certain prisoner-class members.  The court held that the settlement agreement did not authorize the district court to make a pro rata distribution of the remaining settlement funds.  Morris v. Voinovich, 2004 WL 1745781 (6th Cir. 2004).  

On January 20, 2005, Judge Spiegel approved the joint motion of the parties to distribute the remainder of the settlement fund.  The remaining funds are to be used to support two re-entry caseworkers who will work with the class members to help them succeed on release. The court also acknowledged that sufficient effort had been made to attempt to track down all members of the class, and that the funds allocated to the former inmates who could not be traced were returned to the general pool. A second order on the same day awarded attorney’s fees to counsel representing the class. Funds were distributed between 2005 and 2007. The case is now closed.

Class counsel or the individual involved may contest such exclusion. By stipulation of all parties. * * * * * * While prisons are dangerous places, this does not absolve prison officials from their duties. “[ Id. The work involved in achieving each of these goals is detailed below.\n\nA. ENDING THE POST–RIOT LOCKDOWN OF GENERAL POPULATION INMATES In the Spring of 1994, almost a year after the riot, Class Counsel, along with their hired expert Steve Martin, negotiated with Defendants to lift the lockdown of the general population inmates at SOCF. The law generally favors the settlement of complex class actions. Enterprise Energy Corp. v. Columbia Gas Transmission Corp., 137 F.R.D. 240, 246 (S.D.Ohio 1991); see also 2 Herbert Newberg & Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions, § 11.41 (3d ed.1992).\n[2] There are three steps which must be taken by the court in order to approve a settlement: (1) the court must preliminarily approve the proposed settlement, (2) members of the class must be given notice of the proposed settlement, and (3) after holding a hearing, the court must give its final approval of the settlement based on a finding that the settlement is fair, reasonable and adequate. Williams v. Vukovich, 720 F.2d 909, 921 (6th Cir.1983); Enterprise Energy Corp., 137 F.R.D. at 245; In re Dun & Bradstreet Credit Services Customer Litigation, 130 F.R.D. 366, 369 (S.D.Ohio 1990).\n[3] [4] The district court bases its preliminary approval of a proposed settlement upon its familiarity with the issues and evidence of the case as well as the arms-length nature of the negotiations prior to the settlement. They have, in essence, waived their right to seek attorneys’ fees pursuant to § 1988 by settling all Plaintiffs’ claims with Defendants.\n[12] Rather, the source of the fee award more closely resembles the award of fees in “common fund” cases.6 The “common fund doctrine” provides that “a litigant or lawyer who recovers a common fund for the benefit of persons other than himself or his client is entitled to a reasonable attorney’s fee from the fund as a whole.” 1933, 1939,\n\n76 L.Ed.2d 40 (1983).\n\nThe interest of class counsel in obtaining fees is adverse to the interest of the class in obtaining recovery because the fees come out of the common fund set up for the benefit of the class. Typically, the percentage awarded ranges from 20 to 50 percent of the common fund created. At bottom, the court must ensure that class counsel are fairly compensated for the amount of work done as well as the results achieved. Finally, in civil rights actions under § 1983, such as this one, the court usually utilizes the lodestar method for determining a fee award under §\n8\n\n\x0cIn re Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, 173 F.R.D. 205 (1997)\n\n1988.\nB. CALCULATING CLASS COUNSEL’S FEE AWARD Class Counsel request an award of attorneys’ fees in the amount of $1.4 million and an award of expenses in the amount of $308,613.41. ( It is not always improper, however, for the class representatives to receive an award of a different amount as compared to the other class members. 155 F.R.D. 116, 120–21 (E.D.Pa.1994); 2 Herbert Newberg and Alba Conte, Newberg on Class Actions, § 11.38 at 11–80 (3d ed.1992); Jerold S. Solovy, et al., “ Defendants argue that the limitations in this paragraph, which are also reflected in Paragraph 19 of the General Protocol, are the sole means by which a class member can receive compensation from the Settlement Fund. Inmate-on-inmate violence has been a recurring problem at SOCF since it opened in 1972.\n20. The parties propose that the residual funds be used to support two reentry caseworkers who will work with the class members to help them succeed on release.

The court also cited the unwillingness of the Attorney General’s Office to undertake the responsibility of ensuring that the judgments are in fact valid.\nUnaware of the state court injunction, the district court then ordered that class members be permitted to assign or designate third parties as recipients of their awards, and that the designations be made public.

PN-NY-0011,"On May 21, 2011, plaintiffs, two men of color, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and state law against the City of New York in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, Foley Square. The plaintiffs, represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union, asked the court for injunction and compensatory relief, claiming that their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the New York City Police Department (NYPD) had violated their rights by unreasonably searching them during routine livery cab stops.

On September 3, 2010, at 11:30 P.M., one plaintiff, a lawyer in the Bronx, was leaving work and chose to use a livery cab. The cab was enrolled in the Taxi/Livery Robbery Inspection Program (TRIP), which gave consent for the cab to be stopped and inspected by the NYPD. The cab displayed a decal that indicated enrollment in TRIP.  The NYPD stopped the livery cab, and ordered the plaintiff out of the vehicle. The plaintiff protested the search without reasonable suspicion, but the police indicated that enrollment in the TRIP program gave them the right to search passengers in the livery cab.  Nothing was found.

On October 30, 2010, at 3:00 A.M., the second plaintiff, who was a manager at a popular radio station and a comedian, was returning to his home in Brooklyn in a livery cab.  This cab was also enrolled in TRIP. The car was stopped and the plaintiff ordered to exit the vehicle, at which point the plaintiff's person and belongings were searched.  Again, nothing was found. 

The plaintiffs' case was accepted by the NYCLU and the New York University School of Law Civil Rights Clinic, and a complaint was filed alleging that the search of passengers in livery cabs without reasonable suspicion was unconstitutional.

On May 14, 2012, the Court (Judge Richard M. Berman) entered a stipulation and order of dismissal, because the case had settled.  The Settlement contained $10,000 relief for each plaintiff ($20,000 total), $38,000 in attorney's fees, and injunctive-like provisions.  The NYPD agreed to suspend its routine searching of passengers of vehicles that were pulled over as part of the TRIPS program. The NYPD further agreed that it would only search passengers when reasonable suspicion of a violent crime existed.  Furthermore, the NYPD provided information that it was amending its training manual, informing officers at roll-call citywide (repeating it for 10 day periods, for three times over the next year), and issuing an operations order communicating the order to not search passengers absent reasonable suspicion of a violent crime during a TRIP stop.

The case was dismissed with the approval of the settlement.

Rather, the NYPD is using a program that allows it to stop livery cars to ask the drivers about their well-being and to visually inspect the cars as a license to remove passengers from the cars and to question, frisk, and search the passengers and to search their possessions.\n2. both instances the officers who questioned, frisked, and searched Mr. Battle and Mr. Pujara stated that this was routine NYPD practice and claimed that each man had consented to this treatment by riding in a livery car that was participating in the livery-car safety program. Defendant PHILIP FACENDA is a member of the NYPD who participated in the\n- encounter with Mr. Battle. Defendant MICHAEL MILLER is a member of the NYPD who participated in the\nencounter with Mr. Battle. He is sued in his official and personal capacities. One of the officers asked the driver if everything in the vehicle was alright. Mr. Battle thought of incidents where African-Americans were killed or injured by NYPD officers without provocation. The NYPD officers had no lawful reason to detain, question, frisk, or search him.\n34. He knew that the officers mistreated him and had no right to do what they had done to him.\n6\n\n\x0cCase 1:11-cv-03599-RMB -HBP Document 19 Filed 07/21/11 Page 7 of 14\n35.

Mr. Pujara had not consented to be searched. Finally, Mr. Pujara was allowed to walk away from the car, though the officers did not expressly consent to it and he was fearful as he stepped away from them.

DR-TX-0003,"On April 25, 2016, three individuals that were blind and enrolled in the Barbri bar exam preparation course filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiffs brought this suit against BarBri Inc., aka Barbri Bar Review, a company that sells and provides products for bar exam preparation. The plaintiffs alleged that Barbri violated the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 et seq.) and the Texas Human Resource Code §§ 121.002-.003. The plaintiffs, represented by Texas Civil Rights Project and Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights/Urban Affairs, sought injunctive, monetary, and declaratory relief as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. This case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Renee Harris Toliver.

The three plaintiffs were all enrolled in the Barbri bar preparation course and relied on Barbri to prepare for the bar examination. The Barbri bar preparation course provided online bar review resources including online live chat to match Barbri students with tutors, an online planner, study outlines, online lecture notes, and online lecture videos. The website, however, was not compatible with the software that the plaintiffs relied on to access the internet, like Job Access With Speech (“JAWS”) screen readers. The plaintiffs requested reasonable accommodation, but BarBri did not provide them. 

On July 1, 2016, the defendant moved to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The plaintiff amended their complaint on July 19, 2016. This new complaint added more factual allegations and slightly modified the definition of the sought class. The amended class definition was as follows: “All legally blind individuals nationwide who, on or after April 25, 2014, took, plan to take or attempted to take a Barbri bar review course at a time when Barbri’s website, mobile application, or other course materials was or is not fully accessible to legally blind students, or who have   been discouraged from taking the Barbri bar review course due to such inaccessibility.” 

The defendant again moved to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on October 3, 2016. The plaintiffs moved to certify a class on February 10, 2017. The court never ruled on this motion.

In October 2017, the parties underwent settlement discussions. Eventually the parties reached a confidential Settlement Agreement. Then on January 19, 2018, the parties jointly moved for a stipulation of dismissal and sought approval of a consent decree.

Three days later, the court approved the parties’ consent decree. The parties agreed that the court would retain jurisdiction for three years to ensure compliance with this decree. The consent decree prohibited the defendant from engaging in disability discrimination, required the defendant to comply with the ADA, and required the defendant to undergo an accessibility audit to ensure that all accessibility barriers for screen readers were removed. The defendant also agreed to provide accessibility training to all development team employees and to reform its procedures for implementing reasonable accommodations when students request accommodations.

The consent decree remains in force as of May 2020.

Plaintiff Claire Stanley is a resident of Silver Spring, Maryland and took the Pennsylvania bar exam in July 2015. As she did not pass, she plans to take the bar exam again in July 2016. It is a national voice for young leaders with disabilities. She applied to attend law school during college and was delighted to begin law school after her graduation. Claire realized that she wanted to practice disability rights law or general civil rights law, and never strayed from this goal during law school. His interest in the connection between policy and the law inspired him to join the debate team in high school.\n14. He will need to pass the bar in order to achieve his goal of practicing political law.\n18. He also uses an iPhone with VoiceOver to access all of the menus and applications on his phone.\n19. Christopher always had an interest in government and political science, as well as the law. As an undergraduate, he majored in violin performance and worked as a professional violinist for a few years. But his passion for law drove him to attend law school.\n21.

The central question in this case concerns whether BarBri’s bar review course violated the ADA and Chapter 121 by failing to provide proper auxiliary aids and services, make reasonable accommodations, and maintaining a policy and practice of failing to make its course materials accessible to blind students. The relief sought in this action primarily consists of a declaration that BarBri violated the rights of Plaintiffs Stanley, Manners, and Stewart, and all of the other members of the class under the ADA and the Texas Human Resources Code, an order requiring BarBri to make its course materials accessible to legally blind students, and an order requiring BarBri to uniformly compensate students who have been subjected to BarBri’s inaccessible course materials.\nAdequacy 58.

IM-GA-0017,"This federal class action lawsuit sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief for over 60 immigrant women who were detained in ICE custody at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia. The plaintiffs claimed that they were subjected to medical abuse while in ICE custody including nonconsensual hysterectomies, overly aggressive gynecological care, and medically unnecessary procedures. In addition to the medical abuse itself, the plaintiffs sought relief against federal officials and the local employees of the ICE jail who, the plaintiffs claimed, engaged in a widespread conspiracy to silence the detainees from sharing their abuse with the public and retaliated against women who spoke out about the conditions at the detention center. 

<i>Procedural Background: </i>
This federal class action lawsuit commenced on November 9, 2020, with a petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus and Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order filed by Yanira Oldaker in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia (in Valdosta). At the time of the initial filing, Yanira Oldaker was a detainee of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC also referred to below as “the ICE jail”) in Ocilla, Georgia. The November 9 motion named ICE, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as defendants. 

On November 16 and 17, 2020, two other women detained at ICDC filed separate habeas petitions in the same district court. (Trial dockets 7:20-cv-00231 and 7:20-cv-00237). On November 18, 2020, District Judge W. Louis Sands ordered the two new habeas petitions to be consolidated into the Oldaker case which had been referred to Magistrate Judge Stephen Hyles. A fourth ICDC detainee joined the consolidated action on November 23, 2020, also seeking a writ of habeas corpus.

On November 25, 2020, the district court granted a consent motion to revise a scheduling order agreed to by the four plaintiffs and the defendants who now included ICE, DHS, DOJ, and ICDC. In the revised scheduling order, the government agreed to not deport any of the four plaintiffs or any other ICDC detainees who wished to file similar habeas petitions or motions for temporary restraining orders at least until a hearing on the motions for temporary restraining orders was held. The plaintiffs agreed to file a consolidated habeas petition and consolidated motion for temporary restraining order for all individuals at ICDC with substantially similar factual allegations as themselves by December 21, 2020. 

<i>The Amended Habeas Petition/Class Action Complaint, and the Amended Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order:</i>
The plaintiffs met the deadline they agreed to and submitted an amended habeas petition together with a class action complaint (the complaint) and an updated emergency motion for a temporary restraining order on December 21, 2020. 

Represented by the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, Morningside Heights Legal Services, Project South, a small Atlanta based law firm, and law school clinics from Boston University, Harvard, Texas A&M, and the University of Georgia as counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief. In the complaint, the plaintiffs described themselves as current or former ICDC detainees who were each subjected to “non-consensual, medically unindicated, and/or invasive gynecological procedures” by the physician assigned to the ICE jail.  

The complaint set out three main categories of plaintiffs: 1) a group of nine women who were detained at ICDC at the time the complaint was filed, 2) four women previously detained at ICDC who had been either deported from the U.S. or released from the ICE jail at the time the complaint was filed, 3) a putative class of at least 60 women who were subjected to similar medical abuse at ICDC as the named plaintiffs. The list of defendants was extensive and includes federal agencies, federal officials, employees at ICDC, the corporate defendant LaSalle Southeast, LLC which owned and operated ICDC at the time of the complaint, and the Hospital Authority of Irwin County which employed the defendant physician Mahendra Amin. 

The complaint included 21 claims for relief. The first was a habeas claim for the release of the nine detained plaintiffs from unlawful detention under 28 U.S.C. §§2241, 2243 and the common law to remedy the “egregious and systematic retaliatory behavior” of the defendants. 

In claims two through four, the plaintiffs sought a remedy for violations of their First Amendment Rights. The second claim alleged retaliatory conduct by federal respondents against ICDC detainees in violation of the First Amendment rights of speech and petition. The plaintiffs claimed that their testimony to federal investigators and communications to the press regarding medical abuse was met by adverse actions by federal respondents including deportations and attempted deportations of individual plaintiffs and putative class members, use of force, solitary confinement, and denial of privileges at the ICDC. The plaintiffs claimed that their exercise of free speech was “chilled” and that they suffered physical and/or psychological harm. The second claim sought damages against federal respondents pursuant to Bivens, declaratory relief finding their actions in violation of the First Amendment, and injunctive relief prohibiting further retaliation by federal officials against the exercise by plaintiffs of First Amendment protected conduct. The third claim is similar to the second but described the retaliation committed by ICDC, LaSalle, and their employees/officials including the defendant physician and is based on the incorporation of the First Amendment in the Fourteenth Amendment as a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. §1983. The retaliatory conduct committed by these non-federal actors included the placement of plaintiffs in solitary confinement, cell restriction, physical assault, assault of handcuffed detainees, threats of deprivation of property and commissary to hunger strikers, denial of access to the law library, monitoring of phone calls, destruction of outgoing correspondence, and the making of false claims to congressional investigators. Plaintiffs sought the same injunctive and declaratory relief against state officials as they did against the federal respondents and ask for both compensatory and punitive damages. As an alternative to the third claim, claim four restates the allegations of retaliation committed by the non-federal respondents but argued that if claim three failed, the court should find that the ICDC and LaSalle employees/officials were acting under color of federal authority and can be sued for damages pursuant to Bivens. 

In the fifth, sixth, and seventh claims of the complaint, the plaintiffs sought relief for violations of their Fifth Amendment rights. The fifth claim sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief against federal officials with the damages claim based on Bivens. The plaintiffs alleged that the federal officials who facilitated their confinement at ICDC were either motivated by evil intent or callously/recklessly indifferent to the medical abuse they endured in violation of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of reasonable safety and freedom from punitive confinement for people in civil immigration detention. The sixth claim sought the same type of relief as the fifth but is against the ICDC respondents and was based on the Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process and 42 U.S.C §1983. Like the fourth claim’s alternative theory for damages under Bivens, the seventh claim similarly argued that if the court finds that the ICDC respondents were operating solely under color of federal law, they should still be liable for damages for violating the plaintiffs’ rights to substantive due process. 

The eighth claim sought declaratory and injunctive relief against all defendants in their official capacities for violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act with regards to the detained plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged that the detained plaintiffs (all of whom have underlying medical conditions which qualify as disabilities under the Rehab Act) were excluded and/or denied benefits of the “services, programs, and activities” within ICDC. The plaintiffs argued that the only “reasonable accommodation” that would have mitigated their disabilities would have been released from detention and that because they were still detained at ICDC at the time the complaint was filed, their ongoing detention violated the Rehab Act. 

The ninth claim was against the federal defendants for violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The plaintiffs claimed that the deportation of two of the detainees who provided information about medical abuse to a <a href= https://projectsouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OIG-ICDC-Complaint-1.pdf> whistleblower</a> ICDC employee was a violation of ICE’s own policy (ICE Policy Number 10076.1) to not remove individuals from the U.S. “in the midst of a legitimate effort to protect their civil rights or civil liberties.” This disregard of its own policy by ICE amounted to a violation of the APA’s guarantee of judicial review for persons who suffer a legal wrong because of an agency action and also violated regulations promulgated under the INA which prohibit the deportation of individuals needed in the US for any investigation “being, or soon to be, conducted by any official executive, legislative, or judicial agency…”. 8 C.F.R. §215.3(h). The tenth claim was also based in APA violations by federal officials. Plaintiffs alleged that federal defendants failed to follow the Performance Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) requirements with regards to the medical care at ICDC amounting to an unlawful agency action under the APA. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy the violations alleged in their ninth and tenth claims. 

In the eleventh claim, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated 42 U.S.C. §1985 by 1) conspiring to deter detainees from attending/testifying in a pending federal court proceeding and 2) conspiring to retaliate against witnesses/participants in federal court proceedings. The plaintiffs supported these conspiracy claims with extensive allegations including examples of expedited deportations, forced transfers of detainees out of the main ICDC facility during a September 2020 visit by a Congressional delegation, and phone call monitoring all of which commenced after ICDC received notice in mid-September 2020 that federal agencies were investigating it for medical abuse. The plaintiffs sought damages, injunctive, and declaratory relief to remedy these claims. 

In the twelfth claim, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against federal defendants for violating the Fifth Amendment prohibition on deportation of essential witnesses in civil proceedings.

The thirteenth claim requested a grant of bail to the plaintiffs who were petitioning for habeas. The fourteenth claim is for breach of contract. Here, the plaintiffs argued that both the federal and ICDC defendants breached the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) established for the administration of the ICE jail by failing to abide by the terms of the PBNDS, not providing appropriate medical care, providing medical treatment without informed consent, and by not providing language accessibility during medical care to detainees who did not speak English. The plaintiffs claimed that they were the intended third-party beneficiaries of the IGA and that they were owed damages to remedy the breach as well as injunctive relief to enforce the contract. 

Counts fifteen through twenty were tort claims, listed as follows; 15) negligent hiring or retention against ICDC, LaSalle, and Irwin County Hospital; 16) gross negligence against ICDC and its officials; 17) medical battery against the defendant physician and Irwin County Hospital; 18) medical malpractice against the defendant physician and Irwin County Hospital; 19) intentional infliction of emotional distress against ICDC and its officials; 20) negligent infliction of emotional distress against ICDC and its officials. The twenty-first claim was for attorneys’ fees and costs. It was brought under Georgia law against all ICDC defendants who committed intentional torts.  

In addition to the complaint, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and petition for writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum. The temporary restraining order sought by the plaintiffs would have enjoined retaliation against them by federal and ICDC officials including use of force, solitary confinement, denial of privileges, and deportation. If granted by the court, the habeas writs sought in the emergency motion would have ordered the defendants to make the plaintiffs available for any hearings deemed necessary by the court. In the emergency motion, the plaintiffs also asked for the release from ICDC of all detained plaintiffs and members of the putative class as an alternative to not granting the temporary restraining order and habeas petition. 

<i>Proceedings and Factual Changes Since the December 2020 Filings:</i>
No district court rulings had been made on the merits of any of the plaintiffs’ claims as of June 8, 2021. Only the corporate defendant, LaSalle, has filed an answer to the complaint (submitted April 15, 2021). On June 8, the government submitted a notice of new facts in opposition to the December 21, 2020, emergency motion for temporary restraining order. Though this document is not available for purchase on PACER, it likely has to do with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’ <a href= https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/20/ice-close-two-detention-centers> announcement </a> of the end of ICE’s contract with ICDC on May 20, 2021. Interestingly, according to a June 3, 2021, report by <a href= https://theintercept.com/2021/06/03/ice-irwin-closing-open-detainees> the Intercept, </a> at least 34 ICE detainees were transferred to ICDC the week after DHS claimed to have terminated the contract. As for the status of the plaintiffs in this case, the National Immigration Project of the NLG <a href= https://nipnlg.org/pr/2021_22Jan_oldaker-v-giles.html> reported </a> that all of the women who claimed medical abuse by the defendant physician had been released from ICDC as early as January 22, 2021. This claim is further corroborated by a <a href= https://www.detentionwatchnetwork.org/pressroom/releases/2021/after-years-advocacy-no-immigrant-women-are-currently-detained-irwin-county> press release </a> from Detention Watch Network that announced that no women were being detained at ICDC as of April 29, 2021.

During her detention at ICDC, Respondent Amin had subjected her to non-consensual, invasive gynecological procedures and repeatedly pressured her into undergoing a hysterectomy, which she avoided on the day of the scheduled surgery only because she had tested positive for COVID-19.25 On September 15, 2020, Unnamed ICDC Officer #1 specifically asked Ms. Floriano Navarro whether she had spoken up. She felt pain upon urinating and when wiping herself.\n135.

During this appointment, Respondent Amin told Ms. Terrazas Silas he would have to remove her entire uterus because there was a tumor the size of a coconut. Jane Doe #5 has been detained at Irwin County since June 18, 2020. No one in the room explained what was happening to Jane Doe #6 or why Amin had invaded her body with equipment and his fingers.\n246. In addition, women who tried to share their experiences about the strike over the phone had their calls dropped in mid-sentence. Respondent Amin informed her that, despite the surgery, Jane Doe #15 still had fibroids in her uterus. She was deported on September 16, 2020, without warning. On September 15, 2020, the guards took her to see Respondent Amin without warning. However, Ms. Ndonga reprinted her sign and hung it again. Ms. Reyes Ramirez fled Honduras to the United States six years ago in order to escape an abusive expartner. When she kept speaking up, the medical staff tried to put her in the medical room, which is akin to solitary confinement, in order to silence her.\n413. Ms. Haug was pregnant when she arrived at ICDC. Respondent Amin told Ms. Haug that she had cysts and endometriosis. Respondent Amin pressured Ms. Haug to get the Depo shot because he determined that the cysts were not shrinking. Jane Doe #28 did not understand what the form was for, but the interpreter told Jane Doe #28 that she needed to sign it, so that Respondent Amin could perform surgery. After her surgery, she woke up and saw three cuts on her abdomen. Petitioners repeat and re-allege the allegations contained in the preceding paragraphs of this Petition as if fully set forth herein.

IM-GA-0014,"COVID-19 Summary: Over a dozen non-citizens detained in immigration detention facilities, who had underlying medical conditions rendering them particularly susceptible to COVID-19 complications, filed this suit on April 3, 2020 against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Atlanta, GA, seeking immediate release. The court granted a motion to dismiss and terminated the case on April 7, 2020. <hr>

On April 3, 2020, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and private counsel filed suit on behalf of thirteen individuals detained in three U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention or processing centers in Georgia. The plaintiffs named as defendants ICE, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and various officers of those departments. The plaintiffs asked the court to issue a writ of habeas corpus, or in the alternative, issue injunctive relief ordering the immediate release of the plaintiffs. In addition, the plaintiffs sought a declaration stating that the continued detention of individuals at increased risk for severe illness including COVID-19, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Further, the plaintiffs asked for an award of attorneys' fees. 

The complaint alleged that the medical conditions or underlying diseases of these detained individuals, like diabetes and hypertension, made them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. The facilities where ICE has detained the plaintiffs lacked access to critical care necessary for treating serious cases of COVID-19.

According to the complaint, imprisoned populations, including those in ICE detention facilities, pose a higher risk for the spread of infectious disease. The plaintiffs stated that in March 2020, over 3,000 medical professionals across the United States urged ICE to release individuals and families to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among detainees as well as facility staff. The complaint also explained that social distancing measures and large-scale quarantines as recommended by the Center for Disease Control are ""nearly impossible"" in immigration detention due to overcrowding, poor availability of hygiene products, and lack of access to adequate medical services.

In addition to the complaint, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order as well as an emergency writ of habeas corpus and requested an immediate hearing given the time-sensitive nature of the case. The plaintiffs alleged that because the government knew or should have known of the substantial risk to the plaintiffs, the continued detention of these individuals demonstrated deliberate indifference, thereby violating the plaintiffs' right to Due Process under the Fifth Amendment.

On April 6, 2020 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or in the alternative, a transfer of venue. Additionally, the defendants asked the court to sever the plaintiffs' claims by facility.

The plaintiffs, in response, filed a motion for voluntary dismissal on April 6, 2020. The motion, without conceding that this court lacked jurisdiction, gave notice of the dismissal in the interest of expediting emergency relief. The motion stated that the plaintiffs would seek relief in other federal district courts. <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17609""> <i>Martinez v.

Violation of Fifth Amendment Right to Substantive Due Process (Unlawful Punishment; Freedom from Cruel Treatment and Conditions of Confinement)..75\nVIII. He has been in ICE custody since approximately January 2018. Petitioner Sarai Hernandez is a citizen of Honduras who has been detained at Irwin since March 2020. As a consequence of his health conditions, he is at high risk for severe illness or death if he contracts COVID-19.\n17. He is currently in a wheelchair due to his conditions. He is sued in his official capacity.\n23. Patients can go from being medically stable with no need for supplemental oxygen to requiring intubation and ventilator-assisted breathing within 24 hours. poorer health than the general population, even at younger ages. On the Diamond Princess cruise ship, for example, approximately 700 passengers and crew on board were infected over the course of three weeks despite the initiation of quarantine protocols.\n53. Preliminary data suggests that a person with COVID-19 is most infectious during the early stage of the disease.69 Early, proactive action is necessary to prevent the virus’s spread. The local and regional hospitals near Stewart, Folkston, and Irwin are ill-equipped to handle COVID-19 outbreaks within these facilities, heightening the risks for Petitioners.\n97. Reports by Petitioners and other detained immigrants belie ICE’s assertions that it has implemented “[c]omprehensive protocols” for the protection of staff and patients, including the appropriate use of [PPE].” This puts not only Petitioners but ICE’s own personnel and the larger community at risk of a preventable disaster.\nF. Petitioners Are Particularly Vulnerable to Serious Illness or Death if Infected by COVID-19 and Should Be Released from Detention.\n115. He did not receive any treatment for his hand. Mr. Jammeh suffers from diabetes for which he requires insulin pills and blood sugar checks, as well as a special diabetic diet that he is not provided at Irwin. She and her younger brother, Petitioner Tomas Hernandez, fled to the United States seeking asylum in June 2019. Ms. Hernandez has suffered from asthma her entire life, which has given her respiratory distress and weakens her immune system. An attorney helped him apply for parole and bond, but they were denied.\n134. Mr. Fernandez has been detained at Folkston since December 2019. Mr. Fernandez is now suffering flu-like symptoms in a facility where he cannot practice social distancing, he is not provided sufficient soap, testing for COVID-19 is unavailable, and staff are not taking precautions to protect him from infection.\n146. Mr. Hernandez is an 18-year-old citizen of Honduras. As he is unable to communicate his needs to others, his sister believes he it is likely that he is not getting the medical care he needs.\n161. Mr. Hernandez is critically vulnerable to COVID-19 because of his significant health problems as well as his intellectual disability and inability to communicate clearly with staff at the detention center without the help of his sister. Mr. Owusu is a 40-year-old citizen of Ghana. Upon his release he plans to self-quarantine with his uncle in Houston, Texas.\n165.

ED-HI-0003,"On July 27, 2010, four students with disabilities and the Hawaii Disability Rights Center filed this class action against the Hawaii Department of Education seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs, represented by Hawaii Disability Rights Center, contended that the Department was failing to comply with its obligations to provide a Free Accessible Public Education (FAPE) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and their right to a discrimination-free education under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Susan Oki Mollway. 

At the time the complaint was filed, the disabled individuals who brought the suit were over twenty but under twenty-two years old and had previously received a FAPE under the IDEA. However, following the establishment of a new Hawaii Law, Act 163, these individuals were denied a FAPE because they were over twenty years of age. 

The plaintiffs moved for class certification and a preliminary injunction. District Judge David Alan Ezra signed an order granting in part and denying in part the motion for class certification on March 15, 2011. 272 F.R.D. 541. The judge also issued an order denying plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2011 WL 2746800. Defendants then moved for a motion to dismiss or in the alternative, for summary judgment, and the plaintiffs renewed their motion for a preliminary injunction and moved for summary judgment. Judge Ezra then issued an order denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, granting in part and denying in part the defendant's motion to dismiss, and denying plaintiff's renewed motion for preliminary relief. 817 F.Supp.2d 1182.

In 2012, the case went to a bench trial. Judge Alan Ezra held that the plaintiffs failed to prove the Hawaii Department of Education violated the IDEA, ACA, and Rehabilitation Act and entered judgment for the defendants. 2012 WL 1082250. The case was then appealed to the Ninth Circuit. On August 28, 2013, the Ninth Circuit announced its conclusion, affirming in part and reversing in part. 728 F.3d 982. The court found that the State of Hawaii offered public education to nondisabled students between the ages of 20 and 22 through its Community Schools for Adults. The court held that so long as the State continued to provide such an education to nondisabled students under 22, it was required under IDEA to provide a FAPE to disabled students in the same age bracket. The court reversed and remanded the case on the IDEA count. The court affirmed the district court's finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the Department was required to make such changes as a ""reasonable accommodation."" Accordingly, the court affirmed the lower court's judgement in favor of the Department on the ACA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  The court also awarded costs on appeal to the Plaintiffs. 

After being remanded to district court, and after the case was reassigned to Judge Susan Oki Mollway, the class was recertified. Subsequently, the parties began settlement conferences. On December 8, 2017, Judge Oki Mollway issued an order approving settlement for class members. As part of the settlement, the Department of Education agreed to fund the requisite services and pay $8.2 million dollars to class members, $1.5 million for attorneys' fees, and up to $250,000 to class counsel for future services rendered in relation to the administration of the settlement. 

The administration of the settlement continues. The case remains open. ","Signed by JUDGE SUSAN OKI MOLLWAY on 7/27/2010.

Palm Springs Alpine Estates, Inc., 329 F.2d 909, 914 (9th Cir. The Court will exclude them from its analysis moving forward.\nC. Typicality The typicality criterion requires that the representative Plaintiffs’\nclaims or defenses be of the same nature as the rest of the class.

Both the University of\n5 Of course, the fact that the Community Schools for Adults meet the definition of “secondary schools” under the IDEA does not mean that Hawaii could comply with the IDEA simply by amending its laws to exclude adult-education programs from the ambit of “secondary education.” On March 15, 2011, the Court granted in part Plaintiffs’ Motion for Class Certification and certified the following class:\nAll individuals residing in the State of Hawaii who over the age of 20 on or before the first day of the school year (or who will imminently be over the age of 20 on that date) but under the age of 22 who are entitled to receive special education and related services from Defendant the Hawaii Department of Education under the Individuals with Disabilities Act. ( 2–5, 6, 10, 12; TR at 13:24–14:3, 52:12–53:11.)

JC-NM-0006,"On August 22, 2005, a female plaintiff represented by attorneys Mark E. Merin of Sacramento, California, Andrew C. Schwartz of Walnut Creek, California, and Robert R. Rothstein of Santa Fe, New Mexico, filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for New Mexico, challenging the strip search and visual body cavity search policy in effect at the Lincoln County Detention Center.  The policy at issue required that all persons housed in the Detention Center undergo strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned and without reasonable suspicion that the searches would produce contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff maintained that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as state constitutional provisions and tort law, and sought monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and class certification.  Named as defendants were Cornell Companies, Inc. and/or Correctional Systems, Inc. (""CSI"") (the company that had contracted to operate the Detention Center), the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners, and past and present Lincoln County Sheriffs.  A First Amended Complaint, filed on June 28, 2006, added individuals defendants associated with Cornell/CSI and deleted the county sheriffs as defendants.

Almost immediately after the suit was filed, Cornell issued revised strip search policies for the Lincoln County Detention Center. 

The parties engaged in extensive discovery, which included exchange of documents, interrogatories, and depositions.  The parties took a statistical sampling of the files of approximately 3,000 persons booked at Lincoln County Detention Center during the period from August 22, 2002, until August 31, 2005 and estimated that  approximately 1,200 persons who were arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, were strip searched.

On July 12 and 13, 2006, the parties participated in mediation and arrived at an agreed Stipulation of Settlement.  Under the Stipulation, the settlement class was defined as: ""all persons arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, on or between August 22, 2002, and August 31, 2005, who were strip searched at the Lincoln County Detention Center prior to arraignment.""  Defendants agreed to pay $1.6 million for settlement of the class claims.  Of that fund, $750,000 was earmarked for distribution to qualified claimants that submitted a claim form.  The named plaintiff was to receive $100,000.  $600,000 was allocated for attorneys' fees and $150,000.00 to cover the costs of claims administration. 

 

The District Court (District Judge William P. Johnson) granted preliminary approval of the class action settlement and conditionally certified the settlement class.  Following a fairness hearing on November 29, 2007, the settlement was approved.

Until approximately April, 2005, Holm was employed by CSI and/or Cornell as the Warden of LCDC. During his tenure as Warden, Holm was the immediate supervisor of Defendants Peter Morales, Lucy Vega and Does 1 - 50. In regard to Plaintiff’s § 1983 claims, Jeffers is sued in both his individual and official capacities.\n-6-\n\n\x0c9. At all times material hereto, Vegas was an employee of CSI and/or Cornell who, as part of her duties at LCDC, subjected Plaintiff, and others whom she represents, to pre-arraignment strip and/or visual body cavity searches without having, and recording in writing, a reasonable suspicion that such searches would be productive of contraband or weapons. Defendants LCDC Corrections Officers Does 1 - 50 are, or were, natural persons whose identities are not known who were employed as corrections officers by CSI and/or Cornell at LCDC during the relevant time period. Upon arrival at LCDC, and prior to any appearance before a judge and without there being any reasonable suspicion that she was concealing contraband, Plaintiff, pursuant to policies, practices, and procedures of Defendants, and each of them, was subjected to a strip search and visual body cavity search in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and Article II, Section 10 of the Constitution of the State of New Mexico. Plaintiff does not know the identities of all of the class members. SECOND CAUSE OF ACTION (Claims Arising Under the New Mexico Tort Claims Act on behalf of Plaintiff and all persons similarly situated) 40. To the extent required, Plaintiff has given written notice of the claims contained herein in compliance with the New Mexico Tort Claims Act, § 41-4-16 NMSA 1978, as amended.\nWHEREFORE, Plaintiff prays for relief for herself and for all persons similarly situated, as hereunder appears.\nVII. Plaintiff, on behalf of herself and the members of the class, seeks a judgment declaring that Defendants’ strip search policies and procedures violate constitutional rights under the federal and New Mexico constitutions, declaring that Defendants must cease the activities described herein and enjoining Defendants from any further strip searches of prearraignment detainees without individualized reasonable suspicion.\n-22-\n\n\x0c54. Judicial preliminary approval is appropriate where a case settles as a class action before certification. ( Manual for Complex Litigation, 4th Ed., ¶ Defendants have agreed not to oppose this request.\nc. Both sides developed evidence to support their claims and defenses. Defendants believe they would have defeated class certification and, in any event, would have been permitted to defend claims on an individual basis. Most courts, in considering approval of a class action settlement, note the advantages of avoiding\n8\n\n\x0clengthy and expensive litigation. Co., 177 F.R.D. 54, 69 (D. Mass 1997) (approving settlement agreement and noting that settlement “provides class members with timely relief without having to risk the uncertainty of outcome, duration, and expense inherent in continuing the litigation”).\nFinally, the Stipulation of Settlement does not grant unduly preferential treatment to the Class Representative or segments of the class. Lopez v. City of Santa Fe, 206 F.R.D. 285, 288 (D.N.M. 2002) (certifying settlement class); Fed. 1977).\nThe first requirement, an absence of any conflict between the Class Representative and the Settlement Class, is satisfied because both the Class Representative and the SCMs allege they have been harmed by the Defendants’ allegedly unlawful practices. See, e.g., Senter v. Gen. Motors Corp., 532 F.2d 511, 525 (6th Cir. P. 23(b)(3); Wilfong v. Rent A Center, Inc., 2001 WL 1795093 (S.D. Ill. 2001) at *7-8. To satisfy the predominance requirements. The notice must be reasonably calculated to reach interested parties and where the names and addresses of the interested parties are known, due process requires mailed notices.

PC-SD-0001,"On March 7, 1980, inmates of the South Dakota State Penitentiary in Sioux Falls, South Dakota filed a class action in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the South Dakota Department of Corrections. The plaintiffs, represented by the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union and by East River Legal Services, asked the court for class certification and declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated by the conditions of their confinement. Specifically, they complained of fire hazards, unsanitary food, work safety hazards, poor ventilation, inadequate plumbing, inadequate medical care, inadequate dental care, inadequate psychological care, overcrowding, lack of hot water, lack of heat in winter, inadequate law library, lack of recreation and exercise, and inadequate grievance procedures.

On May 31, 1984, the district court (Judge Donald J. Porter) granted declaratory and injunctive relief to the plaintiffs, ordering the defendants stop double-celling inmates and to file a plan to fix the other problems within 120 days. Cody v. Hilliard, 599 F.Supp. 1025 (D.S.D. 1984). The defendants appealed. On October 28, 1986, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Judge Gerald W. Heaney) affirmed the district court's decision. Cody v. Hilliard, 799 F.2d 447 (8th Cir. 1986).  

The defendants asked the Eighth Circuit for a rehearing en banc, and on October 28, 1986, the Eighth Circuit agreed to rehear the case. Cody v. Hilliard, 804 F.2d 440 (8th Cir. 1986). On October 6, 1987, the en banc Eighth Circuit (Judge Pasco Middleton Bowman II) reversed the district court's order forbidding double-celling, declaring that the practice was not unconstitutional, but affirmed all other orders of the district court. Cody v. Hilliard, 830 F.2d 912 (8th Cir. 1987). The plaintiffs appealed. On February 29, 1988, the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the appeal. Cody v. Hilliard, 485 U.S. 906 (1988).

On July 8, 1985, the district court (Judge Porter) issued a consent decree in the case, addressing issues such as prison environmental concerns, fire safety, medical care, psychological care, prisoners' access to courts, and food preparation and sanitation.  In the years that followed, the defendants paid attorneys' fees to the plaintiffs on multiple occasions, never disputing the plaintiffs' entitlement to fees.  

On April 16, 1996, the defendants asked the district court to terminate the consent decree, arguing that they were in substantial compliance. On March 13, 1997, the district court (Judge Richard H. Battey) dissolved the consent decree and vacated all supplemental orders. The plaintiffs appealed. On March 27, 1998, the Eighth Circuit (Judge John R. Gibson) reversed the decision to dissolve the decree and remanded the case back to the district court, holding that the dissolution of the decree was not supported by sufficient findings or an articulation of basis for the decision. Cody v. Hilliard, 139 F.3d 1197 (8th Cir. 1998). 

On February 17, 2000, the district court (Judge Lawrence L. Piersol) approved a private settlement agreement between the parties and dismissed the case without prejudice. Cody v. Hilliard, 88 F.Supp.2d 1049 (D.S.D. 2000). According to Jude Piersol’s opinion, the settlement agreement contained more specific language and guidelines than the 1985 consent decree and established procedures for continued monitoring of prison conditions. The defendants agreed to monthly self-inspections for fire safety and yearly OSHA-type inspections of all shop areas. The settlement agreement provided more relief with regards to the tuberculosis isolation provision, quality control provision, and specific shop provisions.

The plaintiffs asked the district court to award them attorneys' fees.  On November 15, 2000, the district court (Judge Piersol) awarded $106,877.74 in attorneys' fees to the plaintiffs. The defendants appealed. On September 11, 2002, the Eighth Circuit (Judge Gibson) affirmed the fee award. Cody v. Hilliard, 304 F.3d 767 (8th Cir. 2002). The case is now closed.","['UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF SOUTH DAKOTA SOUTHERN DIVISION\n\nFILED\nMAR 1 3 1997\n\nWILLIAM R. CODY, individually and on ) behalf of all other persons similarly situated,\nPlaintiff,\nvs.\nCAROLE HILLARD, President of the Board of Charities and Corrections; FRANK BROST, Vice President; TED SPAULDING, Member; D.A. GELLHOFF, Member; LYLE SWENSON, Member; JAMES SMITH, Executive Secretary; HERMAN SOLEM, Warden of the South Dakota State Penitentiary; sued individually and in their official capacities,\nDefendants.\n\nCIV. Mr. Amundson complained about poor ventilation, particularly when floor stripper and pepper spray were being used because the ventilation did not remove the fumes. He participates in monthly meetings as part of the quality improvement program. Mr. Heim testified that, as a result of the proposed Settlement Agreement, hazard communication training has been implemented in the wheelchair shop and many hazardous chemicals have been eliminated. Dr. Powitz, who has also been involved in the case since the beginning, has 1058 inspected the *1058 penitentiary on numerous occasions to monitor conditions and to evaluate compliance with the Consent Decree. In contrast, in any new litigation affecting the class, relief ordered by a court would not be subject to termination for two years. Pursuant to the agreement, plans are in process for yearly OSHA-type inspections of all shop areas by the South Dakota Office of Risk Management.\n\n\x0cImportantly, as demonstrated by the monthly fire self-inspections, some provisions of the proposed Settlement Agreement go beyond the 1985 Consent Decree and call for improvements not covered by the Decree. Dr. Powitz testified that the provision of the Settlement Agreement calling for yearly OSHA-type inspections by an industrial hygienist selected by the South Dakota Office of Risk Management will address most of the valid shop safety objections that were raised by prisoners, including ventilation, training, and protective equipment issues.\nMany prisoners filed objections citing specific circumstances in which they felt the medical care received by them or someone they knew was inadequate. The Defendants shall either provide proper plugs for sinks in individual cell halls; or 3. The Defendants shall provide necessary medical, surgical and dental care; 2. Superintendent DeLano\'s memorandum and the related notice to the inmates are attached hereto as Exhibits C and D.\nFinally, as to legal access by illiterate inmates, it is a standard operating procedure that all inmates are verbally advised during orientation of the method of obtaining legal services. This individual will conduct frequent inspections and prepare the necessary reports for action by the warden or his representative.\nCell Ventilation and Heating The ventilation system and its operations were reviewed. Therefore, it was decided that a horizontally mounted bar-type handle be mounted on both sides of the door where it does not interfere with the normal operation of the elevator.

Cody and Roger Flittie, individually and as class representatives, appeal from the district court\'s order dissolving the consent decree in this South Dakota prison reform litigation. P. 60(b) to dissolve the consent decree and supplemental orders. 498 U.S. 237,247 (1991) (if district court finds that defendant operating in compliance with Constitution and unlikely to return to ""its former ways,"" purposes of injunction have been achieved).\nThe plaintiffs contend that the district court clearly erred in ignoring thenevidence that there were past and present violations of the consent decree. He toured the SDSP, focusing particularly on environmental health concerns raised by the plaintiffs, for approximately two days in December, 1983.\n\nIn addition to expert testimony, the court had the benefit of sworn testimony from several corrections officers at the SDSP, including the Warden, other staff and also inmates. No running hot water is available to inmates in cells in Federal Hall. The SDSP kitchen is equipped with a batch pasteurizer to purify milk. Also one or two protective custody inmates work in the protective custody area as runners or clean-up men.\ne. It is inappropriate for inmate dental workers under these circumstances to be involved in scheduling other inmates for dental services.\nf. The records are not placed in an inmate\'s medical file in any particular order. It is not possible under present circumstances for the psychiatrist to conduct long-term psychotherapy on individual inmates experiencing nonemergency mental problems, i.e., inmates having a difficult time adjusting to the prison environment.\nc. At present, the counseling staff at the SDSP does not have time to adequately perform psychotherapy or psychological treatment on inmates.\n2. Under the consent decree entered into by the parties in Crowe v. Erickson, supra, this court ordered that: ""The state will provide periodic workshops to train selected inmates in the fundamentals of legal research."" Inmates at the SDSP are denied meaningful access to the courts if they must *1046 depend upon inmate workers who are inadequately trained in the fundamentals of legal research to assist them in legal matters.\n\n\x0ch. 1276 at 1282, 1293 (W.D.Mo.1980) (constitutionally inadequate ventilation system); Palmigiano v. Garrahy, 443 F.Supp. at 962-63, 979-80, 987; Laaman v. Helgemoe, 437 F.Supp. at 921, 926, the court held that inadequate ventilation in the furniture shop and in the paint spray booths at an Indiana prison, along with the use by inmates of toxic glues without adequate ventilation, respirators or gloves, contributed to a finding of cruel and unusual punishment under the totality-of-conditions test.\nThe court concludes that the findings of fact with respect to environmental conditions in the SDSP shops and vocational programs demonstrate serious deficiencies presenting health hazards to inmates employed in these areas.\n5. A careful review of the totality of conditions of confinement present in Rhodes, as compared with the totality of conditions existing at the SDSP leads this court to distinguish Rhodes on its facts.\nThe Ohio prison scrutinized in Rhodes was described by the district court as ""unquestionably a top-flight, firstclass facility."" Inmates of Allegheny County Jail v. Pierce, 612 F.2d 754, 763 (3d Cir.1979); Bowring v. Godwin, 551 F.2d 44, 47 (4th Cir.1977).\nThe court\'s findings establish the strong demand for qualified psychiatric and psychological treatment of inmates at the SDSP. Lyon v. Farrier, 730 F.2d 525, 527 (8th Cir.1984). Accordingly, there is no evidentiary basis for a conclusion that double-celling has caused an increase in such incidents, and we note that the District Court did not make a finding on this question of fact.\nThe Court\'s opinion also is notable for those portions of the District Court opinion that it does not mention. The Appellants are continuing to maintain the kitchen elevator in safe operating condition and have installed safety buffer devices on the doors to prevent injuries.\n\n2. Appropriate safety devices continue to be maintained on machinery in the vocational shops. A request has been made to the Argus Leader to further search its files and provide copies of any other articles concerning inmate release. Finally, the third phase is work done after the remand to negotiate and secure approval of the private settlement agreement. Alternately, the district court could have reasonably interpreted the letter as evidence that the parties did not intend the settlement to resolve the disputed issue of fees one way or the other 0907 which would still permit the class to seek fees.\nThe State also points to a letter of May 14, 1997, shortly after the district court\'s termination order, in which class counsel told the State that ""we will delay our action on plaintiffs\' attorneys\' fees claim until the court of appeals has acted.""",0.6097,0.2517,0.3563,0.1788,0.0737,0.1044,0.2451,0.1012,0.1432
JI-NM-0003,"On May 16, 2006  a juvenile detainee filed a class action civil rights suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico, challenging the strip search policy of the Dona Ana County Juvenile Detention Center.  Plaintiff alleged that the County and officials in charge of Juvenile Detention Center had a blanket policy of strip searching all pre-arraignment detainees upon their arrival at the Juvenile Detention Center, regardless of the offense charged, or whether there was any suspicion that the detainee possessed weapons or contraband.  The plaintiff, who was strip searched pursuant to this policy, alleged that that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.  The County and Detention Center officials generally denied the allegations.

Shortly after the suit was filed, the District Court (Judge Judith C. Herrera) stayed the proceedings at the request of the parties so that they could pursue settlement negotiations.  Plaintiff's attorney had filed a similar class action on behalf of adult detainees that were strip searched at the Dona Ana County.  See JC-NM-0004: Lira v. Dona Ana County.  Negotiations were conducted on both the adult and juvenile cases.  On November 21, 2007, Judge William Johnson consolidated both cases, designating Lira as the lead case.

Shortly after the consolidation, the parties filed an Amended Stipulation of Settlement, under which the Defendants agreed to pay $5.3 million to resolve all class claims.  The stipulated Adult Settlement Class included all detainees who were strip searched between March 7, 2003 and March 7, 2006 at the Dona Ana County Jail prior to arraignment.  The stipulated Juvenile Settlement class included all detainees who were strip searched between May 16, 2003 and May 16, 2006 at the Dona Ana Juvenile Detention Center.  It was estimated that there were approximately 11,000 class members.  Individual claims were to be paid per an agreed upon distribution formula, with the range of expected pay-outs per individual claimant was estimated at $1,200 to $2,400. Representative plaintiffs would receive a total $200,000 or $25,000 per class representative.  $1,666,667 of the settlement fund was allocated for attorneys' fees.

Judge Johnson preliminarily approved the settlement on December 20, 2007. 

On May 20, 2008, the district court (Judge Johnson) issued a final approval of the settlement and a final judgment of dismissal in the case.  In 2011, the parties filed a Joint Motion to allow disbursement of remaining funds to two non-profit entities.  Although most of the funds had been successfully distributed, about $22,000 remained for claimants the administrator could not reach.  The court granted the motion.

DR-CA-0054,"On January 15, 2015, the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center (CREEC), along with two individuals requiring wheelchairs for mobility, brought this class action against Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc., in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Ashford operated 15 hotels in California and others throughout the United States. In October 2014, the two plaintiffs had separately asked if the Courtyard Oakland Airport hotel and the Embassy Suites Walnut Creek hotel provided wheelchair-accessible shuttle services. Both locations informed the plaintiffs that they did not. The plaintiffs alleged that Ashford violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act by failing to provide wheelchair accessible vehicles at its hotels. The plaintiffs requested declaratory relief and a permanent injunction requiring Ashford to comply with state statutes and the ADA. The plaintiffs filed for class certification of individuals who rely on wheelchairs or scooters for mobility and have been or would be denied full and equal enjoyment of Ashford's services because of the lack of accessible transportation services at Ashford's hotels. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Donna M. Ryu. 

On March 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed to consolidate and/or relate this case to two other cases for pre-trial purposes, because the defendants were publicly traded real estate investment trusts that own and operate hotels in the U.S. and the plaintiff was similarly-situated and seeking class certification. The judge rejected the argument that these similarities warranted case consolidation, and denied this motion on May 6, 2015. 

On August 27, CREEC filed a stipulated dismissal of all claims, with prejudice, of one of the plaintiffs. In an amended complaint filed on August 31, that plaintiff was removed and a new one was added.

Meanwhile the court had granted the defendant's request for private alternative dispute resolution and the parties began settlement discussions before Magistrate Judge James Larson. These proceedings concluded with a settlement agreement reached on October 2, 2015. On November 5, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to certify the class and for preliminary approval of the settlement. The judge granted both motions on December 18, 2015. 

The Settlement Agreement required all Ashford-owned and operated hotels to come into compliance with ADA regulations by providing hotels that offer transportation services with equivalent transportation services for people who used wheelchairs or scooters. The Agreement explicitly required that Ashford provide accurate information to potential hotel guests so that no guests would be erroneously deterred. Ashford agreed to pay fees and costs of monitoring and the agreement authorized class counsel to seek an award of attorney's fees. 

The proposed Settlement Agreement was sent to hundreds of disability organizations as well as individuals who had communicated with CREEC about problems with Ashford's transportation. The plaintiffs sent class notice by email to 655 organizations and 43 individuals on December 21, 2015, and received no objections to the proposed settlement. 

On March 22, 2016, the court approved the final certification of the settlement class. In a final judgment on March 29, 2016, the Court approved the Settlement and announced that it would retain continuing jurisdiction over the parties, the lawsuit, and the settlement for purposes of enforcing the settlement and resolving disputes under the Settlement Agreement. The case was closed.","['Case4:15-cv-00216-DMR Document1 Filed01/15/15 Page1 of 10\n\n1 Timothy P. Fox – Cal.

IM-NY-0047,"This is a constitutional challenge to the federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), 1 U.S.C. § 7, as it applies to the immigration rights of lesbian and gay bi-national couples.  It was filed on April 2, 2012, by five such couples, each lawfully married in South Africa, Vermont, New York, or Connecticut, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.  Represented by Immigration Equality and private pro bono counsel, plaintiffs sued the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS -- a component agency of DHS), seeking to compel recognition of their same-sex marriages and non-discriminatory adjudication of marriage-based immigrant benefits. 

Under DOMA, marriage ""means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife."" 1 U.S.C. § 7.  In each of the plaintiff couples, one spouse is American and the other foreign; if the marriage were not same-sex, the American spouse could petition for an immigrant visa for the foreign spouse and place the foreign spouse on the path to lawful permanent residence and citizenship. However, following DOMA's direction, USCIS has denied plaintiffs those immigration benefits.  Plaintiffs argue that this denial is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, constituting discrimination on account of both sexual orientation and sex. 

The Obama administration has announced that in its view, DOMA is unconstitutional and has therefore declined to defend it in court (although the federal government continues to enforce the statute).  Accordingly, a ""Bipartizan Legal Advisory Group"" (BLAG) has been appointed by the (Republican) House of Representatives to appear in cases like this one and defend the constitutionality of DOMA.  BLAG filed papers in this case on May 31, 2012.  

On July 25, 2012, the district court (Judge Amon) stayed proceedings in the case--including immigration enforcement against any of the plaintiffs--pending the Second Circuit Court of Appeals decision in Windsor v. United States, No. 12 CV 2335 (2d Cir), a case already pending on appeal similarly challenging the constitutionality of DOMA.  (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12113"">PB-NY-0017</a> in the Clearinghouse.)  Since the government had declined to stay immigration enforcement, this was reported as a small victory by the plaintiffs.  

On July 8, 2013, following the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12113"">Windsor</a>, BLAG withdrew as intevenor-defendant. On August 26, 2013, after the Plaintiffs' notice of voluntary dismissal, the Court dismissed the case without prejudice.","['r 11 - 0\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COtttfcT""*\'1 ~£ kti £: "" ^ EASTERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK\n\nEDWIN BLESCH, TIMOTHY SMULIAN, FRANCES HERBERT, TAKAKO UEDA, SANTIAGO ORTIZ, PABLO GARCIA, KELLI RYAN, LUCY TRUMAN, HEATHER MORGAN and MARIA DEL MAR VERDUGO,\nPlaintiffs,\n\nCIVIL ACTION DOCKET NO.

Plaintiff Frances Herbert is a United States citizen. Plaintiff Heather Morgan is a United States citizen. She is married to Plaintiff Lucy Truman, a native of the United Kingdom. They live together in Sandy Hook, Connecticut. Defendant Janet Napolitano is currently the Secretary of Homeland Security. Defendant Alejandro Mayorkas is currently the Director of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services. He is sued in his official capacity.\n21. Edwin and Tim are a dedicated and loving couple. Tim had also believed he would not meet anyone with whom he would want to share his life. When he met Edwin, he knew his life had changed as well.\n29. When Edwin returned to the United States, he contacted Tim immediately and invited him to visit. Because Edwin\'s Medicare does not cover him in Canada, however, he was twice forced to return to the United States for necessary medical care. On March 29,2011, Edwin filed an 1-130 Petition for Alien Relative with USCIS on behalf of Tim, his legal spouse. Therefore, under the DOMA, your petition must be denied."" In 1999, Frances went to\' Japan to visit Takako, needing to see the woman she loved.\n41. In 2001, Takako was granted Fl student status, and she began nine years of college study. That following summer, in 1999, Mar came to visit Heather and her family in New Jersey for three weeks. For the first time, she and Heather were able to spend time together on a day-to-day basis while Heather worked and Mar studied. In October 2008, Heather returned to Madrid and to Mar. It was on this trip that Heather and Mar realized they were in love.\n55. In November 2008, anxious to see Heather, Mar came to New York and the two were able to spend time together as a couple for the first time. He has an associate\'s degree, a bachelor\'s degree and a master\'s degree and is currently in his second year at the Graduate Center of the City University of New York working toward his Ph.D. He volunteers teaching a Spanish GED class at Columbia University and volunteers with a number of arts programs targeting youth.\n63. They became enamored with each other immediately.\n64. Soon after meeting, Pablo accompanied Santiago to Puerto Rico to meet Santiago\'s family. He has given that up out of love for his spouse. Santiago, in return, has made the trip to Venezuela on Pablo\'s behalf, bringing Pablo\'s love and respect to his family from whom he is separated because of DOMA.\n67. They were legally married in Stamford, Connecticut on May 2, 2011.\n68. Because of DOMA, the Petition and Application are certain to be denied. During their time apart, Lucy visited Kelli often. With Lucy\'s frequent travels to the United States, she feared each time that she would not be allowed entry to be with her partner.\n76. In May 2009, Lucy came to the United States with a B1/B2 visitor visa. On March 27,2012, USCIS notified Kelli that her petition\n\nwas denied, stating: ""DOMA applies as a matter of federal law whether or not your\n\nmarriage is recognized under state law. They are married, with all of the promise that marriage brings. If the adjudicator ""determines that the facts stated in the petition\n\n18\n\n\x0care true and that the alien in behalf of whom the petition is made is an immediate relative,"" then the adjudicator ""shall.. . At the same time or after the citizen spouse files the Form 1-130 Petition, the foreign national spouse may file a Form 1-485 Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status in order to gain status as a lawful permanent resident of the United States. 8 U.S.C. § 1255(a); see also 8 C.F.R. § 245.1.\n86. Instead, DOMA costs the federal government billions of dollars. As a direct result of DOMA, USCIS treats legally married same-sex couples differently than legally married different-sex couples. Because DOMA, as applied by USCIS, requires this disparity of treatment with regard to the adjudication of Plaintiffs\' Petitions for Alien Relative and, ultimately, Applications for Lawful Permanent Residence Status for the foreign-national Plaintiffs, it creates a classification that singles out one class of valid marriages—those of same-sex couples—and subjects persons in those marriages to differential treatment compared to other similarly situated couples. Compel USCIS to reopen and re-adjudicate the 1-130 petition of Edwin Blesch on behalf of his spouse, Timothy Smulian, on the merits, without regard to sex or sexual orientation.\n23\n\n\x0c6.

PN-WI-0001,"Plaintiffs, ACLU national and the ACLU of Wisconsin, along with Covington & Burling attorneys, filed this class action alleging that the Milwaukee Police Department's (MPD) stop-and-frisk policies were unconstitutional. The case was filed in the Eastern District of Wisconsin on February 22, 2017. The complaint alleged under Section 1983 that Milwaukee's stop-and-frisk policies violated the Fourth Amendment's search and seizure protections as well as the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. It also alleged under Section 2000d that Milwaukee was in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorney's fees and costs. 

This case was brought as a class action on behalf of all persons who had been or would have been stopped by MPD officers after January 7th, 2008. More broadly, the complaint alleged that in 2008, when Milwaukee adopted a ""broken windows"" policy regarding crime prevention, MPD began engaging in high-volume, suspicion-less stops as well as stops illegally motivated by race and ethnicity. The complaint alleges a formal and informal quota system of stops that led to a threefold increase in stops from 2007 to 2015. Plaintiffs also defined a subclass of black and Latino individuals. All of the named plaintiffs in the class were black or Latino, and the complaint detailed specific allegations of suspicion-less stops for each of them as well as data indicating the impact that Milwaukee's stop-and-frisk policy had specifically on black and Latino communities.   

The parties were engaged in negotiations almost from the beginning - a Joint Interim Settlement Report was filed in September 2017, and minute orders show that the parties were engaged in mediation and later settlement negotiations throughout the fall of 2017 and into the spring and summer of 2018. A settlement was approved on July 23, 2018. The settlement covers a range of issues: changes to officer training; revisions to MPD policies and guidelines regarding reasonable suspicion and probable cause; body camera usage; data collection, coding, and publication; timely filing of reports after stops; supervision from within MPD for officers conducting stops; procedures for both external and internal complaints regarding stop-and-frisk; data auditing by MPD; hiring, counseling, retraining, and discipline; and community engagement. 

The District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement under Judge J. P. Stadtmueller. To achieve compliance with the agreement, MPD must incorporate all substantive parts of the agreement into policy, hire and train needed personnel, appropriate sufficient funds, and show sustained and continuing improvement on constitutional policing based on a variety of data-based factors. The settlement terminates after five years. The ACLU and an outside consultant (CJI) will act as monitors. The settlement indicates $1,900,000 in attorney's fees and costs, and Milwaukee is also responsible for paying for CJI's fees. 

<b>Current status</b>
MPD is required to provide data on variety of police and civilian interactions quarterly, and to make training and policy materials available for review. CJI is to file a report each year regarding MPD's compliance and their review of relevant data. If MPD is non-compliant, CJI can submit six-month updates on those issues, indicating whether they have been fixed. The case is ongoing: CJI filed an initial report in September of 2019, a six-month report indicating items on which MPD is non-compliant in April of 2020, and a second semi-annual report on Jun 5, 2020.

Plaintiff Charles Collins is a 67-year-old Black man, military veteran, and long-time Milwaukee resident. Mr. Collins previously worked as a Certified Nursing Assistant at the Milwaukee County Mental Health Complex and is currently retired. The City receives a substantial amount of federal financial assistance for law enforcement activities. Mr. Roberts, J.B., and another passenger, D.L., each asked one of the MPD officers to provide the reason for the traffic stop. Mr. Jansen again felt that he could not leave the scene without answering the question. The officer who had commented on Mr. Chambers’ car asked to see his driver’s license, which Mr. Chambers provided.\n107. Two MPD officers got out of the car and approached Mr. Chambers. Ms. Silvestre asked the officer why he was treating her this way.\n136. The next day, Ms. Silvestre called MPD’s District Six station to file a complaint. Defendant Flynn has acknowledged that a significant number of the stops conducted by MPD officers are of law-abiding individuals. that they wanted dots on a map to show that police work was being done. Referring to the “quota like mandate” announced at MPD’s March 2016 Compstat meeting, Crivello’s letter stated, in pertinent part: “Police officers were clearly directed that the norm, or average, was two traffic stops per day. This difference reflects the net impact of race because the analysis controlled for the various community and policing factors, as described above. Defendant FPC is aware of, and has effectively ratified and sanctioned, the MPD’s high-volume, suspicionless stop-and-frisk program, despite the fact that it knew or should have known—based in part on Defendant Flynn’s public statements, the 2011 MJS Report, the Crivello Letter, and the Hardy order, among other things—that this strategy resulted in the pervasive and routine violation of the constitutional and statutory rights of Milwaukee residents.\nH. The Defendants Fail to Properly Train and Supervise MPD Officers 215. The named Plaintiffs have a strong personal interest in the outcome of\nthis action, have no conflicts of interest with members of the Subclass, and will\nfairly and adequately protect the interests of the Subclass.\n247. The MPD’s practice of conducting suspicionless stops and frisks that are motivated by race and ethnicity has therefore become policy, practice, and custom with the force of law, and reflects deliberate indifference to\n73\nCase 2:17-cv-00234-JPS-DEJ Filed 02/22/17 Page 73 of 81 Document 1\n\n\x0cthe rights of the Plaintiffs and members of the Subclass under the Fourteenth Amendment.\n273. At one point, D.A. and E.W. asked if they could leave, but one of the MPD officers told them to wait so that the officers could verify their identity.\n70. Mr. Roberts explained that they were on their way home from the Summerfest concert and that there were no weapons or alcohol in the minivan.\n87. Mr. Brown contacted the court several times over the next two years to inquire about the citation. The officers permitted Mr. Olivar and L. to leave the scene without charging or citing them for any violation.\n2016 182. At around 2 p.m. one afternoon in the late winter or early spring of 2016, Mr. Olivar and L. were walking westward on West Lapham Boulevard on their way to a friend’s house when an MPD vehicle passed them and pulled over to the right side of the road in front of them. Consequently, there may be instances in which an officer has individualized, objective, and articulable reasonable suspicion when initiating the encounter, but subsequent developments establish that the subject of the encounter is not or has not engaged in criminal activity or a traffic or vehicle equipment offense.\n3. Two observers on behalf of Plaintiffs shall be allowed to observe any training related to this Agreement. An MPD supervisor who fails to properly supervise a subordinate officer to ensure that traffic stops, field interviews, no-action encounters, frisks, and searches comply with constitutional standards, are properly reported, and are sufficiently documented, including through the review of the subordinate officer’s electronic reports concerning these encounters, may be subject to a Personnel Investigation and any resulting counseling, retraining, and/or discipline, including the possibility of termination.\n7. Relentless attention to and discussion of data collection, as well as engaged supervisors—who provide coaching, ongoing training, and set expectations on the radio and the street—need to be the focus of the Department.\nVacant positions at MPD—patrol officers, detectives, and supervisors— impede the Department’s ability to achieve successful compliance at the same time as the MPD is struggling to maintain effective operations while engaged with the complexities of preparation necessary to host the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in July 2020. Our team members fielded questions from the Commissioners and Alderman Pérez about CJI’s work and areas where the City was showing progress at that time.\nThe Public Safety and Health Committee, a Common Council subcommittee, as part of an agenda item at their April 5, 2019 meeting, requested an update on the Settlement Agreement. CJI is now awaiting CERTT documentation confirming that all personnel have acknowledged this policy. CJI cannot test this capability remotely and has plans to test in person when on site at MPD in September 2019.\n\nSA Paragraph:\n\nIV.A.10\n\nSettlement Agreement Requirement:\n\nDefendants shall ensure that MPD provides, on a quarterly basis, the electronic, digitized data on all traffic stops, field interviews, no-action encounters, frisks, and searches described in paragraph IV.A.3, with the exception of any personally identifiable information, to the FPC, Plaintiffs\' counsel, and the Consultant. Throughout the course material and during group discussions, trainers and officers generated ideas on ways to maintain positive interactions with the public. 17 The Department leadership in the last several months requested that the City establish both promotional and hiring exams. Conversations about community policing, what that means to the Department, and how commanders and supervisors communicate that to the patrol officers should occur at the command staff meetings.\nThe accumulation of data over the next six months will make the audit function, as well as the analysis function, integral to operations. CJI expects details, including the release schedule, of this deliverable to be included in a six-month follow up report by CJI.\nAlso in the coming year, we will be reviewing the MPD performance review process to ensure that reviews include individual officer compliance with the legal and data collection requirements relating to stops and other encounters.\nIn accordance with the Settlement Agreement paragraph IV.C.6, MPD will prepare a community policing status report and submit the report to the FPC twice per year (in July and January). It is unclear what intention the City has or what action it has taken to update, charge, or amend the membership of the CCC.\n59\nCase 2:17-cv-00234-JPS Filed 09/23/19 Page 59 of 72 Document 143\n\n\x0cPROCEDURES FOR COMPLAINTS\nSummary of Requirements in Settlement Agreement\nThe Settlement Agreement includes requirements related to complaints concerning MPD conduct both from members of the public and from within the Department. MPD did not complete training on SOP 085 of all officers and supervisory personnel until June 18, 2019.\nIrrespective of the training schedule, as officers completed training, they were encouraged and expected to follow the articulated requirements for all citizen contacts that require documentation including field interviews, traffic stops, searches and seizures, and no-action encounters. Moving forward, now that the formal training is completed, the Audit Unit will be communicating in writing to the Academy any issues that are detected and deemed a department-wide retraining issue.\nFrom March to July 2019 the supervisory and cursory reviews focused on the counseling and re-training of officers and supervisors, not discipline. While MPD’s reasons for this change may represent the best course of action, the City was required in accordance with SA VIII.2 to consult with the Plaintiffs’ counsel and seek agreement before making amendments. As such, for the purpose of this six-month report, we find the Defendants to be in process on this requirement.\nUpdated Status: In process\nSA Paragraph IV.E.1.a-d\n“Defendant FPC shall audit data, dashboard camera footage, and body camera footage on traffic stops, field interviews, no-action encounters, frisks, and searches, every six (6) months to identify:\na. As described in our first annual report and mentioned above under our discussion of SA IV.E.1a-d (FPC audits), we continue to believe that the FPC does not currently have the capacity to meet the requirements of the Settlement Agreement.\nThe Defendants have also struggled with how to handle the existence of personally identifiable information (PII) related to private individuals and officers involved in traffic stops, field interviews, and no-action encounters.",0.7121,0.2342,0.3524,0.1587,0.0521,0.0785,0.2589,0.0852,0.1282
ID-CT-0002,"On February 8, 1990, the Connecticut Traumatic Brain Injury Association filed a class action lawsuit against the Connecticut Departments of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and various state hospitals in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.  Plaintiffs were a class of persons with intellectual disabilities or traumatic brain injuries and who were or may be placed in Norwich or Fairfield Hills Hospitals.  They were represented by Connecticut Legal Services, the Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy, and private attorneys.  The complaint alleged violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the practice of placing non-dangerous brain injured individuals and individuals with intellectual disabilities in state hospitals for the mentally ill, where necessary treatment and training was not available.    

The defendants moved to exclude those class members who were voluntarily placed into the hospitals and the District Court (Chief Judge Peter C. Dorsey) denied the motion on April 4, 1995.  Conn. Traumatic Brain Injury Assoc. v. Hogan, 161 F.R.D. 8 (D. Conn. 1995).    

Thereafter, the parties settled the claims of the class members with intellectual disabilities on the eve of trial.  Chief Judge Peter C. Dorsey entered a stipulation and order on August 2, 1995 which approved the settlement terms.  The defendants agreed to place half of the class members with intellectual disabilities into community settings by June 30, 1996 and the remaining by June 30, 1997.  The defendants also agreed to provide services to the class members in accord with the standards, policies, and procedures developed in the CARC v. Thorne (ID-CT-0001) litigation.  After those transfers, the Fairfield Hills Hospital and Norwich Hospital were to be closed, and the portion of the case relating to class members with intellectual disabilities was to be dismissed. 

The case continued with respect to claims of class members with brain injuries.  Note that the PACER docket did not contain hyper-links to case pleadings and orders and we did not have copies of subsequent case documents.  Information on the history of this litigation for the period of August 2, 1995 to November 2002 was limited to the PACER docket entries.

According to the PACER docket, following the partial settlement, the case proceeded to trial, beginning on July 25, 1995 and continuing through August 16, 1995.  It appears that the trial was then recessed and stayed by the court so that the parties could pursue settlement negotiations.  Negotiations continued and the parties participated in numerous court ordered settlement conferences with mediator, Attorney Cousins.  The remaining issues in the case did not settle.

Trial as to the claims of brain injured class members reconvened in February, 2001.  The docket indicates that following post-trial motions and briefs, the District Court entered judgment for the defendants and closed the case on November 26, 2002.  

","v. Hogan MR-CT-002-002\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nDISTRICT OF CONNECTICUT\n\nCONNECTICUT TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ASSOCIATION, INC., The case is\n\nalso brought on behalf of all persons with traumatic brain injury\n\nwho are or may be confined at Connecticut Valley Hospital (CVH).\n\nThis case asks the Court to enjoin the practice of placing and\n\nretaining non-dangerous retarded and/or brain injured persons in\n\nstate hospitals for the mentally ill where the treatment and\n\ntraining they need is unavailable. These\n\n\x0cpractices violate the plaintiffs\' rights secured by the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Rehabilitation Act I of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §794 and the ADA, 20 U.S.C. § 12131 et seq. PARTIES; THE CONNECTICUT TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY ASSOCIATION. For eight years CTBIA and its local support groups have conducted programs for brain injured persons and have acted as advocates for them. Burton became handicapped in 1975 when he sustained a traumatic brain injury in an automobile accident. On October 1, 1987, the Newtown Probate Court involuntarily committed plaintiff to Fairfield Hills Hospital, not because of mental illness, dangerousness or need for psychotherapy, but because Burton is brain-damaged, non-ambulatory and the state has developed no appropriate residential settings for him and similarly situated persons.\n23. The plaintiff, Ronald Rotman, is a forty-five year old\nresident of the Kettle Building, Norwich Hospital, Norwich, Connecticut. Further, he has been routinely restrained, has regressed and lives in an unsafe environment.\n29. On November 4, 1988, and on several prior occasions, the Norwich Probate Court, the Honorable Linda Salafia presiding, involuntarily~committed the plaintiff to Norwich Hospital, not because he suffers from mental illness,, or because he is dangerous, but because there was nowhere for him in the mental retardation system.\n30. Norwich Hospital has recognized since at least 1982 that Ronald should be transferred to an appropriately staffed and supervised community residential setting. He has lived at Norwich Hospital since June 7, 1984.\n10\n\n\x0c32. David needs rehabilitation including physical therapy, behavior modification and communication therapy to prevent further\n11\n\n\x0cregression, chemical and physical restraint and injury. None of these therapies and programs are available at Norwich Hospital. She is mentally retarded and not mentally ill. Diane Chapman is a forty-four year-old resident of\nNorwich Hospital. She remains at Norwich Hospital on a ""voluntary"" status even though she is not capable of making an informed choice regarding her treatment or placement at Norwich Hospital.\n45. None of these needed programs are available at Norwich Hospital.\n46. As a result, Diane has been subjected to chemical restraint, has been stigmatized as a mentally ill person, has regressed and is not safe. Following hospitalization he was transferred to a nursing home and then was taken home to live with his family. in a group home operated by DATAHR in Danbury, Connecticut. He was committed to Fairfield Hills Hospital some six months later after DATAHR determined that they were unable to meet his needs.\n56. Immediately after admission the treatment team informed the family that Robert was brain injured and not mentally ill and did not belong at Fairfield Hills Hospital.\n57. From 1981 through July, 1988, Timothy was admitted to\n\nNorwich Hospital on approximately eight occasions due to behaviors 18\n\n\x0cthat the family could not manage at home. Defendant, Garrell S. Mullaney, is the Superintendent of Norwich Hospital. Defendant, Honorable Linda Salafia, is the Judge of the Norwich Probate Court. As a result, she has been forced to commit brain injured and retarded people to Fairfield Hills Hospital simply because there is no other placement for them.\n76. Moreover, plaintiffs personal clothing is routinely lost, and plaintiffs are frequently required to wear improperly fitting clothes and underclothes, and sometimes even go entirely without necessary items of clothing. Individual habilitation programs for each classmember living at Fairfield Hills, Connecticut Valley and Norwich Hospitals are not provided.\n85. These classmembers are placed at risk of harm and/ or returning to psychiatric hospitals by reason of the DMH defendants\' failure to address needs associated with their brain injuries in the community placement process.\n99.

DR-UT-0001,"On May 8, 2006, twelve deaf Utah State University students filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, against Utah State and its  Board of Regents. The case was brought under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, with the Plaintiffs alleging that the Defendants had discriminated against them in many ways, including: denying them access to the full benefit of the University's programs, services, and activities; failing to provide for effective communication through the use of auxiliary aids and services; failing or refusing to provide timely accommodations; utilizing discriminatory policies, practices and procedures that tend to screen out students who are deaf; and failing to meet the ADA's mandate to provide services in the most integrated setting.  The students were represented by private counsel.

Factual allegations included: that the University failed to provide accommodations for the use of American Sign Language, by providing unqualified or under-qualified interpreters -- the University allegedly justified this by claiming that it could not find qualified interpreters, but declined to hire such qualified interpreters when students presented them the opportunity; that the University's program for providing notes to deaf students was inadequate to the point that notes were often provided to students only long after the tests or exams for which they were relevant had already occurred; that students were sometimes required to attend classes where no interpreters were provided; that in some such classes the University's proposed solution was to have students make audio recordings of classes and them have them transcribed later, forcing students to sit through classes they could not understand or participate in, and then review transcripts during their free time. There were further examples of similar alleged violations. 

The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment an injunction requiring Utah State to adopt written policies and training programs to correct the alleged violations and to require them to provide appropriate auxiliary aids, services, and accommodations. The plaintiffs also sought attorneys' fees and damages for financial loss and emotional distress.

On April 17, 2007, the parties entered a Stipulation and Joint Motion for Voluntary Dismissal with Prejudice, requesting the court dismiss the case, which it did the following day. The parties had reached a settlement, the terms of which were not included in the Court record.  According to news reports, the school promised to employ one full-time staff interpreter for every two deaf students who needed those services, with the interpreters to be available to students to interpret during classes, on-campus meetings and on-campus extracurricular activities.  Transcript service and note-taking services would continue, and if students felt they were behind they could receive tutoring.  ","lUMBER: 1: 06CV00057 JTG\n\n~- SMITH, an individual; EMMALEE\n\nSPARROW, an individual; and, JON\n\nHELGESEN, an individual, for themselves and\n\nrepresenting other who are similarly situated,\n\nPlaintiffs,\n\n~s.\n\nlt. Plaintiff, BRANDON DOPF, is a natural person who resides in Logan, Utah. Brent is a person who is Deaf and his primary means of communication is American Sign Language.\n14. Callista is a person who is Deaf and her primary means of communication is American Sign Language.\n4\n\n\x0cCase 1:06-cv-00057-DB Document 1 Filed 05/08/06 Page 5 of 63\n15. Any time Gary complained to the Disability Resource Center (""DRC"") about USU\'s inappropriate and/or inadequate services Diane Baum Director of the DRC, or another administrator, told him that there was a shortage of qualified interpreters in Logan and that USU was doing all it could afford to do.\n31. In 2004, Kelli became so frustrated with the lack of appropriate services that she wrote a letter to Kermit Hall, President ofUSU at that time, and demanded that he either find a remedy the lack of services or refund a portion of the tuition to students who are Deaf to compensate them for the substandard services the Defendants offer.\n43. Both the extension program and independent study require Kelli to take courses in a manner that segregates her from her peers, including hearing students pursuing the same major. To avoid this embarrassment John is often forced to withhold comment. The lack of appropriate aids and services denies him the ability to participate in classroom discussions.\n53. Each time the administrators assure him that he will be provided with appropriate accommodations; time and again he is not.\n54. John simply wants his right to participate in a discussion, raise his hand and ask a question like any other student. Christina is a junior majoring in Theatre Education. However, because the Defendants have failed or refused to support or provide the use of qualified interpreters,\n14\n\n\x0cCase 1:06-cv-00057-DB Document 1 Filed 05/08/06 Page 15 of 63\nChristina is forced to sit on the outside and wait, while her hearing classmates have moved ahead in their educational goals.\n57. Christina was forced to attend this class without the opportunity to participate or understand the class. Christina is afraid to take any more class from Theatre department. Christina felt that she had no choice but to continue with the Astronomy class. Ellen is a 20-year-old woman who is Deaf and who uses American Sign Language as her primary means of communication. Ellen recently been provided with temporary interpreters through an outside agency. While attending USU Brent took Theatre, Calculus 1, two computer classes, and English. Due to the lack of interpreters Brent felt he could not understand, could not participate, and generally couldn\'t do much anything in class. However, Brent\'s frustration grew as he sat in class without understanding the material, until he could do nothing more than retreat to his bathroom and cry. Often these interpreters were not replaced with any comparable service. Defendant USU told James that he would have no interpreter, or any other aid, for his computer class; he was very upset. James was thrilled, until he found out that the Defendants had not hired more interpreters, they had simply pulled the interpreters from the classes of other Plaintiffs. James knows that he must compete with the other Plaintiffs if he wishes to have an interpreter for his courses. Defendant USU told Jon that he could have a transcriber for his English class. Jon struggled, again without an effective means to ask questions or get clarification. Defendants\' failure or refusal to support and/or provide qualified interpreters, note takers and other appropriate auxiliary aids causes substantial affront and indignity, which injury is ongoing until the underlying practices, policies, and procedures are corrected by a change in policy and practice, injunction, or the source of the affront is removed. Defendant BOARD knows or should know that the programs and services it governs at USU are not operating in compliance with the ADA and Section 504, but it fails or refuses to require compliance, fund positions or programs to bring USU into compliance and has voted down on or more proposals that would support, allow or improve access for Plaintiffs and the members of the class to educational opportunities in equity with students who are not Deaf.\n115. In its regulations, the ADA requires public entities to take the steps necessary to ensure that communications with applicants, participants, and members of the public with disabilities are as effective as communications with others. 28 C.F.R. § 35.160 (b)(2); see also DOJ\'s Technical Assistance Manual,§ 11-7.1100.\n119. Defendant BOARD has consistently failed or refused to require Defendant to comply with the ADA and other federal laws, and/or has failed or refused to support or fund programs to effectuate such compliance.\n122. Furthermore, Defendants have had actual knowledge for 5 to 7 years that the ADA and Section 504 required them to provide appropriate aids and services for\n33\n\n\x0cCase 1:06-cv-00057-DB Document 1 Filed 05/08/06 Page 34 of 63\nstudents. Defendant USU has established a policy or practice of removing or transferring interpreters from one Plaintiffto another after the start of the academic session and replacing the interpreter with inappropriate accommodations, such as a note taker, or failing or refusing to replace the accommodation in any manner. Plaintiffs also experience limitations of their freedom, and other forms of intangible injuries to their dignity interests.\n134. On information and belief, since 1999 many USU students who are Deaf have individually and collectively filed similar complaints with Defendants.\n154. In his letter President Hall states that he is aware that USU lacks of appropriate services for its students who are Deaf and has been aware of the issue for two or more years. Each of the discriminatory conditions identified above presents a palpable and substantial deprivation of a degree of Plaintiffs\' much-cherished independence. Plaintiffs have incurred added costs for their education because they are Deaf including the cost of retaking some classes, hiring tutors, lost employment opportunities, the cost incident to transferring to another college or university and others for which they should be compensated. Plaintiffs have been forced to engage the services of an attorney. Each of the\n45\n\n\x0cCase 1:06-cv-00057-DB Document 1 Filed 05/08/06 Page 46 of 63\ndiscriminatory conditions identified above presents a palpable and substantial deprivation of a degree of the Plaintiffs\' much-cherished independence. The acts or omissions of Defendants (or their agents) caused and continue to cause the Plaintiffs to suffer irreparable harm in the nature of humiliation, limitation of freedom, and other forms of intangible injuries to their dignity interests. Plaintiffs repeat and reallege each and every allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 204 hereof, and incorporate the same herein by reference 206. The Plaintiffs have been forced to engage the services of an attorney. Defendants fail or refuse to administer their services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting.\n222. The injuries sustained by Plaintiffs relating to the Defendants\' discrimination are ongoing until the discriminatory conditions are corrected.\n224. Furthermore, the Plaintiffs and other members of the class are injured and suffer from severe emotional distress (much more than typical persons could be expected to endure) they are entitled to compensation for such injuries.\n225. That this Court issue such other relief as may be just, equitable and appropriate, including compensatory damages for the actual and prospective financial losses as well as emotional distress suffered by the Plaintiffs because of the discriminatory actions of the Defendants and a award the Plaintiffs reasonable attorneys\' fees, litigation expenses and costs. On the Plaintiffs\' Fifth Cause of Action:\na.

MH-ID-0003,"On August 29, 2014 Ada County and the Ada County Coroner filed a complaint in the Fourth Judicial District of Idaho. They sued Disability Rights Idaho (“DRI”) under Idaho Code § 10-1201 et seq., (Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act), and Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 57. At the request of the defendant, Disability Rights Idaho, Inc. (DRI), the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Idaho on September 8, 2014. On September 18, 2014 DRI filed a counterclaim under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. DRI sought injunctive and declaratory relief to challenge the refusal of the Coroner to provide timely access to the records sought. Ada County filed a motion to remand the case, but the motion was denied by Judge Edward J. Lodge on April 29, 2015. 2015 WL 1944003.

Disability Rights Idaho (DRI) is a non-profit corporation that has been designated by Idaho to protect and advocate on behalf of people with mental illness, as defined in the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et. seq. (“PAIMI”). (PAIMI is a federal mandate that gives authority to investigate complaints of abuse, neglect, due process and rights violations in public and private facilities that provide overnight mental health treatment.) The dispute arose when the Ada County Coroner refused to provide its investigatory records relating to a suicide death of an individual, who had been residing in an inpatient behavioral health unit of an Ada County hospital. The Coroner denied DRI’s request for non-public records and initiated this declaratory judgment action in State court in response to DRI’s letter that stated they would initiate a federal lawsuit if necessary.  DRI submitted an answer to the Coroner’s complaint and a counterclaim. 

On June 15, 2015 both parties submitted Motions for Summary Judgment. In addition, DRI submitted a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Ada County Coroner argued that regardless of PAIMI, DRI did not have the right to access the Coroner’s records of its death investigation, because the Coroner was not an “agency” as defined by PAIMI. The Coroner had also cited federal and state privacy concerns and questioned DRI’s probable cause to investigate the death. On July 20, 2015, the Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest stating that federal law was clear that P&A’s had broad access to investigatory records relating to mental health treatment facilities. The DOJ also stated that the Coroner’s office was an “agency charged with investigating,” as stated in PAIMI, because it was a division of the Ada County government that was responsible for investigating deaths.

On March 7, 2016, Judge Edward J. Lodge entered a judgment in favor of DRI. The court held that the Coroner was an “agency charged with investigating” reports of incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury under PAIMI and that the Coroner needed to release the records to DRI. 168 F.Supp.3d 1282. The case is now closed.","[""Case 1:14-cv-00369-EJL Document 40 Filed 07/20/15 Page 1 of 23\nCYNTHIA COE, D.C.

Nor can the Coroner second-guess the P&A’s determination that there is probable cause to investigate – federal law reserves that determination to the P&A. P&As have a crucial role in investigating neglect and abuse in mental health facilities, and coroners charged with investigating such tragic incidents cannot block P&A access to investigatory records.\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES The United States submits this Statement of Interest pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 517 (1966),1 because this litigation involves the proper interpretation and application of federal law. Supplementing the authority to access facilities is the right of P&As to access records of an individual with mental illness from either the facility itself or an “agency charged with investigating reports of incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury occurring at such [a] facility.” 42 U.S.C. § 10806 (b)(3)(A); 42 C.F.R. §51.41 (1997).\n2 See, e.g., Statement of Interest of the United States, Ala. Disabilities Advocacy Program v. SafetyNet Youthcare, 13-0519-CG-B, (S.D. Ala. Oct. 14, 2014); Statement of Interest of the United States, Disability Rights Miss. v. Miss.

PAIMI obligates a P&A to maintain records\nin a confidential manner:\nAn eligible [P&A] system which, pursuant to section 10805 (a)(4) of this title, has access to records which, under Federal or State law, are required to be maintained in a confidential manner by a provider of mental health services, shall, except as provided in subsection (b) of this section, maintain the confidentiality of such records to the same extent as is required of the provider of such services. PAIMI does not allow the P&A to disseminate the records publicly and instead specifically requires that they be maintained in confidence. The P&A does not confiscate the coroner’s records, make them unavailable to the criminal justice system, or in any way interfere with the coroner’s ability to do her job. Access means only that, and nothing precludes an Idaho coroner’s office from continuing to fulfill its statutory duties while also complying with PAIMI.\nFinally, the Coroner argues that allowing Disability Rights to access its investigatory files would impact the work of coroners across Idaho. at 15.\nThat is all the more reason that this Court should be clear and firm in its decision granting records access to Disability Rights. Ada County and the Coroner counter the Coroner is not an “agency” as used in the definition of “records” under PAIMI, and that DRI is accordingly not entitled to the Coroner’s records.\nSTANDARD OF REVIEW\nThe Court should grant summary judgment if there are no genuine issues of material fact and the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law. v.

While defendants urge us to follow the district court and find that this addresses only ‘patient records,’ and not ‘hospital records,’ and peer review and quality assurance records are not ‘patient records’ because they do not ‘belong’ to the patient, we agree\nMEMORANDUM DECISION AND ORDER- 16\n\n\n\x0cCase 1:14-cv-00369-EJL Document 42 Filed 03/07/16 Page 17 of 32\nwith the Third Circuit’s observation that ‘of’ in this context need not be read so narrowly.

However, that the Coroner lacks such information does not place an affirmative duty on DRI to determine whether D.T. has family members or representatives before it can access D.T.’s records. 42 U.S.C. § 10805(a)(1)(a); § 10801(b)(2)(B).\nFederal cases are clear that the P&A is the final arbiter of probable cause, and that an entity may not second-guess the P&A’s probable cause determination in order to withhold records.

Failure to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted. Although the complaint asserts in paragraph 8 that providing DRI with the records in question would “violate the state and federal privacy rights of D.T., D.T.’s family, and any individual who interacted with D.T.” nevertheless the complaint fails to assert that either the Ada County Coroner or Ada County would suffer any legal jeopardy or legal liability whatsoever due to the release of coroner’s records to DRI, nor does the complaint assert that there are any legal obligations or duties between the parties that are in danger of being violated in the absence of declaratory relief. Furthermore, the complaint fails to assert a causal connection between any alleged injury to either Ada County or the Ada County Coroner that is fairly traceable to DRI, and not the result of the independent action of third parties not before the Court.\n16. The findings and purposes of the United States Congress, in passing PAIMI, 42 U.S.C. §10801 et seq., On June 25, 2014, the Ada County Coroner responded to DRI’s request for records by letter. On July 7, 2014, DRI wrote to the Ada County Coroner in response to the Coroner’s letter dated June 25, 2014. A true and correct copy of that letter, with appropriate privacy redactions, is attached to this counterclaim as Exhibit “C” and is incorporated herein by reference. In the letter DRI stated that it did not wish to interfere with any ongoing investigation of the Ada County Coroner related to the death of D.T. and requested that the Coroner inform DRI when the investigation was complete.\n40. On July 21 and 23, 2014, DRI wrote letters to the legal counsel for the Ada County Coroner. DRI hereby re-alleges and reasserts paragraphs 18 through 45, above, as if fully set forth herein. Due to the Ada County Coroner’s violations of PAIMI, DRI is entitled to declaratory and injunctive relief, attorney fees and costs, and other relief, as set forth in the Prayer for Relief below.\nCOUNT TWO Claim for Relief Under 42 U.S.C. §1983 58.

CJ-TX-0007,"On December 5, 2005, a convicted murderer on parole in Texas filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000 and 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Texas Department of Criminal Justice and the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole. The plaintiff is represented by both public and private counsel. The plaintiff asked the court for a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages. The plaintiff asked the court to permanently enjoin the defendants from: imposing the sex-offender label on him without a hearing that met due process requirements; subjecting the plaintiff to conditions that were different than similar supervisees; and failing to accommodate his religious exercise. The plaintiff also alleged that he has not had the same opportunities as other supervisees to acquire a job, obtain a driver's license, or receive education. 

On June 25 2007, Judge Lee Yeakel dismissed the plaintiff's claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000. The plaintiff's claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 were allowed to proceed. The decision allowing the claims to proceed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 was appealed. On June 23, 2008, the US Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, affirmed the decision of the district court.

On March 24, 2009, Judge Lee Yeakel ordered that the defendants must afford the plaintiff due process of law, and dismissed, without prejudice, all of his other claims. This judgment was appealed. 

On May 20, 2010, The United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, ruled mostly for the plaintiff, slightly modifying the amount of due process that the plaintiff must be afforded. 

On March 30, 2011, the district court (Judge Lee Yeakel) granted the plaintiff's motion for the enforcement of the March 24, 2009 judgment as confirmed by the court of appeals, and ordered that the determination of whether the plaintiff should be considered a sex offender should conform with the plaintiff's due process rights.  On August 24, 2011, the district court (Judge Lee Yeakel) denied the plaintiff's second motion for enforcement of the judgment, ruling that the defendant's actions after the March 30, 2011 order had sufficiently complied with the March 24, 2009 judgment.

The plaintiff's original sentence for murder ended in 2012. He will remain under mandatory supervision for possessing a weapon in prison in 1989 until 2016.

On September 20, 2013, the court granted a stipulation of dismissal for the Texas Department of Pardons and Parole, and dismissed the claim with prejudice. It appears that the plaintiff settled with the Texas Department of Pardons and Parole.

On December 12, 2013, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as moot since they did not have the ability to grant the relief that the plaintiff was asking for. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice stated that only the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole had this power, and they had been dismissed from the complaint.

On March 13, 2014, the plaintiff filed a fifth amended complaint based on the defendant's motion to dismiss for mootness. On July 29, 2014, the plaintiff filed a sixth amended complaint alleging that the plaintiff was unable to move into suitable housing and denied employment due to the defendant's actions. Not much activity appears on the docket thereafter. On Jan. 20, 2015, the parties filed a stipulation to dismiss the case. The court issued its final judgment the next day, granting the motion.

The case is now closed.","A-05-CA-1008-LY\n\nFINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW\n\nBE IT REMEMBERED that on November 10,2008, the Court called the above-styled cause for bench trial, which after several re~esses, concluded December 9, 2008. Mike Lozito, Parole Division Region IV Director, testified that one parolee in San Antonio has such a condition. Accordingly, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1391, venue is proper for this Court.\nPARTIES 8. In all the actions described herein, Defendant parole officers, Defendant Collier and Defendant Livingston (""TDCJ Defendants"") each were acting under color of law and pursuant to legal authority. Defendants have also told Mr. Meza that, should he find a job, an armed parole officer will have to go to the job site with him every day. Potential employers have told Mr. Meza they cannot hire him for this reason. The sex offender conditions remain imposed on Mr. Meza\'s parole.\n30. Before Mr. Meza can interview for a job, employment opportunities must be screened by Defendant parole officers to ensure that potential employment locations meet the conditions of his mandatory supervision. Armed guards do not accompany other Teee parolees to job interviews.\n22. Mr. Meza has not been allowed to attend computer orientation classes, job search classes and resume writing classes offered to other parolees at TCCC. Mr. Meza\'s attorneys contacted TDCJ regarding this abuse of due process, and were ignored. 19); Defendant\n\nCollier\'s Motion to Dismiss and Motion for Rule 7(a) Reply filed June 27,2006 (Doc. # Accordingly, the Magistrate Judge held that because Meza\' s success on his claims would not necessitate a finding that his mandatory supervision or its duration is invalid, Meza\'s claims are cognizable under Section 1983 and are not barred by Heck.\nIn their objections to the Magistrate Judge\'s Report and Recommendation, Livingston and Collier cite Coleman v. Dretke, in which the court of appeals granted a prisoner\'s habeas corpus petition challenging the revocation ofhis release on mandatory supervision. As the director of the Parole Division, Collier has personally overseen all decisions regarding Mr. Meza\'s parole. Mr. Meza alleges a cause of action because TDCJ and the Board do not allow Mr. Meza to attend worship services in the community, like other parolees, and did not allow him the opportunity to attend his cousin\'s funeral. Having considered the motions, the supplemental briefing, the case file, the oral arguments ofcounsel, and the applicable law, the Court will deny Livingston and Collier\'s motion to quash or for protective order in part and grant in part, and will grant Meza\'s motion to compel Orion to produce the subpoenaed documents in part by ordering Orion to produce the documents for in camera inspection.\nOn December 6, 2006, counsel for Meza served Orion Treatment Center (""Orion"") with a subpoena commanding Orion to produce and permit inspection and copying of Meza\'s complete patient file. In Geiger v. Jowers, 404 F.3d 371, 375 (5th Cir. See 28 U.S.C. § 636(b)(1)(C); Thomas v. Arn, 474 U.S. 140, 150-53, 106 S. Ct. Pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Mr. Meza claims that policy and custom of the Travis\n\nCounty Correctional Complex\'s (TCCC) Del Valle facility, described herein, resulted in\n\nviolations ofhis Fourteenth Amendment due process rights.\n\n\x0cCase 1:05-cv-01008-LY Document 311 Filed 10/30/08 Page 2 of 10\n4. If Mr. Meza were able to obtain employment, he would then have the resources necessary to develop a ""residence plan"" to live outside the jail, like other mandatory supervision releasees.\n24. The Parole Division, at Collier\'s direction, intentionally refuses to provide Mr. Meza with a parole officer to accompany him so that he may leave the jaiL This creates a de facto qualitative restriction on Mr. Meza\'s liberty, which has been imposed without due process oflaw.\n38. All of these conditions were imposed on Meza.\n\nThese sex offender conditions were imposed on Meza by the Board because Meza allegedly sexually assaulted the nine-year-old girl he murdered in 1982. It is unclear from the record how the Board obtained evidence that Meza sexually assaulted his victim in 1982, but it is undisputed that Meza was never convicted of a sexual offense.\n\n*2 Because of the sex offender and other conditions attached to Meza’s mandatory supervision, Meza has been unable to leave TCCC since his release from prison in 2002, despite the fact that the conditions of his mandatory supervision only required that he remain at TCCC for 180 days. Neither the parolee nor any attorney he retains is allowed to see the packet. The parolee may not appeal the Board’s decision.\n\n9\n\nAt oral argument, the defendants stated that the initial\n\nrecommendation that sex offender conditions should be imposed on an individual’s parole or mandatory supervision is made by the parole officer. We noted, however, that the State was “not precluded from further efforts to add these same conditions to [the defendant’s] parole upon proper notice....” Id. at 225.\nBased on Coleman I, it is clear that Meza had a liberty interest in being free from being required to register as a sex offender and participate in sex offender therapy. Coleman II, 409 F.3d at 668 (quoting Vitek, 445 U.S. at 492). Critically, the parolee has no opportunity to correct errors in the packet provided to the Board. Neither the parolee nor his attorney may even see the completed evidentiary packet on which the Board bases its decision of whether to require the parolee to register as a sex offender and attend sex offender therapy. Proceedings would\n\ninevitably be longer and tend to\n\nunmanageability. This exceeded the process allowed the inmate seeking discretionary parole in Greenholtz, the inmate facing the loss of good-time credits in Wolff, and even the parolee facing possible parole revocation in Morrissey.\n*12 Four of the Justices were persuaded that the inmate in Vitek had a right to counsel. Thus, revoking a prisoner’s good-time credits and imposing sex offender conditions on parole both have the effect of inhibiting a liberty interest to which the inmate or parolee is entitled.\n*14 If Meza were an inmate instead of a parolee, the Wolff standard would likely apply. Meza can claim at least the same process of an inmate, but as a parolee, he should generally be entitled to more favorable treatment than inmates. Austin v.

PN-MI-0002,"On March 11, 2004, the City of Detroit removed a state court lawsuit to the United States Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The lawsuit was filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of Detroit and Wayne County, as well as the Detroit Psychiatric Institute.  The plaintiff's estate, represented by the Innocence Project, asked the Court for compensatory and punitive damages, claiming that the defendants violated his First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the The Rehabilitation Act and also claimed violations of the state constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff's estate claimed that the plaintiff's wrongful conviction was the product of malicious police tactics that coerced a false confession from a mentally ill and hospitalized man.

In 1984, a 16-year-old girl named Michelle Jackson was found dead in a warehouse in Detroit. She had been sodomized and killed.  Her death was part of a string of 47 rapes and disappearances between September 1983 and 1984. The plaintiff, a man declared legally mentally incompetent, had a habit of calling the police and offering  to help them solve rapes and murders.  When the police approached the plaintiff in 1984, officers convinced him that his confession would lure the real killer out into the open.  The plaintiff confessed under this delusional belief, was convicted, sentenced to life in prison. He remained in prison for 17 years. 

The plaintiff's appellate attorney, Robert Slameka, refused to communicate with the plaintiff.  When the plaintiff filed a grievance against Mr. Slameka, he responded that the plaintiff's ""claim of my wrongdoing is frivolous, just as his existence. Both should be terminated.""  The plaintiff was exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. 

The plaintiff filed this action alleging that the detectives concealed evidence in bad faith, that his trial and appellate attorneys were ineffective, and that the result was false imprisonment in violation of the Constitution. He also alleged that the Detroit Psychiatric Institute cooperated with the police in prolonging his hospitalization and coercing his confession.

The plaintiff died while the lawsuit was pending, in 2005. The plaintiff's estate filed an Amended Complaint on May 10, 2005.

On May 5, 2006, the parties settled the case. The Court (Judge Gerald Rosen) entered a Consent Judgment. The Consent Judgment required the City of Detroit to pay the plaintiff's estate 3.25 million dollars.  In addition, there was a side agreement, provided as an exhibit to the Consent Judgment, under which the City agreed to make a good-faith effort to implement video recording by January 1, 2007, and to to submit bi-monthly reports on its progress to the Plaintiff's estate.

A Satisfaction of Judgment was entered on July 10, 2007, and the case was closed. We have no further information about the City's compliance with the Consent Judgment.","04-70922 HON: Gerald E. Rosen Magistrate Judge Pepe\n\nDefendants, __________________________\n\nPLAINTIFFS’ AMENDED COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY NOW COME the Plaintiffs, Ruth Harlin, in her representative capacity for the Estate of Eddie Joe Lloyd, and Tia Terese Glenn, by and through their attorneys, Cochran, Neufeld & Scheck, LLP, and Robinson & Associates, and say: 1. The jury and judge were deceived, by these police officers and the grossly inadequate defense provided to Mr. Lloyd at his trial, into sending an innocent man to prison for life. This is a case also about gross, inexcusable, and systemic indifference to a minimally competent and functioning criminal justice system. Mr. Lloyd was imprisoned for seventeen years, three months and twenty-four days for a murder and rape that he did not commit. Feeding Mr. Lloyd details of the crime and eliciting his “confession” based on Mr. Lloyd’s delusional beliefs was all the more egregious, because at the time of his “confession,” Mr. Lloyd was hospitalized after having been legally adjudicated mentally ill and a person requiring treatment under MCLA 330.1401 and 1472(a). On September 22, 2004, he died wrongfully of medical complications incurred during his 17 long years of wrongful incarceration. Defendant Thomas DeGalan was at all time material to this complaint, a police officer employed by defendant City of Detroit. Defendant William Rice is and was at all times material to this complaint, a police officer employed by defendant City of Detroit. He is named in his individual capacity.\n16. He is named in his individual capacity.\n23. Miss Jackson\n7\n\n\x0c2:04-cv-70922-GER-SDP Doc # 69 Filed 05/10/05 Pg 8 of 49 Pg ID 700\nhad been raped and strangled to death. She was left partially nude in an abandoned building after she was abducted early in the morning on January 24, 1984. Between September 1983 and February 1984, approximately 47 girls on their way to school were raped in the Detroit area. The other leg of her long underwear was wrapped around her neck. 11\n\n\x0c2:04-cv-70922-GER-SDP Doc # 69 Filed 05/10/05 Pg 12 of 49 Pg ID 704\n49. Upon information and belief, Officer DeGalan also had numerous phone contacts with Mr. Lloyd, none of which was taped. Many specific details that the police knew from their investigation, then fed to Mr. Lloyd, and then coerced, tricked, and deceived him into adopting were found in his “confession,” such as: a. The perpetrator abducted Miss Jackson on January 24, 1985 at about 7:00 a.m. b. The perpetrator abducted Miss Jackson while she was waiting for her school bus. e. The perpetrator left Miss Jackson in a single-door garage. f. Close to the garage there was a street light attached to a telephone pole. Mr. Lloyd’s knowledge of the material facts of the crime contained in his “confession” were fabricated by Officer DeGalan, who was questioning Mr. Lloyd. After this October 26 interview, Officer DeGalan again requested that Dr. Han, and/or Ms. Bacon of Detroit Psychiatric Institute keep Mr. Lloyd in their custody until Officer DeGalan could obtain a warrant for his arrest.\n66. Although the lab results obtained by the defendants did not conclusively establish or exclude Mr. Lloyd as the perpetrator of this crime, no further testing was conducted or\n16\n\n\x0c2:04-cv-70922-GER-SDP Doc # 69 Filed 05/10/05 Pg 17 of 49 Pg ID 709\nrequested by Mr. Lloyd’s counsel to determine if Mr. Lloyd was in fact the perpetrator of the crime. Prior to that time, Officer DeGalan contacted Mr. Lloyd’s parole officer and asked the officer to have Mr. Lloyd charged with violating his parole. The purpose of this hearing was to determine if there was probable cause to hold Mr. Lloyd for trial.\n80. She never met with Mr. Lloyd, and conducted no meaningful investigation. Mr. Lusby claimed he had fallen sick, and did not show up to court that day. In fact, Mr. Lloyd filed a Request for Investigation with the State of Michigan Attorney Grievance Commission complaining that Mr. Slameka had not contacted him nor kept him apprised of his appeal.\n97. As the Executive Chief Judge, this person is responsible for setting the rates paid to attorneys representing indigent criminal defendants during trial and appeal. After representing an indigent criminal defendant, the attorney is paid by the Wayne County Board of Commissioners, in accordance with the rate set by the Executive Chief Judge.\n122. Defendants knew or acted with reckless disregard to the fact that due to his psychiatric condition, and defendants’ manipulation and coercion, Mr. Lloyd was not aware of this material exculpatory evidence and therefore could not have discovered it through diligence unless otherwise disclosed to the prosecution or his defense attorneys. Defendants, including Officer DeGalan coerced, tricked and deceived Mr. Lloyd into\nadopting the facts that he had been given into a confession by taking advantage of Mr. Lloyd’s psychiatric condition, including his delusional belief that he was in partnership with the police and that by confessing he was helping them smoke out the real killer. No warrant would have issued for the arrest of Mr. Lloyd if defendants had not falsified the affidavit, or if they had included the material information about their own misconduct and Mr. Lloyd’s lack of knowledge of the crime. Based upon the fabricated probable cause, defendants held Mr. Lloyd for a crime he did not commit, and caused the prosecution to continue against him for murder. The City of Detroit discriminated against Mr. Lloyd by failing to accommodate his mental disability when it failed to regulate, train, and otherwise supervise its employees to properly accommodate the disabilities of mentally ill witnesses and suspects in conducting interrogations and other law enforcement activities.\n186. Although both Dr. Han and defendant Bacon knew of Mr. Lloyd’s delusional condition and of his historical and grandiose attempts to help the police solve high profile crimes that had occurred in the City of Detroit, knew he was medicated and involuntary committed, they failed to protect him from or monitor his contact with the police defendants. Han and Bacon also kept Mr. Lloyd committed without justification at the behest of the police defendants after any legal or medical justification for his continued confinement ended.\n36\n\n\x0c2:04-cv-70922-GER-SDP Doc # 69 Filed 05/10/05 Pg 37 of 49 Pg ID 729\n188. These policies, customs, and practices led Detroit police officers to believe that misconduct would be tolerated and that allegations of abuse of constitutional rights would not be investigated. This pattern made it foreseeable that officers would violate people\'s constitutional rights, in precisely the manner Mr. Lloyd’s rights were violated, and the City, through its final policymakers, was deliberately indifferent to this risk.\n203.

ID-VA-0002,"On May 4, 1990, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division announced, in a letter to the Governor of Virginia, its intent to launch an investigation, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq., into conditions at the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC), an institution for individuals with developmental disabilities in Fairfax, Virginia.  Five experts from the Department of Justice toured the facility, reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed NVTC staff, and audited reporting and investigation practices.  

On April 9, 1991, the Department of Justice announced its findings.  The Department of Justice reported that the health and safety of people living at NVTC was at risk for a number of reasons.  NVTC employed too few people and inadequately trained those it did employ, which placed residents in danger of unnecessary chemical and physical restraint.  Often mechanical restraints were accompanied by seclusion, which was a fire hazard.  Individualized programming for residents was inadequate and recordkeeping deficiencies made it impossible to monitor an individual's progress.  In addition, NVTC's medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medication and side effect monitoring we all inadequate.  In addition, NVTC provided insufficient medical care, including medication monitoring and occupational therapy.  Recordkeeping made it difficult to track the efficacy of individualized programming and medical care.  In closing, the Department of Justice expressed the desire to negotiate a resolution.

Negotiations did not make enough progress and, on May 31, 1994, the Department of Justice threatened to file a CRIPA lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of conditions at NVTC.  In addition to its earlier concerns, the Department of Justice chronicled systematic abuse and neglect at NVTC.  For instance, individualized training programs were so inadequate that individuals became seriously sick or died as the result of aggressive, pica, and other self-injurious behaviors.  One resident asphyxiated on a rubber glove, while another ate a reported seven cigarettes and one feminine hygiene pad in the span of two days.  Similarly, inappropriate feeding techniques and poor nutrition endangered residents' health. 

Virginia may have made an effort engage in productive negotiations, but the Department of Justice was not satisfied.  On February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice notified the Governor of Virginia that, in addition to being unconstitutional, the conditions at NVTC violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794, the Social Security Act (""Medicaid""), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq., and Virginia law.

On March 4, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a CRIPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, challenging conditions at NVTC.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to address (1) individualized programming, (2) undue physical restraint and isolation, (3) facility safety, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) medication monitoring, especially for tardive dyskenesia, and (7) staff numbers and training.  

On May 21, 1996, the court (Judge Leonie M. Brinkema) refused to consolidate this lawsuit with United States v. Virginia, No. 96-284, MH-VA-0002, an action challenging the constitutionality of conditions at a Virginia psychiatric hospital.  On May 21, 1996, the court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed its ruling to allow for settlement.  On July 18, 1996, the court approved a settlement agreement.

The settlement agreement itself was mostly concerned with procedural elements, such as development of a plan for improvement, compliance deadlines, evaluation, and dismissal.  The NVTC plan describes the required compliance.  The plan emphasizes the importance of trained staff in the provision of developmental disability services.  The plan stated detailed training requirements for direct care staff and incorporated training into almost every solution.  For instance, the plan mandated the dismissal of employees who neglected or abused residents.  Similarly, the plan sought to reduce the need for restraints by both improving staff development and requiring the interdisciplinary treatment teams' advance approval for the type of restraints to be used for each individual.  Thus, both chemical restraints and draconian physical restraint techniques, such as papoose boards, were eliminated.  Similar clauses addressed medical care, medication administration and tracking, physical and occupational therapy, abuse and injury reporting and investigations, recordkeeping, functional planning, community placement, and quality assurance.  

The parties modified the settlement on May 30, 1997.  On August 29, 1997, the Department of Justice inspected NVTC and found it was in compliance with the plan.  On June 3, 1998, the court dismissed the lawsuit.

On May 11, 2020, the Texas State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Texas Alliance for Retired Americans, and six individuals filed this lawsuit against the Texas Secretary of State, challenging the constitutionality of the laws restricting vote by mail. The plaintiffs brought this lawsuit as a declaratory action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, and as an injunctive action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the current vote by mail system was in violation of the plaintiffs' First, Fourteenth, and Twenty-Fourth Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the requirement that voters pay for the postage to return their early voting ballots by mail, the postmark requirements for the ballots, the requirement that voters must submit two handwriting samples that “match” in order to have their early voting ballots counted, and the criminalization of a person assisting a voter in returning a marked mail ballot denied the plaintiffs equal protection and procedural due process, and violated the prohibition on poll tax. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the defendants to provide prepaid postage on the ballot carrier envelopes used to return the marked mail-in ballots to the counties and enjoining them from rejecting vote-by-mail ballots if those ballots were postmarked by 7:00 p.m. on election day and received by the county election administrator before it canvased the election and from implementing, enforcing, or giving any effect to the Voter Assistance Ban. They further sought to enjoin the defendants from rejecting mail-in ballots on signature verification grounds, and sought an injunction requiring the defendants to provide voters the opportunity to cure any issues with signature verification before their ballots are rejected. This lawsuit was filed at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, and assigned to Judge Orlando L. Garcia. The plaintiffs were represented by private attorneys. 
 
The defendants moved to dismiss the case on June 3, arguing that the sovereign immunity bars plaintiffs’ claims, that the plaintiffs lack standing and that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim. 
 
The case is ongoing. 
","['Case 5:20-cv-00577-OLG Document 1 Filed 05/11/20 Page 1 of 43\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS\nSAN ANTONIO DIVISION\n\nLINDA JANN LEWIS, MADISON LEE, ELLEN SWEETS, BENNY ALEXANDER, GEORGE MORGAN, VOTO LATINO, TEXAS STATE CONFERENCE OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE, and TEXAS ALLIANCE FOR RETIRED AMERICANS,\nPlaintiffs,\nvs.\nRUTH HUGHS, in her official capacity as Texas Secretary of State,\nDefendant.\n\nCivil Action No. Ms. Lewis also suffers from a disability called kerataconus that affects her vision. Plaintiff MADISON LEE is a 23-year-old citizen and resident of and registered voter in Austin, Texas. Ms. Sweets would like to ask a friend or acquaintance to pick up her marked, sealed mail-in ballot and deliver it to the county for her; however, she knows that the Voter Assistance Ban criminalizes this and she is unwilling to put others at risk of prosecution. And, after more than a year on the waitlist, Mr. Morgan was recently notified that he would receive Meals on Wheels, though he did not receive his first scheduled meal deliveries likely of an inability of volunteers to do deliveries during the pandemic.\n18. it will actually lead to an increase and spread. For the poll workers who are willing to staff polling places on Election Day, and the few locations that open their doors to the public for this purpose, county election officials anticipate struggling to provide sufficient sanitary supplies and protective equipment to keep voters and election workers safe during in-person voting. The severity of the burdens imposed by the Postage Tax are significantly exacerbated under the present circumstances, when many Texans are suffering from the devastating economic impact of COVID-19, and it requires voters who do not have ready access to postage to subject themselves to public health risks in order to visit a post office or return their ballots in-person.\n69. In the 2016 general election, 48% of the test group of voters returned their absentee ballots via USPS. This all means that, as the USPS attempts to deliver an unprecedented number of vote-by-mail ballots across the country—both from county elections officials to voters, and then back again—the system will be under increasing pressure, causing increased delays and, ultimately, an increase in the number of ballots that are not timely returned before the Ballot Receipt Deadline and are thus not counted.\n84. Indeed, the Secretary advises county election administrators that they need not count these ballots until six days after election day at the earliest. See Ex parte Young, 209 U.S. 123, 157 (1908); City of Austin v. Paxton, 943 F.3d 993, 1001–02 (5th Cir. 2014) (a proper defendant has both “the particular duty to enforce the statute in question and a demonstrated willingness to exercise that duty”).\nThe Secretary does not implement the four aspects of Texas law that Plaintiffs challenge. 5:11-cv-315, 2014 WL 252024, at *3 (W.D. Tex. 1994), much less that members “alone finance [their] activities, including the costs of this lawsuit,” Hunt, 432 U.S. at 344.3 Even if Voto Latino has members, it lacks associational standing because it has not “identif[ied] members who have suffered the requisite harm” to establish injuries in fact. Union v. United States, 101 F.3d 1423, 1430 (D.C. Cir. The challenged statutes do not regulate Organizational Plaintiffs. See Coon v. Ledbetter, 780 F.2d 1158, 1160 (5th Cir. the Court’s ‘prudential’ principle that the plaintiff may not assert the rights of third parties,” but it omits the “exceptions” that occasionally overrode the prudential doctrine. Moreover, Plaintiffs’ Anderson-Burdick claim rests on Plaintiffs’ mistaken impression that “Texas has no meaningful need for its” ballot-receipt deadline because mail-in ballots “will be put in a box to be counted five days later at the earliest.” Also, mail-in ballots can be counted well before Plaintiffs suggest. Id. The statute does not suggest anything about delivery times, but even if it did, it would be immaterial.

And finally, the Alliance has diverted resources from its voter registration, phone banking, and get out the vote activities to education on how to avoid the pitfalls that the Restrictions impose. Thus, because the Vote By Mail Restrictions will cause the Organizational Plaintiffs to divert resources away from their normal programs to combat the effects of the Restrictions, they have standing to challenge them.10\nUnable to explain away the long line of similar cases conferring standing on similar organizations in similar voting rights cases, the Secretary largely bases her theory of organizational standing on a D.C. Circuit decision which found that a labor union lacked standing to challenge the constitutionality of the Line Item Veto Act. The comparison the Secretary tries to draw is inapt. So too here.11\n11 As relevant here, the Secretary’s description of her statutory authority ignores portions of the Texas Election Code that empower her to “take appropriate action to protect the voting rights of the citizens of this state from abuse by the authorities administering the states[’] electoral processes,” and “order” local officials to “correct offending conduct” when performing official functions “in a manner that impedes the free exercise of a citizen’s voting rights.” Anderson-Burdick claim (all four Vote By Mail Restrictions) The Secretary’s argument that Plaintiffs have not sufficiently alleged an undue burden on the right to vote misunderstands the law and ignores the ample facts plead in Plaintiffs’ Complaint. See, e.g., Soltysik v. Padilla, 910 F.3d 438, 447 (9th Cir. Under the grave circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic—which\n22\n\n\x0cCase 5:20-cv-00577-OLG Document 19 Filed 06/17/20 Page 25 of 31\nthe Secretary does not acknowledge in her 27 pages of briefing—her suggestion that voting by mail is simply a luxury or convenience is out of touch with reality, and the law.\nFinally, the Secretary’s insistence that the Vote By Mail Restrictions are lawful because some other states have similar restrictions is a red herring that violates Anderson-Burdick’s basic inquiry. how the Texas voters affected by these Restrictions are burdened⸺and is certainly insufficient to warrant dismissal at the pleading stage. M.L.B. v. S.L.J., 519 U.S. 102, 124 n.14 (1996) (quoting Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, 370 (1886)).

Plaintiffs Lack Standing....................................................................................................................2 III. The State cannot do so without encouraging voter fraud and undue influence.\nARGUMENT I. Sovereign Immunity Bars Plaintiffs’ Claims\nPlaintiffs acknowledge that the Secretary “does not personally” enforce the challenged laws, and they do not argue the Secretary’s employees do either. Instead, they suggest the Secretary has a state-law power to coerce local officials.

PB-MO-0001,"This is a class action filed in the Western District of Missouri, in which the plaintiffs are seeking to prevent the state from disenrolling recipients in Missouri's State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) who fail to meet their premium requirements without first notifying them of their right to appeal and to continue to receive program benefits pending the outcome of the appeal.  The defendants are the Missouri Department of Social Services, and the interim directors of the state Family Support Division and the state Division of Medical Services.  According to the named plaintiff, Julia M., Missouri terminated the benefits of her minor child, when, after a series of bank errors, the monthly premium was not deducted from Julia M.'s account in a timely fashion. Julie M. received the notice after the benefits already had been terminated. While the notice indicated a right to appeal, it did not indicate a right to continue benefits pending the outcome of the appeal or that the state had conducted any evaluation to determine eligibility for other benefits. 

On June 25, 2007, the District Court (Judge Nanette K. Laughrey) certified the class, defining it as ""[a]ll children residing in Missouri and who are receiving or who will receive [Missouri SCHIP] health coverage and are required to pay a premium under [state law]."" 

Judge Laughrey, however, did not immediately rule on the request of the representative plaintiff, identified as Julia M., to issue a preliminary injunction requiring the Missouri Department of Social Services to provide recipients with sufficient notice of disenrollment and continued benefits pending any appeal.

On February 2, 2008, the parties signed a Consent Decree in which the Defendants agreed to notify participants in SCHIP who have fallen behind in their payments. The notification must tell the participant that he/she has a right to appeal, and that during the appeals process he/she is entitled to continued benefits until the matter is resolved. Defendants also agreed to pay the plaintiffs over $165,000 in attorneys fees and expenses.   

The Court was to retain jurisdiction until October 15, 2008 in order to monitor the execution of the Consent Decree.

Actual Harm Necessitating a Preliminary Injunction\n56. Defendants\' policy and practice of disenrolling plaintiffs and plaintiff class members in the MC+ program without first detennining whether they are eligible for other medical assistance, including engaging in ex parte determinations, violates 42 § U.S.C. 1396(a)(8) and and its implementing regulation, 42 C.F.R. § 435.930(b).\nSEVENTH CLAIM FOR RELIEF 64.

Perhaps when the record is more fully developed, the state will be able to produce evidence that shows the missing August 3 letter did so apprise Julia M. of her rights to a hearing and to continued benefits pending its outcome, but that evidence is not presently before the Court.\nDefense counsel also admitted during oral argument that no ex parte review of J.W.M.’s eligibility for continued benefits under any other Medicaid program was performed prior to the termination of her benefits.

CJ-ID-0003,"On September 22, 2016, this complaint was filed under 42 U.S.C. §1983 on behalf of 104 unnamed sexual offenders, identified as John or Jane Does, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Idaho against the Idaho Attorney General, the Idaho Department of Corrections, and the Idaho State Police Force. The plaintiffs alleged that Idaho’s Sexual Offender Registration Notification and Community Right-to-Know Act was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process and the Ex Post Facto clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs also alleged that the Sex Offender Registry and accompanying statutes further violated the Substantive Due Process, Equal Protection, Double Jeopardy, Contracts, and Takings clauses of the U.S. and Idaho Constitutions. 

The plaintiffs were from across the country. Most were convicted of sexual offenses in 1980s and 1990s. One of their major complaints was that subsequent amendments to Idaho’s sex-offender registry laws amounted to unconstitutional retroactive punishment. For example, John Doe 100, of Bannock County, was convicted of a misdemeanor sexual offense in Montana in 1996. His offense did not require registration in Montana. He moved to Idaho in 2005 and was not required to register until 2007, 11 years after his conviction, when Idaho authorities reclassified his offense as a felony rather than the original misdemeanor. 

The plaintiffs sought a permanent order to stop the state and its counties from enforcing specific provisions of the Sex Offender Registry and accompanying statutes and laws. An amended complaint was filed on Apr. 26, 2017, which argued that the defendants further violated the plaintiffs' rights to: acquire, possess and protect property; seek and obtain safety and happiness; travel, life and liberty; and freedom of association and religion protected by the U.S. and Idaho Constitutions. The complaint argued that the Registry and accompanying laws were unconstitutional both facially and as-applied. 

The case was assigned to Judge David C. Nye on Aug. 2, 2017.

On Nov. 17, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. A hearing was held on March 6, 2018 before Judge Nye. On May 17, 2018, Judge Nye granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and granted the plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint to cure deficiencies identified. Specifically, the plaintiffs must identify actual harms suffered by one or more “Does” and present sufficient facts upon which the court can make a reasoned decision. 2018 WL 2275220.

On August 30, 2018, the plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint against the defendants. The defendants filed another motion to dismiss on October 18, 2018. A hearing was held on March 12, 2019. 

On April 5, 2019, Judge Nye granted the motion to dismiss again and dismissed the second amended complaint with prejudice. The court reasoned that the plaintiffs added facts with respect to twelve defendants in the second amended complaint but failed to tie such facts to specific constitutional violations and allege essential details that would allow the court to evaluate whether any of the allegations are plausible. The plaintiffs also ignored most of the arguments raised in the defendants’ motion to dismiss and failed to cite any binding authority to support their arguments. Accordingly, Judge Nye dismissed this case. 2019 WL 1508037.

On May 5, 2019, the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. As of January 20, 2020, this case is pending in the Court of Appeals.

His offense was not considered aggravated until July 1, 2009, fourteen (14) years after the conviction date. John Doe 19 is now required to register for life as an aggravated offender on the Idaho Sex Offender Registry.\n22. Plaintiff, John Doe 25, a resident of Butte County, State of Idaho, was convicted of a sexual offense in Twin Falls County, State of Idaho in 1990. He is not a recidivist, did not commit an aggravated offense, and is not classified as a violent sexual predator, therefore, John Doe 43 is eligible to petition to the Court to be removed from the Idaho Sex Offender Registry.\n46. John Doe 72 moved to the State of Idaho in 1998 and began registering on the Idaho Sex Offender Registry. John Doe 80 is now required to register for life as an aggravated offender on the Idaho Sex Offender Registry. He began registering as a sex offender in the State of California in 1993. His offense was not considered aggravated until July 1, 2001, a year after the conviction date. SORA 2001, 2009, 2011 classifications are based solely on the offense of conviction.\n146. It is a virtual impossibility for registrants to obtain employment dealing with the public.

A declaration that SORA 2001, 2009, 2011 violate, both facially and as applied by the Defendants, the double jeopardy clause of the United States Constitution (U.S. CONST., John Doe 3 was, and still is, foreclosed from ever being removed from the Idaho sex offender registry by reason of the July 1, 2009, amendment above stated.\nAMENDED COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND DECLARATORY RELIEF - 6\n\n\x0cCase 1:16-cv-00429-DCN Document 4 Filed 04/26/17 Page 7 of 145\n6. John Doe 7 was placed on probation for a period of ten (10) years. Plaintiff, John Doe 8, is a resident of Jerome County, State of Idaho. John Doe 8 was released from probation on March 24, 1997. Plaintiff, John Doe 21, is a resident of Twin Falls County, State of Idaho. At the time of his conviction, the Idaho Sex Offender Registry requirements had been enacted and John Doe 24 was then required to register as a sex offender. John Doe 28 was, and still is, foreclosed from ever being removed from the Idaho sex offender registry by reason of the July 1, 2009, amendment above stated.\n31. In January of 1996, John Doe 35 was convicted in Ada County, State of Idaho, of the crime of Lewd Conduct with a Minor Child Under the Age of Sixteen (16) Years, to wit: the age of fourteen (14) years, a felony. Under the then existing language of the Idaho sex offender registration requirements, John Doe 47 would later be eligible for release from the requirement to register as a sex offender. In 1996, John Doe 57 was advised by his probation officer of the requirement that he register as a sex offender in the State of California. Under the language of the Idaho sex offender registration requirements as they existed at the time of his release from custody/probation, John Doe 62 would later be eligible for release from the requirement to register as a sex offender. In 1995, John Doe 65 moved to the State of Idaho and began registering as a sex offender. John doe 70 was released in March, 2010, placed on probation for a period of three (3) years, and began registering in the State of Idaho as a sex offender. John Doe 84 is not a recidivist, did not commit an aggravated offense, and has not been classified as a violent sexual predator. Plaintiff, John Doe 97, is a resident of Ada County, state of Idaho. The ex post facto amendments to Idaho SORNA effective from and after July 1, 2009, expanded the definition of “aggravated offense” to include all registration offenses where the victim was less than thirteen (13) years of age, including the offense abovereferenced. John Doe 106 moved to Idaho in 2007 and began registering in the State of Idaho. John Doe 114 was contacted in 1993 and informed that he must register as a sex offender. Therefore, John Doe 122 should be eligible to petition the sentencing court to be removed from the Idaho Sex Offender Registry. Therefore, John Doe 126 should either not have been required to register as a sex offender in Idaho, or in the alternative, should be eligible to petition the sentencing court to be removed from the Idaho Sex Offender Registry.\n129. Idaho Code Section 18-8310 was amended to state that registration under this act is for life, however, any offender, other than a recidivist, an offender who has been convicted of an aggravated offense, or an offender designated as a violent sexual predator, could, after a period of ten (10) years from the date the offender was released from incarceration or placed on parole, supervised release or probation, whichever is greater, petition the district court for a show cause hearing to determine whether the offender should be exempted from the duty to register as a sexual offender. In 2012, amendments were made to Idaho Code Section 18-8304 removing subsection(4) which previously stated that when a defendant was convicted of rape under Idaho Code Section 18-6101(2), and at the time of the offense the defendant was nineteen (19) or twenty (20) years of age and not more than three (3) years older than the victim of the rape, the court could order that the defendant be exempt from the duty to register. What the legislature did in response to Smith vs. State of Idaho, and as a result\nof the 2009 amendment to Idaho SORNA, was to simply create a situation where the scarlet letters became indelible to all sex offenders, rather than provide the due process required by the Supreme Court.\nX. FIRST CAUSE OF ACTION Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution under 42\nU.S.C. § 1983 (Due Process) 233. Free exercise of religion violations under the First Amendment, “[b]ecause churches and other places of worship fall within the places certain sex offenders may not ‘knowingly be’ within five hundred (500) feet of under\n2 The parties utilize SORA, SORNA, “the Act”, “the registry”, and other similar iterations throughout the briefing to reference Title 18, Chapter 83 of the Idaho Code—Idaho’s Sexual Offender Registration Notification and Community Right-to-Know Act. United States v. Ritchie, 342 F.3d 903, 907 (9th Cir. The Court will then take up the\nremaining claims in numerical order.\nCLAIM 6 – EX POST FACTO\nEx Post Facto Clause violations under Article I, Section 9, Clause 3, because “[t]he effect and intent of [SORA] are punitive and impose new punishments, including but not limited to the affirmative disability of having to register in person every twelve (12) months, banishment from their families and communities, on offenders convicted before their enactment.” The Court will dismiss with leave to amend. Managers of both establishments indicated to Plaintiff that due to the fact that he was on the sex offender registry, they switched.\nIn January of 2018, John Doe 106 received a call from his distributer for the Spokane Market. John Doe 117 believes he has paid his debt to society (and lives in deep, persistent remorse) and has satisfied his sentence, but this ongoing hindrance feels to him like sustained punishment.\nJohn Doe 117 enjoyed traveling a great deal and prior to his conviction had taken several extended vacations and/or camping trips. He was later relieved from his job because either a customer or employee found out he was on the registry.\nIn 2013, John Doe 126 applied for a job and was denied the position because it was too close to a school.\nIn October of 2015, John Doe 126 applied for a job with the Sodexo Company in Moscow, Idaho. He has told each interviewer of his crime, and they said it didn’t matter at first, but once they received the background check, it had big bold letters across the top that said “CAUTION-REGISTERED SEX OFFENDER”.\nExamples include:\nLewiston RV 2011/2012: John Doe 116 was very qualified for the position of troubleshooting and repairing RV’s. This moved him from law enforcement notification only to law enforcement notification, only, to law enforcement notification plus public notification, in addition to other burdens.\nOn August 14, 1998, John Doe 134\'s attorney sent notice that the State of Nevada Community Notification Sex Offender Assessors Office added another law he did not plead to in order to raise his level of offense as outlined above. While in his current ward, he was released from his position as a Sunday school teacher due to complaints that as a registered sex offender, he should not be teaching Sunday school even though they were all adults.\nWhen he moved to where he is currently living, the bishop for the ward John Doe 132 was supposed to attend refused to even meet with him or give him his phone number.\nThe greatest harm resulting from having to register as a sex offender has been to John Doe 132\'s children. Conservation Force v. Salazar, 646 F.3d 1240, 1242 (9th Cir. ”).\nAfter considering the harms the Does allege, and evaluating the five Smith factors, the Court concludes SORA is not so punitive in effect or purpose that it negates the Idaho legislature’s intent to enact a civil regulatory scheme.",0.6408,0.2179,0.3252,0.1834,0.0623,0.093,0.2677,0.091,0.1358
IM-FL-0018,"On March 28, 1997, Nicaraguan aliens filed a class-action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, challenging the federal government's interpretation of the applicability of the ""stop-time"" rule for determining eligibility for suspension of deportation.

Prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996, which amended the Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien facing deportation could apply for ""suspension of deportation"" if he met certain statutory factors, which included that the alien had been ""physically present in the U.S. for a continuous period of not less than 10 years after becoming deportable or 7 years after applying for suspension of deportation.""  Time spent in deportation proceedings counted toward the physical-residence requirement.

The IIRIRA repealed the suspension-of-deportation provision of INA § 244 and replaced it a ""cancellation of removal"" provision.  To be eligible for cancellation of removal, the alien was required to meet certain time requirements of residing in the U.S.  The IIRIRA also contained a new ""stop-time"" provision, under which an alien's period of residence or continuous physical presence in the U.S. was deemed to end once the alien was served with a ""notice to appear"" for removal proceedings or committed a criminal offense described in INA § 244A(d)(1).  Shortly after the enactment of IIRIRA, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) held that the new ""stop-time"" rule applied to aliens who had applied for suspension of deportation prior to IIRIRA's enactment.  Plaintiffs challenged the BIA's application of the ""stop-time"" rule as violating the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment.

The District Court (Judge James Lawrence King) certified the case as a class action and issued a TRO order against enforcement of INS policy and against the deportation of class members during the pending action.  Tefel v. Reno, 972 F.Supp. 608 (S.D.Fla. 1997).  Following a hearing, the Court issued a class-wide preliminary injunction prohibiting the enforcement of the stop-time provision of the IIRIRA to pending applications for suspension of deportation.  Tefel v. Reno, 972 F.Supp. 623 (S.D.Fla. 1997).  The government's motion to dissolve the injunction was denied. Tefel v. Reno, 996 F.Supp. 1 (S.D.Fla. 1998).  The government appealed the District Court's orders.  

The United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit vacated the District Court's preliminary injunction and remanded the case for further proceedings. Tefel v. Reno, 180 F.3d 1286 (11th Cir.1999).  Rehearing en banc was denied.  Tefel v. Reno, 198 F.3d 265 (11th Cir. 1999).  Certiorari was also denied.  Tefel v. Reno, 530 U.S. 1228, 120 S.Ct. 2657, 147 L.Ed.2d 272 (2000).

Su, ~\' In re Air Crash Disaster at Sioux City, Iowa, 133 F.R.D. 515, 518 (N.D. Ill. 1990) (reaffirming the well-settled proposition that ""the party seeking the privilege has the burden of establishing all of its essential elements"").\n\nThe six documents at issue here are culled from a set of nine items addressed in the Magistrate Judge\'s written Order. 5 Plaintiffs have voluntarily dismissed all equal protection claims under Count II. ( On July I0, 1997, the Attorney General vacated the BIA\'s decision in Matter ofN-J-B. Moreover, subsequent to the entry ofthe preliminary injunction, Congress enacted, and the President signed into law theN icaraguan and Central American Relief Act (""NACARA""). On February I0, I998, the Court denied INS\'s motions. The Plaintiffs would be unable to develop a factual record before the IJ or BIA to support their estoppel claims.\n\n\x0cAbsent the existence of federal question jurisdiction in this Court to consider Plaintiffs\' estoppel and due process claims, judicial review is entirely foreclosed. The Court finds, based on the testimony presented by Plaintiffs at the May 13, 1997 hearing, the memoranda submitted by the parties, and counsel\'s legal argument to the Court, that each of these factors is satisfied and that the issuance of a TRO is mandated.\nFirst, the Court finds that there is a substantial likelihood that Plaintiffs will prevail on the merits of their challenge to the INS\' interpretation of § 309(c)(5). Landgraf v. USI Film Products, 511 U.S. 244, 268-69, 114 S.Ct. Section 240A(d)(1) provides that the right to seek cancellation of removal is cut off if within ten years of entry the person has been placed in a removal proceedings, i.e., ""served a notice to appear under section 239(a)"".

Review of the legislative 636 history of this Act, considered in light of the analysis of the *636 respective parties in their thoroughly written briefs in this case, brings one to the conclusion that Congress did not intend for § 309(c)(5) to be interpreted so broadly as to eliminate the right of aliens to apply for suspension of deportation where they played no role in delaying their cases.\nThe Court\'s interpretation of this statute is supported by the testimony of Mr. Peter Deutsch, a member of the United States House of Representatives from District 20 in the State of Florida. ""[39]\n\n\x0cThis policy was also reinforced by the Defendant BIA because it developed a far lower standard for reopening Nicaraguan cases than those of other nationals. The Defendants also circulated the notice to Interpreter Releases, a journal widely read by immigration lawyers throughout the United States.[42] They developed fact sheets to submit to the press and the public.[43] They developed a question-and-answer sheet for ""media guidance. Logan v. Zimmerman Brush Co., 455 U.S. 422, 102 S.Ct. Bridges v. Wixon, 326 U.S. 135, 152, 65 S.Ct. The Court has not found anything in the record, including in acting District Director Wallis\' deposition, that elucidates the point that INS apparently knew before the BIA ruled in N-J-B that the new, more restrictive physical presence requirement would apply retroactively, thus rendering ineligible for suspension tens of thousands of previously eligible class members.\nPlaintiffs assert that Defendants\' acts and conduct go beyond mere misrepresentation and reach the level of affirmative misconduct, citing Akbarin v. INS, 669 F.2d 839, 842 (1st Cir.1982). of May 13, 1997, at 161), that an equitable estoppel claim could not be raised before the Immigration Court in any form whatsoever.\nLastly, with respect to the legal theory of Defendants\' counsel that these claims should be presented in the first instance to the United States Court of Appeals, Plaintiffs rely upon Abedi-Tajrishi v. INS, 752 F.2d 441, 443 (9th Cir.1985), wherein this argument was rejected.

ED-CA-0027,"On January 25, 2018, SurvJustice, Equal Rights Advocates, and Victim Rights Law Center filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. These three nonprofit organizations sued the U.S. Department of Education under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by Democracy Forward, the National Center for Youth Law, and the National Women’s Law Center, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys’ fees.

Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Department of Education’s decision to rescind sexual violence guidance documents issued in 2011 and 2014 created educational access disparities on the basis of sex and hampered the plaintiffs' ability to do their jobs. The complaint argued that the new policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. It further argued that the decision had been made without the proper procedures, in violation of the APA.

On February 21, 2018, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, including several new factual allegations regarding accusations of sexual assault against top government officials and adverse changes to universities’ policies as a result of the Title IX guidance. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue and that the plaintiffs failed to plead that the Department of Justice had a discriminatory purpose on May 2, 2018.

On August 31, 2018, non-profit organizations Women’s and Children’s Advocacy Project, Equal Means Equal, National Coalition Against Violent Athletes, Allies Reaching for Equality, Women Matter, and We are Women filed a motion for leave to intervene as plaintiffs. These organizations argued that the parties and court did not address the issues raised in the organizations’ amicus curiae briefs as the plaintiffs did not amend the complaint to argue in favor of the right to equal treatment. 

Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted the May 2, 2018 motion to dismiss on October 1, 2018 because the allegations were insufficient to show standing to bring an equal protection claim; the 2017 Guidance was not a final agency action for purposes of an APA claim; and the allegations did not plausibly suggest that the defendants acted outside their authority for the ultra vires claim. 2018 WL 4770741. The first and third claims were dismissed without prejudice and with leave to amend, while the APA claim was dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 31, 2018 and the organizations refiled a motion for leave to intervene as plaintiffs on November 20, 2018. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on December 14, 2018.

On February 19, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the APA claim. 

On March 29, 2019, Judge Corley denied the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of Article III standing but granted their motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' equal protection and ultra vires claims. 2019 WL 143141. On that same day, Judge Scott granted the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, finding that a recent Ninth Circuit decision warranted reconsidering the plaintiffs' APA claim. 2019 WL 1434144. Finally, Judge Corley denied the motion to intervene, finding that the motion was untimely, that the intervenors failed to establish Article III standing, and that the intervenors' interests were adequately represented by the existing plaintiffs. 2019 WL 1427447. 

On April 18, 2019, the plaintiffs submitted a Third Amended Complaint, removing the ultra vires and equal protection claims and reinserting the APA claim. 

The plaintiffs and defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On November 1, 2019, Judge Corley denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants' motion. 2019 WL 5684522. She agreed with the defendants' argument that the challenged agency action was not ""final"" for purposes of judicial review under the APA. The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit. The appeal is pending. ","Filed by Equal Rights Advocates, SurvJustice Inc, Victim Rights Law Center. ( filed by Equal Rights Advocates, SurvJustice Inc, Victim Rights Law Center.

The 1997 Guidance provided that “‘informal mechanisms’ 2\n\n\x0cCase 3:18-cv-00535-JSC Document 81 Filed 10/01/18 Page 3 of 21\n\nUnited States District Court Northern District of California\n\n1 for resolving complaints,” such as mediation, “may be used by mutual consent of the parties but\n\n2 that it was inappropriate for a complaining student to be required to work out the problem directly\n\n3 with the individual accused of harassment.” ( In addition, since the 2017 Title IX Policy no longer\n24 requires colleges and universities to resolve reports of sexual violence in a timely fashion, VRLC\n25 has observed a trend in educational institutions not responding or not responding as promptly to 26\n27\n28 Second Amended Complaint for Injunctive Relief; Case No.: Similarly, and for example, in the past, Secretary DeVos has provided substantial 4\nfinancial contributions—a form of speech—to FIRE, an organization that advocates for schools 5 6 to abdicate their responsibility to address sexual violence and instead defer entirely to law 7 enforcement.17 FIRE asserts that the 2011 Dear Colleague Letter “eviscerated due process rights\n8 of students and faculty accused of sexual misconduct on campus. FOIA records also show that in May 2017, Ms. Jackson telephoned Gordon E. Finley\n11 regarding his writing on issues related to sexual assault. For example, FOIA records show that on July 18, 2017, Candice Jackson discussed a\n\n10 book titled “Unwanted Advances: If this is feminism, it’s feminism hijacked by melodrama”\n11 with OCR staff and remarked on “how helpful it has been in reference to the issues we are 12\ndiscussing.” 3:18-cv-00535-JSC Page: 41\n\n\x0cCase 3:18-cv-00535-JSC Document 86 Filed 10/31/18 Page 42 of 53\n\n1 assured that her educational institution should resolve the investigation within about sixty days,\n\n2 and among other protections, she would not be cross-examined by the person who allegedly\n3 assaulted her. Limiting Title IX’s\n\n9 protections disproportionately impacts female students, a fact which motivated decisionmakers.\n\n10 Specifically, decisionmakers at the Department hold the discriminatory views, as evidenced by\n11 Secretary DeVos’s and Ms. Jackson’s statements and coordination with others who hold the 12\nsame views, that (1) many girls and women who report sexual harassment, including sexual 13 14 violence, have misunderstood a harmless romantic advance and (2) most girls and women who\n15 report sexual violence either are lying or have regret about a consensual sexual encounters. As outlined more fully in paragraphs 10-34, the consequences of the Department’s 2017 20\nTitle IX Policy have harmed and continue to harm Plaintiffs. SurvJustice also 3 engages in policy advocacy to promote robust protections for survivors and to dispel rape myths 4\nabout women and girls like those advocated by Ms. Jackson in her statement to the New York 5 6 Times. As a result of Defendants’ unlawful actions, Plaintiffs have been harmed and their\n23 missions frustrated, as outlined more fully in paragraphs 10-34 above.\n\n24\n\nCount Two\n\n(Ultra Vires Action)58 25\n\n26 58 Plaintiffs are not alleging additional facts in support of their ultra vires claim, but maintain it\n27 for the purpose of appeal, if necessary.\n28\n\nSecond Amended Complaint for Injunctive Relief; Case No.: v.

Legal Consequences\n\n15\n\nPlaintiffs argue that “Gill extends the holding of Oregon Natural Desert,” because it holds\n\n16 “that even loss of membership in a voluntary program based on a breach of a user agreement,\n\n17 rather than a statute or regulation, is a legal consequence under Bennett where that agreement\n\n18 requires that the participant comply with agency policies.” ( No.\n\n24 115 at 10), likewise does not satisfy their burden because it does not address the Assurance’s\n\n25 affirmative statement that “financial assistance can be terminated and the applicant can be\n\n26 declared ineligible to receive further assistance” for failure to comply, see U.S. Dep’t of Educ.

JC-AZ-0016,"COVID-19 Summary: This class action lawsuit was filed on June 16, 2020 by detainees in the Maricopa County Jail system in Arizona, who sought extra protections from COVID-19 and, in some cases, release. The Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on August 14, 2020.<hr>This is a lawsuit challenging the Maricopa County Sheriff's response to COVID-19 in its jails and requesting the release of detainees and prisoners. On June 16, 2020, nine named plaintiffs and the immigrants' rights non-profit Puente Human Rights Movement filed this class action law suit and habeas petition in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs sued Maricopa County and its Sheriff under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12131), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794) and petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Represented by the national and Arizona ACLUs, as well as several law firms working pro bono, the plaintiffs sought to certify several classes of detainees and prisoners, the release of certain individuals at high risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19, and injunctions governing the Sheriff's response to COVID-19 in Maricopa County's jails, as well as attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs claimed that their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, were violated by the Sheriff's response to COVID-19.

The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants placed them in danger of contracting COVID-19 by continuing to book new detainees in the jail without quarantining them from the existing population, as well as a host of other unsafe practices, including a lack of masks and cleaning supplies, little testing for individuals held in the jail or jail staff, and crowded conditions that prevented social distancing. According to the complaint, the pretrial detainees' Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by the conditions of their confinement, which amounted to deliberate indifference and unconstitutional punishment prior to conviction. The convicted prisoners made a similar Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim. Additionally, the subclasses of prisoners with disabilities claimed that their rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to equal access to jail programming were violated by the defendants' COVID-19 response. Finally, the plaintiffs requested that the court release medically vulnerable pretrial detainees.

The case was assigned to United States District Judge Steven P. Logan. On June 29, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering them to improve COVID-19 safety protocols and begin releasing medically vulnerable pretrial detainees. Judge Logan denied the plaintiffs' ex parte request, but set a briefing schedule to determine whether to grant a similar preliminary injunction on July 2, 2020. The defendants then moved to dismiss the case on July 20, 2020. 

Judge Logan resolved both of these motions in an August 14, 2020 opinion. He denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. He also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss some of the plaintiffs' municipal liability claims against the Sheriff, but not the County. 

Shortly after the filing of the lawsuit, back on June 29, 2020, the plaintiffs had moved for class certification. Judge Logan granted that motion in a November 13, 2020 opinion and certified two classes, one of detainees incarcerated pending trial and one of convicted prisoners, and four subclasses (two within each class) of medically vulnerable individuals and individuals with disabilities.

After class certification was granted, the parties began the discovery process. The case is ongoing.

VR-RI-0022,"On February 14, 2014, the ACLU of Rhode Island and several citizens of the City of Cranston filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Rhode Island. The plaintiffs sued the City of Cranston under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Prison Policy Initiative, the ACLU, and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs claim that the 2012 Redistricting Plan violated the rights of the plaintiffs to equal representation under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the inclusion of the prison population of Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), located in Ward 6, inflated the actual voting population of ward 6. As a result, every three citizens of Ward 6 represent the same voting power as four citizens of the other five wards. 

On March 13, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss. On September 8, 2014, Judge Ronald R. Lagueux denied the motion, holding that the court could not say that the 2012 Redistricting Plan was constitutional as a matter of law. 42 F.Supp. 3d 325 (D.R.I. 2014).  The court scheduled discovery for the next nine months. 

On July 9, 2015, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On August 6, 2016, a cross-motion for summary judgment was filed by the plaintiffs. 

On May 24, 2016, Judge Lagueux granted plaintiffs’ summary judgment and denied defendants'. 188 F.Supp.3d 146. The court entered declaratory judgment for the plaintiffs and enjoined the defendants from holding any new elections under the current 2012 Redistricting Plan. Furthermore, the defendants were required to come up with a new redistricting plan within 30 days. Judge Lagueux determined that while districts are generally divided according to equal populations, the prison inmates at ACI were not engaged in the civil process like other non-voters. Therefore, to include them in the total population of Ward 6 would an unconstitutional dilution of Ward’s 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5’s voting power. 

On May 31, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to appeal. On September 21, 2016, Judge Sandra Lea Lynch of the First Circuit Court of Appeals entered judgment in favor of the defendants. 837 F.3d 135. Judge Lynch held, following the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Evenwel v. Abbott</i>, that in the absence of discriminatory intent, the courts should defer to local election authorities and the political process. Accordingly, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Sept. 26, 2016.

She regularly votes in Cranston elections. Plaintiff Sylvia Weber resides at 84 Shaw Avenue in the City of Cranston, has resided at that address for more than 30 days, is over the age of 18, and is a registered voter in Cranston City Council Ward 1. The City Council of Cranston has nine members, six of whom are elected by individual wards and three of whom are elected city-wide. Instead, they remain residents of the communities where they lived prior to their incarceration. Upon information and belief, incarcerated persons at the ACI cannot voluntarily visit or patronize public or private establishments in Cranston such as restaurants, hotels, grocery stores, gas stations, schools, movie theaters, museums, musical performances, shops, parks, playgrounds, athletic fields, theatres, churches, businesses, recreational centers, or public transportation.\n19. Without the prison population, the deviation between the largest ward and Ward Six is approximately 35%.2\nEach ward elects one representative to the City Council and one to the School Committee. Additionally, three at-large city councilors and one at-large school committee member are selected by voters from all six wards. Inmates may be serving sentences or awaiting trial. Inmates are only rarely permitted to leave the facility. Similarly, Mayor Allan Fung, who has served as Cranston’s mayor since his election in 2008, reports that he has only visited the ACI once during his mayoral tenure, for a tour of the facility. Jaroma v. Massey, 873 F.2d 17, 20 (1st Cir. Id. In the present case, the parties disagreed about some of the population figures and some of the mathematical calculations. At any rate, the discrepancies noted by the parties were not material to the outcome of the dispute.\nAnalysis In ruling on Defendant’s Motion to Dismiss, this Court reviewed Supreme Court voting-rights jurisprudence and the notion of “One Man, One Vote.” at 1126 (emphasis in the original).\nThe inmates at the ACI share none of the characteristics of\nthe constituencies described by the Supreme Court. Because of these distinctions, the Court cannot stretch the holding of Evenwel to cover the inmate population at ACI.\nCalvin v. Jefferson County A federal court in Florida recently issued a ruling in a voting rights case with facts almost identical to the facts before this Court. Nonetheless, Judge Mark Walker held that the inclusion of the prison population in the County’s districting plan was\n-12-\n\n\x0cCase 1:14-cv-00091-L-LDA Document 35 Filed 05/24/16 Page 13 of 15 PageID #: 778\nunconstitutional. Id., at *24.\nJudge Walker’s opinion is well-reasoned and extensive. Likewise, when campaigning in Ward Six, a candidate need only knock on seven doors, rather than ten doors in the other wards. Nonetheless, the City ultimately adopted the plan, causing Plaintiffs ongoing and irreparable harm. The plausibility standard is not akin to a probability requirement, but it asks for more than a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted unlawfully.\n556 U.S. 662, 678 (2009) (internal citations omitted).\nAnalysis\nThe right to vote, be counted and be represented\nThe United States Supreme Court has consistently recognized\nthat the right to vote and to have one’s vote counted is a\nfundamental tenet of our democracy. Id. at 846.\nIn Avery v. Midland County, Texas, 390 U.S. 474, 484-85 (1968), the Supreme Court extended its holding in Reynolds v. Sims to intrastate districting. (“ Currently, the group includes, inter alia, children, non-citizens and prisoners. All of these groups have been the subject of federal voting rights litigation. 2000)(noncitizens and minors); Fletcher v. Lamone, 831 F. Supp.2d 887 (D.Md. Consequently, the Supreme Court has approved efforts to adjust Census figures to achieve districts with greater voting parity, as long as those efforts are employed consistently. The Ninth Circuit\naddressed the importance of representational equality in Garza v.\nCounty of Los Angeles:\nThe framers were aware that this apportionment and representation base would include categories of persons who were ineligible to vote – women, children, bound servants, convicts, the insane, and, at a later time, aliens. The Fifth\nCircuit has indicated that, in its view, this kind of arrangement\nmay not be constitutionally acceptable:\n...[G]enerally, the ineligible to vote or to register to do so (whether felons, minors, or noncitizens) can be assumed to be evenly distributed throughout the area to be districted, and the usage of total population is thus an acceptable surrogate for measuring potential voters. When, however, a districting body knows that large numbers of those ineligible to vote are disproportionately concentrated in certain areas, it can no longer in good faith use total population as a proxy for potential voters. The district court held that the inclusion in the Redistricting Plan of 3,433 inmates of the Adult Correctional Institutions (""ACI"") in the population count of the City\'s Ward Six, the ward in which the ACI is physically located, dilutes the votes of voters in the City\'s other five wards in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. shall be as nearly equal in population . . . 28950 (May 20, 2015).\nThe 2010 Census data used by Cranston in its 2012 Redistricting Plan, the most recent such plan, included in its population count for the City 3,433 inmates of the ACI. Unlike those non-voting residents, many of the inmates are forbidden by law from voting in Cranston.\nAnd though college students ""are most certainly affected by municipal regulations,"" the court concluded that the ACI inmates have no stake in the local political process. The City argues that we have jurisdiction pursuant both to 28 U.S.C. § 1291, which grants us jurisdiction over ""appeals from all final decisions of the district courts of the United States,"" and to 28 U.S.C. § 1292(a)(1), which grants us jurisdiction over ""[i]nterlocutory orders of the district courts of the United States . . .

EE-FL-0048,"On September 27, 2002, the Miami office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit under Title VII against Federal Express Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.  The EEOC alleged that the defendant had violated the complainant's rights by constructively discharging him in retaliation for complaints of racial discrimination that he made on behalf of two interviewees.  On October 10, 2002, the complainant intervened in the case as a plaintiff, alleging that he was entitled to punitive damages under the Florida Whistleblower Act.

On April 13, 2004, Federal Express asked the court for summary judgment, but the district court denied that motion on October 13, 2004.  After several failed attempts to settle through mediation, the case went to trial on December 13, 2004.  After four days at trial, the jury issued a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding the complainant $201,010.30 in lost wages and $1.37 million in compensatory damages for emotional pain and mental anguish.  The defendants asked the court to reverse the verdict by issuing judgment as a matter of law in their favor, or, in the alternative, to grant them a new trial.  The court denied these motions, but it did grant their further motion to reduce the compensatory damage award to $350,000.  The plaintiff was given his choice of either accepting this reduced amount or going to a new trial on the compensatory damage award.  

A second jury trial was held on the issue of punitive damages on December 22, 2004.  On the same day, the jury found that the plaintiff was not entitled to punitive damages.  The complainant reached a later settlement with the defendant regarding his fees and costs.

Meanwhile, the district court issued another order on May 5, 2005, denying the plaintiff's request for front pay, but issuing an injunction against the defendants that required them to redistribute their anti-discrimination policy to all management officials with supervisory authority over employees at its Maitland, Florida location.  After this decision was issued, the plaintiff decided to accept the reduced compensatory damages award.

The defendants appealed all of these judgments to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, asking the Eleventh Circuit to grant them judgment as a matter of law.  The plaintiff cross-appealed, asked the Eleventh Circuit to award him front pay.  On May 11, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit found that the district court's decisions had no reversible error, and they held that the lower court's rulings would stand.  E.E.O.C. v. Federal Express Corp., 180 Fed.Appx. 865 (11th Cir. 2006).

","As stated with greater particularity in paragraph 7 below, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (hereinafter ""EEOC"" or the ""Commission"") alleges that Mr. Maines was unlawfully disciplined and constructively discharged by Defendant Federal Express Corporation (hereinafter ""Federal Express"") in retaliation for opposing what he reasonably believed to be a practice made unlawful under Title VII.\n\n\x0cJURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. Additionally, as recently as January 16, 2001, MR. MAINES then presented the interview and selection process materials to FEDERAL EXPRESS’ Personnel Representative, Mr. Eddie Jenkins, for evaluation and final approval of the top 2 candidates.\n15. MAINES complained to his (then) direct supervisor, Ms. Christian, that he believed that Ms. Mattman’s actions in nullifying the interview and selection process were discriminatory given the fact that Ms. Guadalupe Miller was a minority (an Hispanic), while Ms. Ruston was not.\n18. These criticisms were false, unwarranted and were obviously meted out with the approval and encouragement of Ms. Mattman (Defendant FEDERAL EXPRESS’ Vice President of Worldwide Revenue Operations) in retaliation for MR. MAINES to compensatory and punitive damages pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §§\n\n1981a and 2000e-5(g) to punish FEDERAL EXPRESS for its actions and to deter it, and\n\nothers, from taking such actions in the future.\n\n43.

Mr. Maines hangs his hat on this last clause,\ncontending that the punitive damages he seeks qualify as ""other compensatory damages allowable at law"" because Sections 768.71 and 768.72 provide a substantive rightto recover punitive damages.\nHowever, Mr. Maines\'s argument is not persuasive. By all accounts, prior to the incidents described below, Maines was considered to be an outstanding employee. In March of 2000, Christian and Mattman conferred a “FedEx Superstar” rating on Maines, signifying a rating in the top 1% of salaried employees in his division.\n1The Court has distilled these facts from each of the parties’ “statement of undisputed material facts,” to the extent there was general agreement. On February 2, 2001, Maines then extended offer letters to the two successful candidates.\nMattman learned of the selections and that Lauren Ruston, one of her own managers who applied for the job, was not selected and emailed Christian on February 5, 2001, that she was “concerned” about Maines’ hiring selections and stated “unless she is exceptional, i doubt i would have approved hiring an admin. In determining whether the moving party has satisfied its burden, the court considers all inferences drawn from the underlying facts in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion, and resolves all reasonable doubts against the moving party. See Shannon, 292 F.3d at 716 n.2 (statutorily protected activity included plaintiff’s voicing of complaints of discrimination to supervisors); Pipkins, 267 F.3d at 1201; see also Rollins v. Fla.

There is enough here to present a genuine issue for trial.\nCONCLUSION Because the record contains genuine issues of disputed material fact, summary judgment is not appropriate. The fact that Mr. Maines may now realize that some of the calculations in the paperwork were done incorrectly does not affect whether he had a good-faith belief at the pertinent time. And, as noted in the Report, Ms. Miller\'s lack of qualification would not have anything to do with whether Ms. Reece - whose promotion was also revoked - was qualified.\n-4-\n\n\x0cCase 6:02-cv-01112-JA-DAB Document 83 Filed 10/13/2004 Page 5 of 7\nThe second factual statement challenged by FedEx is that ""Jenkins reviewed the selection matrix and authorized the selection of Reece and Miller."" 6:02-cv-1112-0rl-28DAB\n\nFEDERAL EXPRESS CORPORATION,\n\nDefendant.\n\nVERDICT 1.

IM-PA-0017,"COVID-19 Summary: This is a hybrid putative class action and habeas action filed by a group of medically vulnerable individuals being held in civil detention by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at York County Prison and Pike County Correctional Facility. The plaintiffs seek safety remedies and release from detention in light of COVID-19. The court granted the plaintiffs’ temporary restraining order on April 7, 2020. Defendants appealed. The Third Circuit vacated and remanded the decision for a temporary restraining order on August 25, 2020. The case is ongoing. <hr>

A group of 22 medically vulnerable plaintiffs in civil detention facing potential deportation filed a hybrid putative class action and habeas corpus proceeding in the United States District Court Middle District of Pennsylvania asking for release in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 3, 2020, represented by the ACLU of Pennsylvania and the law firm Dechert LLP, the plaintiffs asked for a temporary restraining order against the detention centers and their wardens, including Mr. Clair Doll in his official capacity as the warden of the York County Prison, Craig A. Lowe as Warden of Pike County Correctional Facility, Simona Flores-Lund as Field Office Director, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Matthew Albence as Acting Director of ICE, and Chad Wolf as Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The plaintiffs based their request to the court on the defendants’ alleged failures to adequately protect high-risk detainees from contracting COVID-19. Since March 31, 2020, the conditions at the facilities had deteriorated, with cramped, overcrowded facilities hindering social distancing, increased numbers of positive COVID-19 test results, and the rising necessity of quarantining. They based their claim for relief on the similarities between this case and Thakker v. Doll (found <a href=""https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17460"">here</a> in the Clearinghouse), where the court found that the ICE detention centers could not provide adequately safe conditions for the detainees and thereby ordered their release.

On April 7, 2020, Judge John E. Jones III of the federal district court issued a temporary restraining order and granted the immediate release of the 22 plaintiffs. On April 10, the defendants’ Application to Stay all Proceedings Pending Appeal was denied. 

The case was appealed to the the Third Circuit, which vacated and remanded the the decision for a temporary restraining order on August 25, 2020. See Hope v. Warden York Cty. Prison, 2020 U.S. App. LEXIS 26968. The case is ongoing.

They have no control over their soap rations or access to other sanitization products. On March 13, 2020, as infection rates began to increase in Pennsylvania at an alarming rate, the American Civil Liberties Foundation (ACLU) of Pennsylvania sent a letter to Defendant Flores-Lund, and other agency officials, alerting them to the high risk of COVID-19 infection in detention facilities and the dangerous health outcomes of an infection for vulnerable individuals.

PC-FL-0010,"In the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, a group of state prisoners filed a class action complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on September 12, 2003.  The plaintiffs' attorneys included lawyers of the Florida Institutional Legal Services, Inc., the Florida Justice Institute, Inc., the Southern Poverty Law Center, and private counsel.  The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees, from the defendant state officials, basing their complaint upon allegations that Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) officers improperly used chemical agents (tear gas and pepper spray) against prisoners in ""non-spontaneous"" circumstances.  (Spontaneous circumstances, the plaintiffs explained, were those presenting an immediate need to use force without time for reflection or planning.)  

According to the complaint, rather than use the chemical agents as a good-faith means of maintaining prison order and discipline, the officers used these chemicals maliciously and sadistically, contravening the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment,.  The complaint detailed numerous instances of chemical agent misuse, in violation of applicable FDOC regulations governing use of force,.  The complaint also set out allegations of officials' use of stronger-than-authorized chemical agents,  officials' increasingly-common resort to use of chemical agents when unauthorized by regulations, their failure to fairly investigate and act upon prisoners' grievances stemming from the misuse and overuse of these sprays, and purposeful neglect of post-use procedures to limit pain and injury stemming from these chemicals. Plaintiffs sought an injunction that would forbidthe excessive and unjustified use of these chemical agents and require that the defendants develop and submit to the court a comprehensive plan ensuring only the constitutionally-justified use of this form of discipline.

On July 14, 2004, in an unpublished order, District Judge John E. Steel denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, finding that the plaintiffs had standing and had sufficiently alleged facts which, if proven true, would entitle them to relief.  Judge Steel later, on September 20, 2004, denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and expressed reluctance to interfere in prison operations, at least at this stage of the proceedings.

The effort to have plaintiffs' case certified as a class action was rejected by Judge Steel on June 21, 2005.  According to the court, the fact-intensive nature of the use of these sprays by correctional officers precluded his finding that the factual allegations by the named plaintiffs had sufficient typicality and commonality with other and future prisoners' circumstances.  Plaintiffs' attempt to have Judge Steel reconsider his denial of class action status was denied on July 21, 2005.

On November 28, 2005, the case was dismissed without prejudice, after the parties had, on November 23, 2005, filed a stipulation of dismissal, with each party to bear its own costs and expenses.  Although this suggests that a settlement occurred, we have neither a copy of a settlement agreement nor any information about settlement terms.

","The defendants have violated Plaintiffs’ right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment by using chemical agents, including pepper spray and tear gas, maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm and not in a good-faith effort to restore order or maintain discipline or for any other legitimate penological reason. Plaintiff JiJuan T. Hagans is currently incarcerated at Union Correctional Institution, located in Union County, Florida. Plaintiff Samuel Strother, at all times material to this action, and currently, is incarcerated at Charlotte Correctional Institution, located in Charlotte County, Florida.\n26. When the events giving rise to his claim arose, he was incarcerated at Florida State Prison, located in Bradford County, Florida.\n28. He is sued in his official capacity.\n33. Controlling issues of law and fact are also common to all members of the Plaintiff class in that Florida Department of Corrections supervisory employees routinely participate,\n- 8 -\n\n\x0cfacilitate, encourage, or acquiesce in the behavior of their subordinates and are fully aware that chemical agents are used maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm and not in a good-faith effort to maintain or restore discipline, and with that knowledge, fail to take any corrective action.\n41. If this attempt to counsel with the inmate is unsuccessful, the inmate will be given a final order by staff to cease his actions. Rule 33-602.210(14)(m)(2)(b), F.A.C., also requires that prior to using chemical agents\nthe warden or duty warden be contacted for “authorization to utilize chemical agents.” In response to Plaintiff Butler’s requests for medical assistance, Captain Chastain and Correctional Officer Reeder turned off the exhaust fans, approached Plaintiff Butler’s cell, unlocked the food flap and Reeder began spraying chemical agents into the cell.\n107. He also falsely stated that he used only three 1-second bursts of pepper spray and of tear gas.\n- 21 -\n\n\x0c111. Plaintiff Butler developed large, water filled blisters on his hip. His appeal to Defendant Crosby was denied on May 28, 2003, stating that the subject of his grievance was being reviewed by the investigative section of the Inspector General’s office. He continued to have difficulty breathing and vomited several times. On April 9, 2003, Plaintiff LaFlower reported this incident in an informal grievance and was told that his allegations were being referred to the Inspector General’s office and that his grievance was “approved for I.G. reporting purposes only.” Because Plaintiff McCloud\'s release date is not until May,\n- 41 -\n\n\x0c2026, there is a real possibility that he will again be subject to the unjustified use of chemical agents at some time during the course of his incarceration if the current policies, practices and customs concerning the use of chemical agents continue.\nLamar A. Miffin and Issac Sharpe 225. On September 24, 2001, while Plaintiffs Miffin and Sharpe were in full restraints, consisting of leg irons and handcuffs secured with a black box, and waiting in line with the other inmates to get on the bus back to Florida State Prison, Lieutenant Copeland and Correctional Officers Williams and Stoe pulled them out of line and locked them in cages in the visiting park. As a direct and proximate result of chemical agents on April 29, 2003, Plaintiff Strother suffered an asthma attack.\n258. Plaintiff Strother is currently assigned to Close Management I status at Charlotte Correctional Institution. Within a few hours of his arrival back at Florida State Prison on July 13, 2000, security staff sprayed a large quantity of chemical agents into Plaintiff Thomas\'s locked cell.\n- 49 -\n\n\x0cPrior to this use of force, Plaintiff Thomas was not misbehaving and had merely asked security for assistance.\n265. In an effort to cover up this unnecessary use of chemical agents, Correctional Officer Lindsey wrote a Use of Force Report, falsely stating that Plaintiff Ulrath was kicking on his cell door and refusing all orders to stop. Plaintiff Ulrath is currently assigned to Close Management I status and housed in the inpatient mental health unit at Union Correctional Institution. He also falsely stated that he only used a total of six one-second bursts of pepper spray.\n306. In a further effort to cover up this improper use of chemical agents, Plaintiff Williams received a disciplinary report falsely charging that he was participating in a disturbance while inside his cell.\n307. Defendants Crosby and Abdul-Wasi, by failing to meet their responsibilities pursuant to Rule 33-602.210, F.A.C., and the grievance process, facilitate, encourage, and acquiesce in the behavior of their subordinates, who routinely use chemical agents maliciously and sadistically for the very purpose of causing harm and not in a good-faith effort to restore order or maintain discipline or for any other legitimate penological reason.\n327.

ED-NY-0008,"On August 18, 2009, the plaintiff, a high school student verbally and physically harassed due to his sex and sexual orientation brought suit against Mohawk Central School District in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of New York (The Honorable David N. Hurd). The plaintiff, represented by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the New York Civil Liberties Union, alleged denial of equal protection on the basis of sex and sexual orientation in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; discrimination based on sex and sexual orientation and negligent supervision under New York state law; and sex discrimination in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. Based on these claims, the plaintiff requested a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs, and compensatory, punitive, and statutory damages.

The plaintiff claimed that from 2007 to 2009, he suffered physical and emotional harms due to the defendant's deliberate indifference to a pattern of severe, persistent, and violent harassment of the plaintiff at the hands of fellow students based on his sex and sexual orientation. These physical and emotional harms also affected the plaintiff's ability to learn and caused him to leave school for two weeks at the end of the 2009 school year. The plaintiff and his parents informed school administrators and teachers of the harassment on many separate occasions, but no effective measures were taken by the school to remedy the situation.

On August 19, 2009, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. The Court issued a consent order granting the preliminary injunction on August 27, ordering the defendant to immediately put in place a number of safeguards to protect the plaintiff and to comply with school sexual harassment policies. 

The United States (U.S. Attorney's Office) moved to intervene on behalf of the plaintiff in the action on January 14, 2010. The court denied the motion on March 29, 2010 as it granted the parties' stipulation and settlement agreement. Under the agreement, the defendant was required to pay the plaintiff $50,000 in addition to attorney's fees and costs ($25,000) and the cost of obtaining counseling services up until June 30, 2013. The agreement also required that the defendant retain an expert to review the defendant's policies and practices regarding discrimination and harassment, to review these procedures themselves, and to record compliance with harassment and discrimination complaints. 

The case was dismissed with prejudice on April 27, 2010.

Defendants never forwarded the complaints about\nharassment of J.L. to the School District\'s designated Compliance Officer as required by\nSuperintendent Policy #7531, ""·Sexual Harassment of Students."" The School District\'s anti-harassment policy also requires the Compliance Officer\nto consult with the Superintendent and/or counsel upon receiving a verbal or written complaint of discriminatory harassment.\n78.

CJ-OH-0002,"On December 31, 2003, Lewis Williams and John Roe, who were both death-sentenced inmates of the Mansfield Correctional Institution in Mansfield, Ohio filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  Williams and Roe asked the Court to stay their executions and issue an injunction against the defendants' use of their current lethal injection protocol, which they alleged would violate their Constitutional rights by torturing them to death.  Specifically, they feared that the short-acting anesthetic used by the defendants would wear off too soon, allowing them to feel the excrutiatingly painful effects of the potassium chloride that was used during the lethal injection process.  In addition, they argued that the defendants' use of pancuronium bromide would paralyze them, making them unable to cry out or alert their executioners that the anesthetic had worn off too soon.  

The defendants argued that the complaint was in reality a successive habeas petition, which needed to be transferred to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and that the District Court had no jurisdiction over the claim.  On January 6, 2004, the District Court (Judge James L. Graham) construed the petition as a successive habeas petition and transferred the case to the Sixth Circuit.  

On February 3, 2004, the Sixth Circuit granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, ruling that this was a successive habeas petition, and that the plaintiffs had not met the requirements for filing a successive habeas petition.  The plaintiffs sought review by the U.S. Supreme Court, and on March 5, 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of certiorari.  

Lewis Williams was executed by lethal injection on January 14, 2004.

John Roe was executed by lethal injection on February 3, 2004.

Nature of Action 1. Plaintiffs seeks equitable and injunctive relief. In this action, Plaintiffs claim that Defendants\' current method of lethal injection can and will, in effect, cause them to be tortured to death. No government within the United States can intentionally or negligently use an excruciatingly painful, arbitrary, cruel, and unreliable method of execution. This lawsuit is not a successor habeas petition. Lewis Williams, Jr., is a United States citizen and a resident of the State of Ohio. The Ohio Supreme Court has ordered that Mr. Williams is to be executed on January 14,2004. Upon information and belief, it is the intention of Defendants, acting in concert with other state officials not named as defendants herein, to use the lethal injection methods described herein to execute Mr. Williams on January 14,2004, in the death house located on the grounds of the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility (operated and controlled by the Defendants) in Lucasville, Ohio. He is sued here in his individual and official capacity for the purpose of obtaining declaratory and injunctive relief. Pursuant to Ohio Revised Code Section 5120.38, Defendant Haviland, as the Warden of SOCF, is charged with management of SOCF and the oversight and conduct of operations there, including the oversight and conduct of executions carried out there. 2201(a), in that, one purpose of this action is to secure declaratory relief; and under 28 U.S.c. § 1367, in that, the state and federal claims are derived from a common nucleus of operative facts. Upon information and belief, Defendants and/or their agents simply copied lethal injection procedures from another state or other states without investing meaningful and independent efforts designed to ensure that Ohio\'s lethal injection execution procedures comply with\n7\n\n\x0ccontemporary medical standards and long-standing legal standards that forbid the infliction of\nexcruciating, cruel, and unusual pain and punishment.\n22. According to the attached affidavit of Mark J.S. Heath (see Exhibit 3-note that due to the press\nof time and the fact Dr. Heath lives in New York City, Plaintiffs are filing a declaration\ncontaining an electronic signature; Plaintiffs will supplement the record with a document bearing\nDr. Pancuronium paralyzes all voluntary muscles, but does not affect sensation, consciousness, cognition, or the ability to feel pain and suffocation. Heath Affidavit 19.\nD) Based on the information available to me, It IS my opInIOn held to a reasonable degree of medical certainty that Ohio\'s lethal injection protocol creates an unacceptable risk that the inmate will not be anesthetized to the point of being unconscious and unaware of pain for the duration of the execution procedure. Regardless of the experience of the condemned prisoner, whether he or she is deeply unconscious or experiencing the excruciation of suffocation, paralysis, and potassium injection, he or she will appear to witnesses to be serene and peaceful due to the relaxation and immobilization of the facial and other skeletal muscles. Sodium thiopental is an ultrashort-acting barbiturate with a very short shelf life in liquid form. It does not appear that Ohio\'s protocol includes this ""continuous"" requirement. Based on my medical training and experience, and based upon my research of lethal injection procedures and practices, inadequacies in these areas elevate the risk that the lethal injection procedure will cause the condemned to suffer excruciating pain during the execution process. Firsthand Account of Adverse Effects of Drug 24. Defendants use of this drug serves only the purpose identified by Dr. Kris Sperry, M.D., a Medical Examiner for the State of Georgia, who said a neuromuscular blocking agent (like pancuronium) is used during lethal injection ""to paralyze all the muscles such that those outwardly aesthetically unpleasant things are not seen and do not occur."" State v. Michael Wayne Nance, Gwinnett County Superior Court, Indictment No. Inadequate Training of Execution Personnel 28. Specifically, using paralyzing agents violates veterinarians\' ethical standards. The American Veterinarian Medical Association\'s (AVMA) year 2000 Report on Euthenasia clearly declares that ""A combination of pentobarital [an anesthetic in the same category of drugs as thiopental] with a nuero-muscular blocking agent [like pancuronium] is not an acceptable euthenasia agent."" 17, § 1044 (enacted in 1987); Maryland, Md. Code Ann., See Exhibit 6 (chart outlining statutes). These statutory declarations, which embody societal values for the euthenasia of house pets, underscore the inhumanity of Defendants\' execution method. Pending Litigation in Other States Relevant to Plaintiffs\' Case 34. See Exhibit 9 (Nelson v. Campbell, _ U.S. _ , 124 S. Ct. Exhibit 10 (Nelson v. Campbell, 2003 U.S. Lexis 8577 (Case No. Rather, they simply seek to utilize 42 U.S.c. § 1983 as a legitimate means to stop Defendants from effectively torturing them to death. 1983 provides a remedy ""against all forms of official violation offederaUy protected rights."" 1994) (execution by lethal gas in California held unconstitutional where evidence indicated ""death by this method is not instantaneous. Death is not extremely rapid or within a matter of seconds. Further, ""[p]unishments are cruel when they involve ... a lingering death."" Second Claim: Fourteenth Amendment Due Process Violation\n42. C. Plaintiffs request that this Court grant Plaintiffs\' reasonable attorney fees pursuant to 42 U.S.c. § denied, McQueen v. Patton, 521 U.S. 1130 (1997), the Sixth Circuit held that a challenge to the method of execution brought as a civil rights claim under 42 U.S.C. §1983 was properly construed as a habeas corpus petition, and was therefore subject to the rules governing second or successive habeas corpus petitions. 03-6821, 2003 WL 22327593, 72 USLW 3363 (December 1, 2003).

IM-CA-0171,"On November 2, 2020, asylum seekers with disabilities and health conditions filed this putative class-action suit against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the Southern District of California. The suit alleged that defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by forcibly returning plaintiffs to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (the “MPP”). Under the MPP, asylum seekers entering the United States from Mexico were returned to Mexico and waited outside the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings. The plaintiffs stated that MPP conflicted with CBP’s own procedure at the time that asylum seekers with “known physical or mental health issues” cannot be sent to Mexico. They alleged that DHS failed to put in place effective methods to ensure that people with known physical or mental health conditions were exempt from MPP and to identify and assess, for accommodations, immigrants with disabilities. The plaintiffs sought an order enjoining the defendants from continuing forcible removal of class members under MPP and requiring the defendants to put in place practices and procedures in compliance with Section 504. They also requested attorneys’ fees. The plaintiffs were represented by the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center, Texas Civil Rights Project, and private counsel. The case was assigned to Judge Todd W. Robinson and Magistrate Judge Bernard G. Skomal.

On November 3, 2020, the case was related to Doe v. McAleenan, docket number 3:19-cv-2119, (<a href =""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17356"">IM-CA-0152</a> in the Clearinghouse). This case similarly challenged deportation under MPP. 

On December 22, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to stay pending the appeal of a separate case. The judge denied the motion on February 19, 2021. There were joint motions to continue on March 2, 2021. 

On December 23, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. They requested that defendants stop subjecting members of the putative class to the MPP. They further requested that defendants put in place mechanisms ensuring CBP’s protocols of exempting those with known physical or mental health issues was being carried out, that family members of the putative class were also excluded pursuant to the Family Unit Policy, and that defendants put in place practices and policies to identify immigrants with disabilities and provide accommodations necessary for those with disabilities to prepare for their asylum proceedings. On the same day, the plaintiffs also filed a motion requesting class certification for asylum seekers with disabilities and their family members. 

On February 22, 2021, Defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. As of March 12, 2021, there has not been a ruling on the motion.

E.H.M. is constantly worried about her brother.

IM-MA-0016,"On June 27, 2018, a refugee from Guatemala filed this lawsuit on behalf of herself and her daughter in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts against the Attorney General of the United States and officers and executives of the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, and Immigration and Customs Enforcement under the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 <i>et seq.</i>) and the Declaratory Judgment Act (22 U.S.C. § 2201). Represented by the ACLU of Massachusetts and private counsel, the plaintiff sought injunctive and declaratory relief, along with attorney’s fees. The plaintiff alleged that she and her daughter had been separated upon their entry to the United States in violation of their Fifth Amendment substantive and procedural due process rights and their equal protection rights. Additionally, the plaintiff alleged that the Office of Refugee Resettlement’s family reunification requirements violated the Administrative Procedure Act, and that the Department of Health and Human Services had violated the Flores Settlement’s requirements regarding immigrant detention. <i> See </i> <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9493"">Flores v. Reno</a>. Finally, the plaintiff filed petitions for mandamus and habeas relief for the defendants to release her daughter. 

The plaintiff brought the case in Massachusetts, where she was domiciled as she awaited her asylum hearing, while her daughter was kept in a shelter in Texas. The case was assigned to Judge George A. O’Toole. 

The following day, the plaintiff filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order for immediate injunctive relief, asking the court to order the release of the daughter. A copy of the motion was promptly sent to the defendants, who were ordered to respond by July 2, 2018. The defendants requested, and were granted, an extension until July 6. Rather than take advantage of the extension, the defendants decided to release her daughter. The plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case on July 5, 2018 after she and her daughter were reunited. The case is now closed.

Church on behalf of Angelica Rebeca Gonzalez−Garcia (Church, Susan) (Entered: 06/27/2018)\n10 Judge George A. O'Toole, Jr: ELECTRONIC ORDER entered. Angelica Rebeca Gonzalez-Garcia is an asylum-seeker whose seven-year-old daughter was forcibly separated from her, for no legitimate reason, by the United States government. Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia and S.K. arrived in the United States together and sought asylum in Arizona on or about May 9, 2018. In an act of unmitigated cruelty, when Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia was told that her daughter would be taken from her, an officer said, “Happy Mother’s Day. Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia was transferred from Arizona to a facility in Colorado, where an immigration judge later granted her bond and released her from custody. When Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia was finally able to speak to her daughter, she learned that during her detention, S.K. had been physically injured by another detained child, leaving her bruised and in pain, had contracted an infection that was reported to be conjunctivitis, had suffered a high fever, and was extremely fearful.\n5. Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia has been informed that the government intends continue to detain her unless Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia passes the screening to become a “sponsor” for her own child—which could take weeks, if not months. Having unlawfully taken S.K., the government is now requiring Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia to be screened as if she were a stranger to her own child.\n2\n4826-0906-6091.1\n\n\x0cCase 1:18-cv-11340-GAO Document 1 Filed 06/27/18 Page 3 of 14\n6. Yet it still refuses to reunite S.K. with Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia, who is now domiciled in Framingham, Massachusetts awaiting her asylum hearing.\n7. Plaintiff Angelica Rebeca Gonzalez-Garcia is a citizen of Guatemala. Plaintiff S.K. is a citizen of Guatemala. Defendant Thomas Homan is sued in his official capacity as the Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (“ICE”), and is a legal custodian of Plaintiff S.K. 15. Defendant Patrick Contreras is sued in his official capacity as he serves, upon information and belief, as the Director of the ICE Field Office for Enforcement Removal Operations in Houston, Texas, and is a legal custodian of Plaintiff S.K. 16. Customs and Border Protection (“CBP”) officials arrested her and her daughter. CBP transferred mother and daughter to a holding facility, where they were held in a room with approximately 30-40 other people. Ms. Garcia-Gonzalez, upon belief, was never charged with a crime. On May 11, 2018, Ms. Garcia-Gonzalez was forcibly separated from her sevenyear-old daughter. The separation served no legitimate legal or child welfare purpose. She currently is residing in Framingham, Massachusetts.\n5\n4826-0906-6091.1\n\n\x0cCase 1:18-cv-11340-GAO Document 1 Filed 06/27/18 Page 6 of 14\n26. With the assistance of counsel, Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia has undertaken every effort to have her daughter returned to her.\n28. But her release was still not permitted.\n29. Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia was informed that all individuals in the household in which she is staying would be required to submit fingerprints, and that the earliest opportunity to do this is July 16, 2018 in Newark, New Jersey.1 Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia was already fingerprinted by the government in May. There is no evidence, or even allegation, that Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia is in any way unable to care for S.K. By contrast, the efforts undertaken by Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia demonstrate that she is acting in the best interests of her child.\n31. Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia has not seen her daughter since she was taken from her on May 11, 2018. All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as though fully set forth herein. Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia and S.K., have a liberty interest under the Due Process Clause in remaining together as a family. The separation of Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia from her daughter, and the defendants’ ongoing failure to reunite them, violate substantive due process. These actions further no legitimate purpose and no compelling governmental interest. Moreover, Ms. Gonzalez-Garcia and her daughter were denied, and are still being denied, procedural due process. Classifications based on race or national origin receive exacting scrutiny, and even facially neutral policies and practices will be held unconstitutional when they reflect a pattern unexplainable on grounds other than race or national origin. Under the APA, “final agency action for which there is no other adequate remedy in court [is] subject to judicial review.” In June 2018, in the midst of public outcry involving the government’s practices of separating parents from children, ORR made it more difficult to release “unaccompanied” children by creating a new requirement that each adult household member in the home of the “sponsor” be fingerprinted. Under the policy, fingerprints are shared with DHS for immigration checks and criminal checks. ORR Policy Guide, Children Entering the United States Unaccompanied § 2.5.1 (revised June 7, 2018), available at acf.hhs.gov/orr/resource/children-entering-the-united-statesunaccompanied-section-2#2.5.1.\n46. What is more, complying with these procedures requires her to wait until July 16, 2018, for a fingerprint appointment in Newark. The settlement continues to be binding upon the government.3 See Flores v. Lynch, 828 F.3d 898, 905-06 (9th Cir.

JC-IL-0053,"On December 23, 2015, the plaintiff, a prisoner in the Cook County jail, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiff later amended the complaint twice, adding two plaintiffs and to seeking class-action certification. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sued both the Sheriff of Cook County in his official capacity and Cook County itself for damages under Section 202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs alleged that the Cook County Jail's policy of forced tapering of inmates participating in opioid antagonist therapy caused them great physical pain and thereby deprived them of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought class-action certification and compensatory damages for their pain and suffering. The case was assigned to Judge Edmond E. Chang.

The named plaintiffs all entered the Cook County Jail between late 2013 to early 2014. During that time, the plaintiffs informed intake personnel of their enrollment in opioid antagonist therapy. Each experienced extremely painful withdrawal symptoms after administration of their prescribed medical treatment was delayed. One entered the jail on January 20, 2014, and did not receive treatment until January 26, 2014. The second entered the jail on December 23, 2013, and did not receive treatment until December 25, 2013. The third entered the jail on September 12, 2013, and did not receive treatment until September 20, 2013.

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the claims, but Judge Chang denied the motion on June 27, 2016. Judge Chang noted that the plaintiffs may face difficulty in proving their claim, but declined to evaluate the facts at that stage of the litigation.

On November 29, 2020, the court granted class certification for the plaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims and denied class certification for the plaintiffs’ Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act claims. 2020 WL 7027556. The court held that the plaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims raised “questions that are necessarily common to all class members,” such as Cook County Jail officials’ state of mind when developing the tapering policy, whereas the plaintiffs’ ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims required individualized determinations. The court divided the class it into two classes: “Pre-trial Detainees” consisted of all pre-trial detainees who entered the Cook County Jail between December 23, 2013 and October 7, 2019 and who were lawfully taking an opioid antagonist when they entered. ; “Post-sentence Prisoners” consisted of all post-sentencing prisoners who were lawfully taking an opioid antagonist when they entered the Cook County Jail between the same time period.

Plaintiff sues Dart in his official capacity.\n5. This stigma arises, in part, from common misunderstandings about “opioid agonist therapy”. Tapering means that the Jail will reduce the amount of medication provided for a detainee’s “opioid agonist therapy” each day until the dosage is zero.\n13. 315 at 6, n.2.\nThe overwhelming majority of persons subjected to the tapering policy are, like plaintiff, released from custody before completing the regimen. 4 The 38 persons who left the Jail for the IDOC had been at the Jail between 2 and 32 days. reduce dose by 2 mg every day, reaching zero on Day 21. c.

Notify the Patient Scheduling office to enroll the patient in the OTP Clinic.\n10. Refer as needed to mental health and/or medical services; f. Provide additional patient education; g. If the patient opts to withdraw from the OTP, notify the divisional clinician to follow up. Maintenance rather than detoxification, for a reason other than pregnancy\nE. Diversion control 1. In addition, since December 2008, the Circuit Court has operated a Pre-Trial Services Unit within the Cook County Adult Probation Department to conduct brief assessments of felony defendants at bond hearings to provide judges with more information for decisions regarding pre-trial release.\nSince 1996, there have been between 9,000 and 10,000 inmates on any given day housed within the Cook County Jail, with an average daily population of just over 9,000 in 2010 (Figure 1). Specifically, African-Americans and Hispanics were more likely than whites to be admitted to the jail for a violent offense (30.5% and 31.2% versus 26.5%, respectively), whereas whites admitted to the jail were more likely than African-American and Hispanic to be detained for a property crime (21.2% versus 17.9% and 15.3%, respectively). Over the past few years, the number of admissions to, and exits from, the Cook County Jail have fallen, but the average daily\n\npopulation has not decreased as much. Again, an average increase of 3 days when multiplied by the 23,845 released because they posted bond translates into an increase in the average daily population of 196 inmates specifically because of this longer time to post cash bond.\nSimilarly, among those released from the jail because they were convicted and sentenced to the Illinois Department of Corrections, the time in the jail increased from an average of 105 days in 2007 to an average of 139 days in 2010. Also illustrative of the challenges facing the Cook County Jail, and indeed the entire criminal justice system in Cook County, is the fact that most of those released from the jail following their conviction and sentencing—either to prison, probation, supervision, or jail—end up coming back to the jail within a few years. The data available to plaintiff shows that between March 9, 2009 and March 19, 2011, 73 detainees who entered the Cook County Jail did not receive methadone until their fourth day at the jail.\n11.

That is the case here: the plaintiffs have argued that imposing a uniform linear-taper-to-zero policy is unlawful. Although patients’ withdrawal symptoms may vary, they are all caused by common conduct—the same linear-taper-to-zero policy, applied without exception to non-pregnant detainees.\nHaving said that, the governing legal standards will require, for the constitutional claims, that the class be split in two; and for the statutory claims, the applicable legal standard undermines the propriety of certification for the statute-based claims. of Corrections, 684 F.3d 667, 672 (7th Cir. Refusing to make reasonable accommodations is tantamount to denying access.” The question of what medication regimen constituted a reasonable accommodation—and thus, whether an accommodation was denied—varies by patient.\nIn response, the Plaintiffs do not really develop the statutory claims beyond bare assertions. But the defense largely restates its arguments against commonality. Both sides agree that Cook County Jail instituted a new written policy on October 7, 2019. As explained earlier, the Plaintiffs have raised common liability questions on the constitutional claims. At the liability stage, managing the class action will be relatively straightforward, relying primarily on evidence arising from the records governing the policy, testimony of certain Jail officials, and expert evidence.",0.7127,0.1916,0.302,0.1824,0.049,0.0772,0.2763,0.0743,0.1171
NS-NY-0024,"The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20"">special collection</a>.

On January 29, 2018, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) voted to disclose a memorandum (the Nunes Memo) revealing existence of a FISA warrant for the electronic surveillance of Carter Page, who served as a onetime foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign until September 2016. The Nunes Memo was declassified by President Donald Trump on February 2, 2018. The Nunes Memo revealed that on October 21, 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) sought and received a probable cause order from the FISC authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page. The Nunes Memo further disclosed that in addition to the initial warrant application, the government had received three renewal orders from the FISC.

On February 6, 2018, reporters Adam Goldman and Charlie Savage, along with the New York Times, filed a motion in the FISC for release of all court records, including opinions and application materials, in reference to the surveillance of Carter Page. See Misc. 18-01, <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16844"">NS-DC-0126</a> in this Clearinghouse.

On March 7, 2018, reporter Charlie Savage and the New York Times Company also filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for the same documents they requested in their FISC motion: the release of all documents regarding the surveillance of Carter Page.

On July 21, 2018, the DOJ produced redacted documents it considered responsive to the FOIA request. See In re Carter W. Page, <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17114"">NS-DC-0127</a> in this Clearinghouse.

On August 9, 2018, the parties stipulated to settle their claims. In exchange for The Times's agreement to dismiss this action, the DOJ agreed to provide to the Times any additional documents responsive to The Times's FOIA Request that are released in any related actions. On August 9, 2018, United States District Judge Analisa Torres approved the settlement.

JC-CA-0115,"On October 25, 2010, an inmate at the LA County Men's Central Jail filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiff sued Los Angeles County under 42 U.S.C. §1983. Represented by private counsel, he sought damages for alleged violations of the Fourth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution, as well as California state law. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that sheriff deputies used excessive force when the deputies beat him while he was handcuffed. The unprovoked attack caused severe injuries.

On May 23, 2011, Magistrate Judge Paul L. Abrams issued an <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/JC-CA-0115-0003.pdf"">order</a> compelling the disclosure of some discovery material requested by the plaintiff but also denying portions of the request. 

On October 12, 2011, Magistrate Abrams <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/JC-CA-0115-0004.pdf"">granted</a> the defendants' motion for a protective to stop the deposition of one party witness and one nonparty witness, but did denied the defendants' motion for two other nonparty witnesses.  2011 WL 7128640 (C.D. Cal. Oct. 12, 2011).

On December 15, 2011, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on twelve separate grounds, including that all of the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity. On February 23, 2012, Judge George H. Wu circulated a tentative ruling denying in part and granting in part the motion for summary judgement. Judge Wu allowed the parties to file three-page briefs regarding the points raised in the tentative ruling. In particular, Judge Wu denied the defendants qualified immunity. On April 12, 2012, Judge Wu issued a final ruling granting in part and denying in part the motion for summary judgment, including denying qualified immunity.

On May 9, 2012, defendants filed an interlocutory <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/JC-CA-0115-0005.pdf"">appeal</a> of the denial of qualified immunity in the tentative rulings filed in February and March, 2012.  On June 29, 2012, the parties agreed to a stipulated stay pending the appeal, and on July 6, 2012, Judge Wu granted the stay.

While the appeal was pending, the parties settled the case and agreed to dismiss the case with prejudice on April 1, 2013. The LA County Sheriff's Department agreed to pay $475,000. The settlement has not been made public.  The Ninth Circuit <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/JC-CA-0115-0006.pdf"">dismissed</a> the case because the settlement mooted the appeal. On April 3, 2013, the district court <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/JC-CA-0115-0007.pdf"">dismissed</a> the case with prejudice. 

In December 2013, one of the deputies (Deputy Fernando Luviano) who beat the plaintiff was included in a group  of 18 L.A.

PA-NY-0001,"On December 3, 2014, three women with relatives buried in a mass grave of more than one million deceased individuals on New York City’s Hart Island filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation, the plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, claiming violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Sections 3, 6, and 8 of Article I of the New York State Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that New York City’s policy barred people from visiting the graves of relatives buried on the island, only allowing them to visit a “gazebo” on the edge of Hart Island. The “gazebo” is out of sight of the graves and visitors were not permitted to leave sentimental items like flowers. 
 
The case was assigned to District Judge Vernon S. Broderick. On September 28, 2015, the court granted class certification, defining the class as: ""All parents, step-parents, children (biological or adopted), stepchildren, spouses, siblings, step-siblings, half-siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, first cousins, second cousins, legal guardians of deceased individuals buried on Hart Island; wards of deceased guardians buried on Hart Island; and domestic partners of deceased individuals buried on Hart Island, who wish to visit the gravesites of said deceased individuals.""

On February 19, 2016, the parties agreed to a settlement. The City of New York agreed to provide the plaintiff class with ferry transportation to and from Hart Island, and access to the gravesites of their family members, on at least one weekend day per month. Visitors to the gravesite would be allowed to leave certain sentimental items, like flowers, small stuffed animals, and photographs, at the grave site. The City of New York also agreed to pay the plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs totalling $58,645.00.

In December 2016, the parties met and conferred regarding the settlement and agreed to increase the maximum number of visitors able to visit the gravesites during each visitation period from 25 to 35. The court approved the amended stipulation on January 24, 2017. The court continued to retain jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement agreement until December 1, 2018. The case is now closed. ","['JUDGE BRODERICK\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK ---------------------------------------------------------------x ROSARIA CORTES LUSERO, MARIE CRUZ GARCIA and MICHELLE CANER, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated,\nPlaintiffs, -versusTHE CITY OF NEW YORK,\nDefendant. ---------------------------------------------------------------x\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT 1. Though the City states Hart Island is open to the public, the Department of Correction makes it virtually impossible for anyone even to make it on to the ferry that infrequently travels to the island. She wants to visit the Halt Island grave of her daughter, who died shortly before birth in 1995. Plaintiff MARIE CRUZ GARCIA, the eldest daughter of plaintiff Rosaria Cortes Lusero, is a 26-year old woman who currently resides in New York City. She formerly resided in New York City and continues to visit on a regular basis. Both Ms. Cortes Lusero and Ms. Garcia have been haunted by this loss ever since. Ms. Cortes Lusero forced hospital staffto take a photograph of her dead child shortly after the birth-s-a picture she has kept to this day. No one from the City or the hospital gave Ms. Cortes Lusero further information regarding where exactly her daughter would be buried or how she could visit her child\'s grave.\n13. Mr. Caner eventually moved to New York City around 1995, where he struggled with substance abuse and soon found himself homeless. Ms. Caner understands that she would only be permitted to visit a gazebo at the edge of the island under the Department\'s current policy and believes that such a visit would not bring her closure. And Ms. Caner wants to say goodbye to her father not just in some random place, but where he will rest for etemity. In addition to being inadequate, visits to the gazebo on Hart Island are nearly impossible to obtain. Although the Department of Correction website states that the island is ""open to the public,"" family members who follow the Department\'s instructions to schedule a\n9\n\n\x0cgazebo visit often find their efforts impeded by a number of bureaucratic hurdles, including disconnected phone calls, unretumed messages, and impolite behavior. Furthermore, neither woman encountered or saw imnates during their visits. The defendant\'s actions violate the plaintiffs\' lights under the New York Constitution,\nincluding sections 3, 6, and 8 of Article I. JURISDICTION AND VENUE\n43. See Complaint, Lusero v. City of New York, 14 Civ. The settlement remains in place until December 1, 2018. Should the plaintiffs determine at that time that the City is not providing sufficient access to gravesites on Hart Island, the settlement provides that nothing in the settlement bars them from filing a new case. Moreover, they secured additional and important relief that went beyond what they specifically sought in their complaint (much less could have obtained through litigation): the right to visit specifically on weekends, with a mix of Saturday and Sunday visitation days; the right to bring guests; the right to leave mementos at gravesites; the right to have a reservation system; the right to have the City maintain an up-to-date database of burials on Hart Island; and the right to ongoing reporting by the City about compliance with the terms of the settlement. Each family member may be permitted to be accompanied on their gravesite visit by up to four other individuals (who do not have to be family members of those buried on Hart Island). On each visitation day, the City shall provide ferry service to transport visitors to and from Hart Island.\n3. It is the intention of the parties that the City will seek to accommodate as many visitors as it can, up to the twenty-five visitor limit. If the requestor provides an email address, the online system shall generate an automated confirmation receipt to the requestor confirming the details of the request. There shall be no limit on the number of times a person is permitted to visit.\n8. The City reserves the right to search visitors consistent with its legitimate security concerns. The City may require visitors to surrender electronic devices, which the City shall safeguard until returned to the visitor at the conclusion of the visit.\n12. Visitors shall be permitted to leave the following mementos at gravesites: flowers without vases, small stuffed animals, photographs, prayer cards, small flags, and blankets. The City will continue to maintain a publicly accessible database for members of the public to locate persons buried on Hart Island (either the current Hart Island Lookup Service or another equivalent service). Separate and apart from the gravesite visits specified in this Stipulation and Order, the City shall continue non-gravesite visits to Hart Island on a monthly basis.\n15. In instances where any of these circumstances prevent a visitation day from taking place, the City will make reasonable efforts to promptly notify each requestor scheduled to visit that day, to remedy the situation\n- 5 -\n\n\x0cCCaassee11:1:144-c-cvv-0-099553333-V-VSSBB DDooccuummeennt t2473-1 FFileiledd0027/1/098/1/165 PPaaggee66oof f1100\npromptly, and to reschedule that visitation day as soon as practicable. The parties shall then engage in good-faith efforts to resolve the issue. In any such motion by the plaintiffs based upon the City’s alleged non-compliance, the City shall be considered to be in compliance therewith unless plaintiffs establish that the City’s failures or omissions to meet the terms of this Stipulation and Order were not minimal or isolated, but were substantial.\n21. Plaintiffs shall not use the City’s alleged failure to answer visit requests made by telephone as grounds for modification, enforcement, contempt, or other relief.\n22. Once jurisdiction of the Court ends, nothing in this agreement shall bar the plaintiffs, including any putative class member, from filing suit to seek judicial relief ordering the City to provide gravesite visits.\n23. The parties agree that the plaintiffs are prevailing parties in this matter for purposes of attorneys’ fees and costs. Should those efforts fail, the plaintiffs may file a motion for fees and costs.\n24. By 2/18/2015, the parties shall jointly submit to the Court a proposed case management plan and scheduling order.

CJ-IL-0001,"On January 13, 2006, Illinois parolees who were re-arrested for alleged parole violations filed this class action complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) arguing that they had been unconstitutionally denied a timely parole revocation hearing. For violations of their constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the plaintiffs asked the Court for preliminary and permanent injunctions.  

On May 8, 2006, the court (Judge Robert W. Gettleman) certified a class consisting of individuals held for more than 10 business days without a preliminary parole revocation hearing.  The court also granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.  The court found that the parolees had a constitutional right to a prompt, preliminary parole revocation hearing and a limited constitutional right to confront and cross examine persons who had provided testimony or evidence which could be used to revoke parole. 

On November 2, 2006, the parties reached a settlement and submitted the proposed agreement to the court, which approved the consent decree on January 26, 2007.  The consent decree set specific timelines, notice provisions, and guidelines for inspections for revocation hearings. It prohibited the assignment of any DOC employee or agent from serving as Hearing Officers.  The Court also appointed a monitor to assess progress for one year after entry of the consent decree,  to be paid for his services by the defendant.  On January 23, 2008, the monitor reported that the defendants had achieved substantial compliance with the provisions of the consent decree. The Court approved the final report and discharged the monitor.

In 2012, new lawyers appeared for the plaintiff class, from the Roderick Macarthur Justice Center, at Northwestern University law school, and the Uptown People's Law Center.  On November 30, 2012, the plaintiffs moved for a rule to show cause alleging that the defendants were no longer complying with the consent decree.  On October 30 and 31, 2013, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the allegations.  After the hearing, the parties stated they wanted to resolve the matter via settlement, so the court reserved ruling on the motion to show cause.  The parties did reach a second settlement agreement, and on April 24, 2014, the court approved an amended consent decree.  For one year and 90 days following the entry of the amended consent decree, the plaintiffs' counsel had the opportunity to observe 15 parole hearings.  The parties reserved the determination of attorneys' fees and costs for the Court. 

After proceedings regarding attorneys' fees and costs, the court awarded the plaintiffs $140,000 for attorneys' fees and costs on October 31, 2014.

PlaintilTBrown re-alleges paragraphs 1-30 of Count I as paragraphs 1-30 of Count II. Defendants have established a unified policy that affects all Cook County parolees charged with violations in the same way.\n36. Common issues of law and fact predominate over any minor differences in treatment. Such a report, standing alone, unenhanced by any additional extrinsic factors, does not bear sufficient indicia of reliahility to revoke parole absent confrontation.\n9. If there are, durillg the life of the proposed consent decree, any disagreements between the parties, both sides shall endeavor to address them in good faith to come to resolution without thrther involvement of the court. In conjunction with CCDOC\'s practice of rapidly shipping parolees to NRC2, these facts result in the presence of hundreds of parolees at that site, where they receive a finding of pmbablc cause or no probable cause at a King hearing.\nInmates at both CCDOC and NRC have continued to request continuances with considerable frequency, a phenomenon that we first described in the August 16, 2007 report. The distribution of this responsibility has enabled Jcanetta Cardine to spend more time on her other PRB duties, including arranging program placements for parolees.\nAs described in our previous reports, two or more IDOC Parole Agents are present at all King hearings in their capacities as King investigators. rom Division XI, across the street from the main jail complex.7 As noted in our last report, no requests for attorney participation by phone have been received in recent months.\nHearing Accommodations\nHearings conducted at CCDOC take place in the Receiving Room, located in the basement of Division V. This location has a number of drawbacks and can only be described as minimally adequate. The King Hearing Officer uses a booth normally used for intake screening. Other than those persons participating in the hearings, only a Correctional Officer is present in the room during hearings, for security\nreasons.\nCROWDING AT CCDOC AND INMATE TRANSFERS\nAs the court monitor in Duran v. Sheahan et al., These data provide significant corroboration for the contention that parole warrants are being issued very selectively, in contrast to the practice in years past.\nAlthough IDOC ofticials did agree to provide these reports to CCDOC officials on a regular basis, this has not occurred. No testimony is presented to prove the alleged violations and Cook County parolees never are allowed to present favorable testimony from their witnesses. Gaspar v. l.invatev, 167 F.R.D. 51 (N.D.

Hill and King’s continued incarceration bolster plaintiffs’ claims that parolees’ constitutional rights are compromised by defendants’ policies and practices that disregard Morrissey, and that Gerstein and Morrissey probable cause findings are distinct.\nPlaintiffs also claim that defendants’ policies and practices prevent parolees from receiving sufficient preliminary parole hearings when they are finally held. As a result, parolees cannot make arrangements for witnesses to appear at the remote hearings or otherwise prepare their revocation defense. In the reply in support of the motion for preliminary injunction, plaintiffs seek to require defendants “to submit a plan that provides for a preliminary hearing within 10 business days of arrests” that includes “some provision for witness testimony” at the preliminary hearing, and that defendants be “enjoined from their current practice of relying on agent reports or Gerstein hearings.” 408 U.S. at 482 (reimprisonment strains or severs whatever family and employment ties the parolee has established\n22\n\n\x0cCase: 1:06-cv-00204 Document #: 48 Filed: 05/08/06 Page 23 of 25 PageID #:569\nwhile on parole).

The Hearing Officer does not instruct parolees to submit their own request to the PRB, as set forth in the Notice of Rights. The evidence developed in this case provide compelling evidence that the Defendants are failing to ensure these rights and thus are violating key components of the King Decree.

FINDINGS OF PROBABLE CAUSE ARE BASED UPON THE EVIDENCE AND ARE NOT IMPERMISSIBLY ENTERED AUTOMATICALLY All parties agree that when a court of law finds probable cause that a parolee committed a\ncrime, then the King Hearing Officer can enter an automatic finding of “probable cause” to hold a parolee on the parole violation.

The Consent Decree attempted to remedy the systematic violations of parolees’ rights during preliminary parole revocation hearings—the purpose of which is to determine whether there is probable cause to hold the parolee in custody on the IDOC warrant—by imposing a variety of continuing obligations concerning the procedural rights of parolees in these hearings, both at Cook County and IDOC facilities.1 These obligations fall into two overarching categories.\n7. See Declaration of Rashid Evans ¶ 4; Declaration of Michael Fulgham ¶ 4.

Those facilities included the McPherson Training School in Ocala, the Arthur G.

Paul) on July 7, 1987, set forth agreed reforms to be implemented in the following areas: assessment, evaluation and placement of juveniles; education; attorney client access; and prohibition of isolation.  The Decree also incorporated previous orders that had been entered by the District Court, as follows:

1. provision of access to counsel (order on stipulated motion in 1987);

2. prohibition against hogtying and shackling to fixed objects, and regulating the use of mechanical restraints (orders dated February 1, 1983 and July 14, 1983);

3. closure of McPherson Training School (order dated August 6, 1985);

4. removal of females from training schools (order dated August 6, 1985);

5. removal of all children 13 years of age and under from training schools (order dated August 6, 1985); and

6. removal of all status offenders from training schools (order dated August 6, 1985).

Following entry of the Decree, the case was then administratively closed.  Monitoring of the implementation process continued for years.

On October 29, 1995, the District Court (Judge Maurice M. Paul) terminated the Consent Decree as to the Dozier Training School.  The Decree remained in effect as to the Eckerd Youth Development Center.   Bobby M. v. Chiles, 907 F.Supp. 368 (N.D.Fla. 1995).  On November 6, 1996, portions of the consent decree relating to ECKERD Youth Development Center were also terminated.

Thereafter, the parties litigated the issue of liability for post-judgment attorney fees and related expenses.  On April 1, 1999, the District Court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs for attorneys' fees in the amount of $182,912.19, plus costs in the amount of $10,724.90.  Defendants appealed.  While the case was on appeal, the parties settled the issue of fees and costs.

On May 10, 2000, the District Court (Judge Maurice M. Paul) granted defendants' motion to dismiss the remaining claims and the case was closed.  We have no further information on the case.

Chiles\n\nJI-FL-002-011\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA TALLAHASSEE DIVISION\n\nBOBBY M, et al. , 547) is GRANTED.\nThus, the only issue which remains before this Court is\nwhether the Court should continue to hold this thirteen-year-old\nconsent decree over the heads of the Defendants as a means of\ncompelling the officials in charge to address the fire safety risks\nidentified by the court-appointed expert, or whether the Court\nshould finally put the decree to rest.\nAs the Court pointed out in its Order dated October 30, 1995,\nat the time that this case came before the Court, vicious penal\npractices -- such as hog-tying juvenile detainees -- were employed\nat the facilities. Because the parties have all represented to the Court that substantial compliance has been achieved at Dozier, the Court asserts that it is empowered to terminate the consent decree as to Dozier, thereby dismissing Dozier 370 from the explicit strictures and obligations laid out therein.[2] With this *370 order, the Court exercises its power to terminate the decree.\nIn this federal circuit, questions concerning a district court\'s authority to terminate a consent decree are governed by United States v. City of Miami, 2 F.3d 1497 (11th Cir.1993). Nothing in this order, however, shields the State of Florida or its training school administrators from a continued obligation to conduct themselves in such a way as to ensure that no resident is subjected to unconstitutional treatment.\n[3] Order, January 19, 1995 (doc. communications with family, deprivation of access to courts\n\nJudges: Paul\n\nand attorneys, and lack of aftercare.\n\nOpinion by: MAURICE M.

FH-NH-0001,"On July 19, 2010, the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act of 1988, §42 U.S.C. §§3601-3631 against the owner and manager of a four-unit apartment building in Monroe, New Hampshire. The plaintiff brought the suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, on behalf of a  mixed-national origin and race family, claiming the Defendant engaged in discriminatory housing practices.  The complaint sets out allegations involving ethnic slurs and other bad treatment of the complainant family, including incidents that led to the arrest of the landlord and state court orders against him.  The U.S. sought to enjoin further discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin and asked for compensatory and punitive damages to the complainants.  The complainants intervened in the suit a few months later.  

On April 7, 2011, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire (Judge Landya McCafferty) approved a consent decree.  The decree enjoined the defendant and its employees from making statements with respect to the rental of a dwelling that indicated a preference, limitation or discrimination based on race, color, or national origin; or coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with any tenant's exercised or enjoyed rights.  The defendant was required to get tenants' permission prior to entering units, except to make emergency repairs.  In addition, the defendant agreed to undertake fair housing training of all employees, and a set of recordkeeping and reporting requirements.   Finally, the defendant agreed to pay the complainants $15,000 in compensatory damages.  The consent order was set to last two years, unless the defendant retained any direct or indirect ownership, management, or other financial interest in any residential rental property, in which case the consent order was to remain in effect for three years. 

The consent decree terminated without any further litigation, and the case is now closed.","['Case 1:10-cv-00297 Document 1 Filed 07/19/10 Page 1 of 6\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT DISTRICT OF NEW HAMPSHIRE\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n)\n\n)\n\nPlaintiff,\n\n)\n\n)\n\nv.\n\n)\n\n)\n\nLOTHAR RIBA,\n\n)\n\n)\n\nDefendant.\n\n)\n\n__________________________________ )\n\nCivil No.\n\nCOMPLAINT The United States of America (“United States”) alleges as follows:\nNATURE OF THE ACTION 1.

Defendant Lothar Riba is the owner and manager of a four-unit apartment building at 53 Main Street, Monroe, New Hampshire. Defendant has owned and managed the property since at least 2008.

PB-IL-0006,"On August 22, 2007, individuals with disabilities filed a lawsuit under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Social Security Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Nursing Care Reform Act, against various Illinois state officials in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Plaintiffs, represented by private and public interest counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that they were institutionalized in a nursing facility even though they were capable of living in a more community-integrated setting with appropriate services.  Plaintiffs claimed that Defendants conditioned receipt of long-term care on remaining in an institutionalized setting, even though it would be less expensive for Plaintiffs to receive appropriate care in the community.

The Court (Judge Joan H. Lefkow) certified a class as: ""all Medicaid-eligible adults with disabilities in Cook County, Illinois, who are being, or may in the future be, unnecessarily confined to nursing facilities and who, with appropriate supports and services, may be able to live in a community setting.""  71 Fed.R.Serv.3d 1089.

At a status hearing on January 7, 2011, the parties advised Magistrate Judge Maria Valdez that they could conclude settlement discussions without further assistance from the court.  

On Aug. 29, 2011, the parties jointly moved for the court to approve the consent decree they had agreed upon.  The court held a fairness hearing on Dec. 20, 2011, and ultimately accepted the decree.

The consent decree established benchmarks for moving specific numbers of class members out of nursing facilities and into community-based settings. Over the course of the first two-and-a-half years, the decree compelled the state to move 1,100 class members into the community. It also required the state to provide up to $10 million in housing assistance to support the first group of transitioned adults. The decree also compelled the state to develop services needed to adequately support class members who choose to live in the community. It established a monitor to ensure compliance with the decree, and granted $1.2 million in attorneys' fees. 

The court approved an updated plan following the parties' cross-motion to enter into a cost-neutral plan and supplement and amend the December 2011 consent decree on November 16, 2016. The plan included the transition of class members into community-based settings, and continued evaluations and service plans for the class members. The court retained jurisdiction to oversee the full implementation of the plan. The court approved an updated plan on April 5, 2018. Monitoring by the court appointed monitor (Gail P. Hutchings) is ongoing as of May 20, 2020.","Lenil Colbert is identified as a 35 year old man who has seizures, is partially\n\nparalyzed and uses a wheelchair.

ATTORNEYS\' FEES AND COSTS ................................................................................ 25 XII. Plaintiffs allege that Defendants have denied them the opportunity to live in appropriate integrated settings where they could lead more independent and more productive lives in their own communities. Plaintiffs seek injunctive relief requiring that Defendants (1) inform Plaintiffs as to their eligibility for Community-Based Services and their choice of such services; (2) provide comprehensive evaluations to determine the eligibility of Plaintiffs for CommunityBased Services, both prior to and after admission to Nursing Facilities; and (3) provide, as appropriate, Plaintiffs with services and supports in the Community-Based Setting and refrain from providing services only in institutional settings. Therefore, upon all of the foregoing, and the Court being otherwise fully advised, the Court hereby ORDERS, ADJUDGES and DECREES as follows:\nDECREE\nCapitalized terms set forth herein are defined in Section IV, ""Definition of Terms."" The Cost Neutral Plan must include agreed upon time periods during which Defendants will transition Class Members to Community-Based Settings such that, based on the criteria described herein and set forth in more detail in the plan, the transitions of Class Members cost the same or less to the State in the aggregate as if those Class Members instead had remained in Nursing Facilities. For Class Members with Mental Illness, ""Person Centered"" means a process based on a model of recovery. In the event the Monitor finds Defendants not in compliance with the Decree, the Monitor shall promptly meet and confer with the Parties in an effort to agree on steps necessary to achieve compliance.

IM-MD-0013,"On November 21, 2019, three refugee resettlement agencies filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenging the Trump Administration's recent Executive Order, ""Enhancing State and Local Involvement in Refugee Resettlement."" The agencies (HIAS, Inc., Church World Service, Inc., and Lutheran Immigration & Refugee Service, Inc.), represented by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), sued President Trump, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs alleged that the President’s September 26, 2019, Executive Order violated the Refugee Act of 1980, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.), and principles of federalism. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction to enjoin enforcement of the Order. The case was assigned to Judge Peter J. Messitte.

The plaintiffs alleged that Executive Order 13888 made an unprecedented change to the refugee resettlement process by mandating that refugees not be resettled in the United States unless the state and locality where they are to be resettled take the affirmative step of providing written consent. As national refugee resettlement agencies, the plaintiffs were then charged by the federal government with the responsibility of soliciting and obtaining written consent from all states and localities where refugees they assist could be resettled. The plaintiffs claimed that such a change would provide individual states and local governments with effective veto power over refugee resettlement. 

The plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction on November 22, 2019. Judge Messitte granted the plaintiffs’ motion on January 15. 2020 WL 218646. Judge Messitte concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, that they faced irreparable harm, and that the Executive Order was not in the public interest. Consequently, he issued a nationwide injunction enjoining the Executive Order.

The government appealed the injunction to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 12, 2020 (Do. 20-1160), and Judge Messitte stayed the proceedings in the district court pending resolution of that appeal on February 14, 2020. 

On January 8, 2021, Circuit Judge Barbara Milano Keenan upheld the preliminary injunction. 985 F.3d 309. The court held that the plaintiffs demonstrated that they were likely to succeed on their claim that the order and notice violated the Refugee Act. The court also determined that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction because the refugee resettlement programs were, by their nature. located throughout the country.

Plaintiff HIAS resides in the Southern Division of this District. CWS is one of the nine national refugee resettlement agencies that has an agreement with the State Department to assist with the initial placement and resettlement of refugees. Within the United States, CWS works to build welcoming communities that support refugees on a path toward self-sufficiency, full integration, and securing a bright future for their families. Since its founding in 1939, LIRS has supported, equipped, and empowered more than half a million refugees resettling in the United States. He is sued in his official capacity.\nFACTUAL ALLEGATIONS Background on the Refugee Act and U.S. Refugee Resettlement The Refugee Act 19. See, e.g., 8 U.S.C. §§ 1522(a)(2)(C)(iii)(I)-(IV), 1522(a)(2)(A).\n30. The State Department, through its cooperating agencies around the world, is responsible for facilitating the overall refugee application process, while the Department of Homeland Security has responsibility for determining an applicant’s eligibility for refugee status under U.S. law.\n38. After the refugees arrive, staff help with transportation and facilitate conversation while the refugees learn English. Part of the sponsorship assurance process involves determining where in the United States a refugee will be resettled. These decisions take considerable time and care and require weighing multiple factors. Federal Funding for Refugee Assistance 54.

Ala. 2016) (granting Federal Government’s motion to dismiss where Governor of Alabama directed all Alabama agencies “to utilize all lawful means to prevent resettlement of Syrian refugees in the State of Alabama”): Texas Health and Human Services Commission v.

There is no imminent harm to the Government if it is simply required to keep on doing what it has been doing for decades. Driesen, supra, at 1045; see also Panama Ref. See, e.g., INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, 953, n. 16, 103 S.Ct. Yet, Plaintiffs submit, Defendants do not contend there was no record at the time of promulgation; they deem it irrelevant and simply decline to disclose it. 36, p. 10, if a State consents to resettlement, but a county (or city) objects, allowing the localities to veto resettlement in their jurisdictions would appear to interfere with the sovereign prerogative of the State to set statewide policy.\n22 Plaintiffs also raise a not implausible concern over whether their solicitation of written consents from State and Local Governments might constitute lobbying activities affecting their status or tax-exempt 501(c)(3) status.

The Department of State contracts with nine of these agencies to provide resettlement services to refugees, including assistance with obtaining employment, English-language services, medical care, and housing. § In the plaintiffs’ view, by transforming the consultation process described in the Act into an “opt-in” system, the Order and Notice grant states and localities more authority over resettlement decisions than Congress intended. The government contends that the Order and Notice do not require the consent of states and localities as a precondition to the resettlement of refugees, but merely call for this information to be provided as one factor that the Secretary of State (the Secretary) considers when determining where individuals will be placed. Credit Union, 972 F.3d at 357 (citation omitted); see also Sierra Club v. U.S. Dep’t of Interior, 899 F.3d 260, 291 (4th Cir. 8 U.S.C. § 1522(a)(1)(B)(iii) (emphasis added). The Act also requires that the Secretary5 “consult regularly (not less *320 often than quarterly) with State and local governments and private nonprofit voluntary agencies concerning the sponsorship process and the intended distribution of refugees among the States and localities\n6\n\n\x0cHias, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309 (2021)\nbefore their placement in those states and localities.” § 1522(a)(1)(B)(iii).6 Use of the term “cooperation” together with the term “consultation” strongly suggests that Congress intended for the consultation requirement to involve a dialogue facilitating an exchange of opinions among the affected parties.\nThe terms of the Order, however, do not require states and localities, before withholding consent, to engage in any deliberation with other interested parties. This license to ignore the statutory criteria plainly is at odds with the careful sequencing process established by Congress.\nSuch potential disregard of the statutory criteria by states and localities is not a mere technicality but could undermine substantially the national resettlement program created by Congress. Such resettlement migration in disregard of the statutory criteria will place increased stress on the non-consenting jurisdiction’s resettlement infrastructure that otherwise could have been avoided.\n8\n\n\x0cHias, Inc. v. Trump, 985 F.3d 309 (2021)\nIn addition to shifting significant decision-making authority away from the Secretary, the Order also conflicts with the Refugee Act’s allocation of responsibility between states and localities. If the Secretary of State intends to provide for the resettlement of refugees in a State or locality that has not provided consent, then the Secretary *325 shall notify the President of such decision, along with the reasons for the decision, before proceeding.\nOrder § 2(b) (emphasis added).\nWhile the savings clause offers a theoretical opportunity for the Secretary to override the consent requirement, the exception stated in the savings clause is merely that – theoretical. Kouambo v. Barr, 943 F.3d 205, 213 (4th Cir. Id. at 232-33.\nWe conclude that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction.

Trump, 985 F.3d 309 (2021) be resettled in the state at all.\n11 We disagree with the government’s assertion at oral argument that the consent of the states and localities is just one factor the Secretary would consider when making resettlement decisions.",0.7207,0.1798,0.2879,0.2588,0.0645,0.1032,0.3474,0.0867,0.1388
PN-CA-0030,"On October 28, 2008, an African-American man filed this class-action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Oakland, California Police Department and one of its officers. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, requested injunctive relief and monetary damages, alleging that the City unlawfully targeted citizens on the basis of race, violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that officers of the police department had issued warrants based on intentionally false or misleading information, subjecting him to unreasonable search and seizure, arresting him without probable cause, and maliciously prosecuting him.  On October 6, 2008, the charges against the plaintiff were dismissed when the Alameda County District Attorney's Office discovered that the warrant had been illegally obtained. Although the charges were dismissed, the plaintiff alleged that as a result of the unreasonable search and seizure, he was unable to work causing a loss of income and suffered damages for pain and emotional distress. 

On February 9, 2009, a second amended complaint was filed. This complaint added plaintiffs, including African American and Hispanic men and women, who were allegedly subjected to unreasonable search and seizure stemming from illegally obtained warrants and many of whom had been subsequently arrested.  

On August 5, 2010, the plaintiffs submitted a stipulated motion for approval of settlement. The United States District Court Northern District of California (Judge Thelton E. Henderson) granted the motion where the City offered to settle the monetary relief claims of the 104 individual plaintiffs and putative class members for total gross settlement sum of $6,500.00 inclusive of all attorney fees and costs. After reaching this agreement, the parties continued with settlement discussions on non-monetary relief claims. Their discussions focused on specific reforms intended to remedy the kind of police misconduct that occurred in this case that would be of substantial benefit to the putative class. 

On February 14, 2011, the parties reached a non-monetary settlement agreement. The settlement set out specific procedures for the Oakland Police Department to obtain affidavits and warrants. The parties also agreed to set of protocols for drug evidence testing. The Court retained jurisdiction for two years from the settlement date so that the parties could petition for redress pertaining to compliance with their agreement. 

There is nothing substantive in the docket sheet following settlement.  Presumably the matter is closed.  ","This action arises under 42 U.S.C. Sections 1983. The plaintiff was thereafter imprisoned in jail 21\nwithout reasonable or probable cause until he was able to post bail.

IM-DC-0065,"On August 17, 2018, 29 parents who were forcibly separated from their children by the federal government filed this lawsuit in U.S. District Court of District Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Justice for violating the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 <i>et seq.</i>), the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 701), the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 <i>et seq.</i>), and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Plaintiffs, represented by Muslim Advocates as well as the Legal Aid Justice Center and the law firm of Eversheds & Sunderland, LLP, sought an order compelling the defendants to vacate the results of credible fear interviews, which had found them eligible for removal, as well as the resulting orders of removal. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and new credible fear interviews. 

Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that under DOJ policy, parents were forced to undergo credible fear interviews while they were suffering from emotional and psychological trauma from being separated from their children. Credible fear interviews determine whether an asylum seeker faces a credible fear of persecution or torture when returned to their home country. Unable to articulate their experiences due to trauma, the plaintiffs received negative credible fear determinations and faced immediate deportation. 

This case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman. 

On August 17, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to proceed under pseudonyms and a redacted complaint. The defendant filed a motion to extend time to file an answer on October 22, 2018. On December 31, 2018, the defendant again filed such a motion.

Along with two related cases, MMM v. Sessions and Ms. L v. ICE, this case settled. On November 15, 2018, Judge Dana M. Sabraw (the judge assigned in Ms. L. v. ICE) issued a final approval of the settlement. According to this settlement, the government committed to conducting a good faith review of the plaintiff’s prior credible fear findings to determine if reconsideration would be appropriate. However, the government refused to return any parent who had already been deported.  

On February 5, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. This case is now closed, but the court in Ms. L v. ICE retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement.

( 1 (In this document, references to Ms. L class members encompass Dora plaintiffs.) Class counsel are responsible for determining a class member’s intentions related to waiver of the procedures set forth below. The Court will retain jurisdiction to enforce the provisions of this plan, which represents the substantive terms for the implementation of a settlement agreement and supersedes the prior written or oral communications between the parties regarding this plan.\n1. If a Ms. L class member or M.M.M. agreed class member was released from DHS or ORR custody, is not currently in Section 240 removal proceedings, and is not subject to a final removal order, that individual can affirmatively apply for asylum before U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), USCIS will adjudicate such an application regardless of whether an unfiled NTA exists, and USCIS will follow its established procedures concerning a parent’s involvement in his or her minor child’s asylum application process. Where such a class member child asserts, or has already asserted, an intention to apply for asylum or a fear of persecution or torture, either directly or through counsel, they shall be referred to USCIS for a credible fear determination.\nc. In determining whether any factual inconsistencies between the original interview and the subsequent fact-gathering impact the credibility of the parent, due consideration will be given to the psychological state of the parent at the time of the initial interview. If the parent’s credible fear determination remains negative, USCIS will screen the child individually for credible fear. The credible fear claim will then be considered under the standards of 8 C.F.R. § 208.30, as described above. In determining whether any factual inconsistencies between the original interview and the subsequent fact-\n2 This agreement does not impact the ability of Ms. L class members with reinstated orders of removal who are not detained to pursue any available appeal of such an order under existing law and subject to statutory time periods.\n3\n\n\x0cCase 3:18-cv-00428-DMS-MDD Document 220-1 Filed 09/12/18 PageID.3442 Page 4 of 7\ngathering impact the credibility of the parent, due consideration will be given to the psychological state of the parent at the time of the initial interview. If the parent establishes that he or she can meet the reasonable fear standard, as it is described at 8 C.F.R. § 208.31(c), then DHS will place the parent in withholding-only proceedings. If the child receives a separate negative credible fear determination, the child may seek review by an immigration judge.\ng. The notice and time periods described in this paragraph will not apply if a parent affirmatively requests, in writing, that the review or interview take place on an expedited basis.\n2. In the case of a parent and child(ren) both in ER proceedings under the process described above, if either the parent or the child establishes a credible fear of persecution or torture, USCIS will issue NTAs to both parent and child and place the family in Section 240 removal proceedings. See 8 C.F.R. §§ 208.30(f) (positive credible fear finding made by USCIS), 1208.30(g)(2)(iv)(B) (positive credible fear finding made by immigration judge).\n3. Plaintiffs concede, however, that removal of any Ms. L class member with a reinstated removal order under this agreement is significantly likely to occur in the reasonably foreseeable future and that, if a parent initiates legal proceedings challenging their continued detention, DHS may immediately proceed with that Ms. L class member’s removal, regardless of any injunctive orders issued in Ms. L and M.M.M., provided that DHS gives the parent at least 7 days’ advance notice to the parent that he or she will be removed.\n5. The parent would be permitted to participate in the child(ren)’s credible fear interview and provide testimony on behalf of the child(ren), in addition to any testimony from the child(ren). Counsel for the child will be permitted to attend the interview in person, so long as it does not unreasonably delay the process and any attorney assistance is at no expense to the government, and the timing of the interview will be in accordance with Paragraph 1.g. If the child does not establish credible fear of persecution or torture, the removal orders may immediately be executed.\n7. L counsel, M.M.M. counsel, and Dora counsel will promptly develop a process for obtaining and documenting such a choice through a knowing and voluntary waiver. The classes agree not to pursue any right or claim of removed parents to return to the United States other than as specifically set forth in this paragraph. Plaintiffs’ counsel represent that they believe that such individual cases will be rare and unusual and that they have no basis for believing that such individual cases will be other than rare and unusual. Plaintiffs’ counsel agree to present any such cases, including all evidence they would like considered by the government within 30 days of the approval of this agreement. In light of plaintiffs’ counsel’s representation that such cases will be rare and unusual, Defendants agree to provide a reply to any case presented by Plaintiffs within 30 days of receiving Plaintiffs’ request to consider the case.

EE-NM-0037,"In September 2004, the Albuquerque Area Office of the EEOC (with the participation from the Phoenix District Office) brought this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Mexico against Smith's Food and Drug Centers, Inc., d/b/a PriceRite.  The EEOC's complaint alleged that PriceRite violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating on the basis of sex.  In particular, the complaint alleged that a PriceRite manager made unwanted sexual comments to the charging party, a female employee, and that he inappropriately touched her creating a hostile work environment.  

In November 2004, the charging party and her husband filed a separate action in New Mexico State Court alleging violation of the New Mexico Human Rights Act.  In December 2004, this action was removed to federal court and consolidated with the EEOC's case.  In January 2005, the charging party and her husband filed a motion for remand which was granted in April 2005.  In May 2005, the parties settled all their claims through a two-year consent degree, containing both non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses. 

The decree required PriceRite to: provide the charging party with a neutral reference, distribute their anti-discrimination policies to employees, designate a special investigations officer to investigate discrimination complaints, provide annual EEOC-approved Title VII managerial training, and pay the charging party a sum of $75,000.

The decree was entered in 2005 and scheduled to last 2007.

JC-WI-0009,"On March 14, 2017, a female prisoner who was forced to receive prenatal care, give birth, and undergo post-partum treatment while shackled, filed a putative class-action complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin. The plaintiff sued the County of Milwaukee under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, sought compensatory damages and attorneys’ fees. The plaintiff alleged that in being shackled in accordance with the Milwaukee County Jail’s (MCJ) policy, her Fourteenth Amendment right to due process had been violated.  

The case was originally assigned to Magistrate Judge David E. Jones. Due to non-consent to jurisdiction on the part of the plaintiff, however, the case was reassigned to Judge Lynn Adelman. On April 11, 2017, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that contained minor rewordings of the factual allegations without significantly altering the claims for relief.

On October 17, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion to certify class. The proposed class definition included “All persons who, while incarcerated by Milwaukee County Jail, were hospitalized for labor, delivery, or to receive post-partum treatment at any time from February 1, 2010-present.” This definition differed from the one originally proposed in the complaint in that it did not include “prenatal” care. Judge Adelman denied this motion on May 23, 2018. 

Litigation continued after the order denying class certification until April 8, 2019, when the parties informed the court that they had reached a private settlement agreement. The contents of this agreement was not made public. The plaintiff stipulated to dismissal on June 18, 2019. This case is now closed.

Plaintiff, Melissa Hall, is 27 years old. From February-August 2013, she was an inmate at the Milwaukee County Jail. During her incarceration, Plaintiff was pregnant. She received prenatal and post-partum care and was hospitalized for childbirth and delivery. Defendant David A. Clarke, Jr. is the Sheriff of Milwaukee County. By law, custom, and/or delegation, he has policymaking authority over the jail for the actions at issue in this case. He is responsible for ensuring that the policies and practices of the MCJ comply with federal and state requirements for the treatment of detainees. He has had personal knowledge that the shackling practices challenged in this case were occurring at the jail. The County of Milwaukee is a Wisconsin municipal corporation with its principal place of business in Milwaukee, Wisconsin.\nFacts 7. For example, when Plaintiff was hospitalized for childbirth and left her hospital bed to go to the bathroom, she was made to wear a “belly-chain” around her waist with her wrists attached to the waist and her legs attached to one another by leg-irons.\n9. During her labor and delivery, Plaintiff’s medical providers asked to have the shackles removed and the deputies refused.\n10. As a result of the shackling, medical professionals had difficulty administering an epidural to Plaintiff. Alternatively, it is excessive in relation to any legitimate purpose it allegedly serves.\n12. The policy includes no provisions for individualized evaluations of each pregnant inmate. Special emphasis was placed on the use of the least restrictive constraints “to ensure safety and security. On information and belief, there are at least 40 prospective class members. The questions of law and fact common to the Class predominate over any individual issues. 895.46, requires public entities to pay any tort judgment for damages for which employees are liable within the scope of their employment activities. Plaintiff seeks to represent a class consisting of the following people: All persons who, while incarcerated by Milwaukee County Jail, were shackled during prenatal care, labor, delivery, or post-partum treatment at any time from February 1, 2010-present. The misconduct described above was undertaken pursuant to the policy and practice of the Milwaukee County Jail in that:\nAs a matter of both policy and practice, the Milwaukee County Jail directly encourages, and therefore is the moving force behind, the very type of misconduct at issue here—shackling women during prenatal and post-partum care as well as during labor and delivery.\nCount I - 42 U.S.C. § 1983 Due Process – 14th Amendment\n(Class Claim) 30. Defendants County and Sheriff Clarke used unreasonable force against Plaintiff and the members of the Class because of the shackling policy. Hall proposes to represent a class of all\n\nwomen who were confined in the jail while the policy was in force and who were\n\n1 When the plaintiff filed this case, the Sheriff of Milwaukee County was David A. Clarke, Jr. The plaintiff named Clarke, in his official capacity, as a defendant. The policy made no exception for pregnant inmates who were hospitalized for childbirth. At the hospital, she was restrained with leg irons, wrist restraints, and a belly chain. The four express requirements are: (1) the class is so numerous that joinder of all members is impracticable; (2) there are questions of law or fact common to the class; (3) the claim of the named plaintiff is typical of the claims of the class members; and (4) the plaintiff will fairly and adequately protect the interests of the class. It requires that the class “be defined clearly” and that its membership be determined “by objective criteria rather than by, for example, a class member's state of mind.” See May v. Sheahan, 226 F.3d 876, 884 (7th Cir. Instead, I assume without deciding that the plaintiff and the potential class members were all pretrial detainees.\n4\n\n\x0cperson does not outweigh the inmate’s interest in being free from the restraints, then applying the restraints will violate the inmate’s constitutional rights.\nFor the plaintiff to prevail on her claim, then, she must show that the jail did not have sufficient reason to believe that she would attempt to escape or to harm herself or others if she was not shackled during childbirth. To be sure, if the court agreed with the plaintiff and found that there could never be an adequate justification for shackling an inmate during childbirth, then the plaintiff will have established that every class member was unlawfully shackled, and this would go a long way towards resolving the claims of the entire class. However, no potential class member’s rights were violated by the mere existence of the policy or by the mere fact that the sheriff did not perform an individualized assessment before deciding to restrain her. Thus, the plaintiff and the other women who were injured by the sheriff’s policy may wish to consider pursuing joinder under Rule 20 or consolidation under Rule 42.\nIII.",0.7745,0.1718,0.2812,0.2956,0.0654,0.1071,0.3636,0.0806,0.132
IM-FL-0028,"On December 3, 2018, a U.S. citizen detainee filed this lawsuit under § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to challenge his unlawful arrest and detention by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. The plaintiff alleged that the Sheriff's Office carelessly and aggressively arrested him for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) between the two agencies, in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and his right to be free from false imprisonment under Florida law. The BOA scheme provided the Sheriff with $50 per arrest for detaining individuals arrested for ICE. The plaintiff claimed that despite his repeated protests to multiple jail officers and his offer to produce proof of his U.S. citizenship, the Sheriff’s Office held him so that ICE could deport him to Jamaica. The plaintiff would have been deported to Jamaica but-for a last-minute intervention in which a friend sent a copy of the plaintiff's birth certificate to an ICE agent. The plaintiff sought declaratory and compensatory damages, as well as attorney’s fees. Chief Judge K. Michael Moore was assigned to the case, but was reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.

On February 11, 2019, Judge Williams set a jury trial on February 3, 2020. In the meantime, the parties engaged in negotiations with a mediator. Ultimately, the parties failed to reach a settlement agreement. The trial date was reset for July 20, 2020, and discovery continued.

On February 18, 2020, both the plaintiff and defendants filed for summary judgment. The case was stayed for a few months in mid-2020, in part due to interruptions caused by COVID-19. In the ensuing months, the parties jointly asked for multiple stays for trial proceedings. 

Currently, the parties are supposed to file their motions in limine by May 17, 2021 and their pretrial stipulation and deposition designations by June 7, 2021.

The Parties shall adhere to the schedule as set forth in the Motion. In April 2018, the Sheriff’s Office illegally detained him in response to a request from ICE. Despite his repeated protests to multiple jail officers, his offer to produce proof, and the jail’s own records, the Sheriff’s Office held Mr. Brown so that ICE could deport him to Jamaica—a country where he has never lived and knows no one. Instead, the Sheriff’s Office’s policy and practice is to effectuate every detainer request it receives from ICE, no matter what other information about the person it may receive. Hufford v. Rodgers, 912 F.2d 1338, 1341 (11th Cir.

JC-NM-0003,"On January 12, 2005, a group of pre-arraignment detainees filed this class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for New Mexico, challenging the strip search policy in effect at the Santa Fe County Detention Facility.  The policy at issue required that all persons to be housed in the Detention Center be strip searched for weapons and contraband, regardless of the offense charged and whether or not there was individualized reasonable suspicion that the search would lead to the discovery of contraband or weapons. Plaintiffs maintained that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.  They sought monetary damages and injunctive relief. Management & Training Corporation (the company that was contracted to operated the Detention Center), the Santa Fe County Board of Commissioners and Santa Fe County Sheriffs were named as defendants.

From January 2005 through November 2005, the parties engaged in extensive discovery, including document production, numerous depositions, inspection of the Detention Center and analysis of over 31,000 individual booking records.  Settlement talks began in 2005 and included a six day mediation session before retired District Court Judge Raul A. Ramirez of California.  Negotiations continued until a deal was reached in June 2006.

On July 24, 2006, the District Court (District Judge Bruce D. Black) preliminarily approved the Stipulation of Settlement and certified the case as a class action.

Following a fairness hearing, the District Court entered its final order approving the settlement and closing the case on December 8, 2006.  Under the terms of the settlement, defendants agreed to pay $8.5 million into a settlement fund.  Up to $5,529,750.00, plus interest earned on the settlement fund, would be allocated to pay verified claims.  If the total amount of verified claims exceeded that amount, the amount payable to each member for each claim would be proportionately reduced.  If the total amount of verified claims was less than that amount, the balance would be refunded to the defendants. $2 million was allocated for attorneys' fees and costs, and $470,250.00 was allocated equally among the class representatives. Up to $500,000 was to be paid for claims administration costs, with restrictions to come into play if administration expenses incurred were more or less than that amount.

FACTUAL BACKGROUND RELEVANT TO FINAL APPROVAL A. History of This Litigation The Action was filed on January 12, 2005. Not one objection was received by any Class members. The incentive payments are similarly supported by the law and facts. In addition, Class Counsel undertook extensive outreach efforts in an effort to locate potential Class Members and inform them of the settlement and the procedure for filing claims. 1994); see also Rosenbaum v. MacAllister, 64 F.3d 1439, 1445 (10th Cir. 2d 1091, 1108 (D.N.M. 1999).\nAfter reviewing criticisms of the lodestar method and the findings of the Third Circuit Task Force, the Eleventh Circuit announced that the percentage of the fund, as opposed to the lodestar, would apply to all common fund cases. AWARDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND MANAGING FEE LITIGATION 65 (noting that the percentage method “ensure[s] that the fee award will simulate the marketplace, since most common fund cases are the kinds of cases normally taken on a contingency fee basis, with counsel promised a percentage of any recovery”).\nThe percentage of the fund method is an appropriate method for determining reasonable fees even in the settlement of class actions involving fee-shifting statutes. See e.g., Staton v. Boeing Co., 327 F.3d 938, 967-68 (9th Cir. 1995) (awarding 33% of the common fund as attorneys fees due to the complexity of the issues and the risks); Cullen v. Whitman Medical Corp., 197 F.R.D. 136, 150 (E. D. Pa. 2000) (awarding fees of 33.33% as consistent with other recent cases awarding the same or more from the common fund); Uselton v.\n11\n\n\x0cCommercial Lovelace Motor Freight, Inc., 9 F.3d 849, 853 (10th Cir. 1993)\n\n($507,500 fee, representing 29% of fund);\n\n$\n\nIn re Public Service Company of New Mexico, 1992 WL 278452 (S.D. Cal. 01/25/02) ($2.66 million fee, representing 25% of fund).\n\nC. Twenty-one percent is consistent with the market rate as reflected by the contingent fee agreements negotiated with the Plaintiffs\n\nAs the authorities cited above demonstrate, the agreed-upon fee of 20.6% of the common\n\nfund is at the lowest end of the percentage recoveries routinely approved by federal and state\n\ncourt judges in New Mexico and across the nation. They made personal sacrifices in order to pursue this case on behalf of the Class. 10.\nIn sum, given the circumstances presented in this case and the work performed by the Class Representatives on behalf of the class, the requested incentive award of $42,750 for each Class Representative is reasonable and should be approved.\n26\n\n\x0cV. THE ABSENCE OF OBJECTIONS SUPPORTS THE REASONABLENESS OF THE AGREED-UPON ALLOCATION\nNotices of the settlement were sent by first class mail to over 19,000 potential class members, informing them of the details of the Settlement Agreement, including the proposed allocation of attorneys fees, costs and incentive payments.

JC-CO-0003,"On July 25, 2007, the parents of a young woman arrested for driving while under the influence of alcohol filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the County and City of Denver against the City and County of Denver, Colorado, Denver Department of Health and Hospitals. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel asked the court for declaratory relief, economic losses. compensatory and consequential damages, and punitive damages claiming under Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the defendants failed to provide medical care and treatments as well as failure to properly train and supervise.

On the morning of February 18, 2006, Emily Rice was involved in a non-fatal car collision in which her car was destroyed and she suffered life-threatening injuries. After being transported by paramedics to the local hospital Denver Health, operated by the Defendant, she complained of shoulder and abdomen pain. She was booked at the Denver Health as a detainee. The only test performed on Rice was a breathalyzer to determine her blood alcohol which was determined to be .12. Rice was given ibuprofen and then released to the Denver Sheriffs for detention at the Denver County Jail. She was placed in an isolation cell for several hours. Rice continued to complain and was briefly seen by a nurse who told Rice to sleep the pain off. Rice fainted during the intake process. She was not treated by the jail nurse. The Denver Jail staff pulled Rice to her feet and continued the intake process. Rice began to complain of numbness in her feet which had turned cold and grey. The jail doctor was informed of Rice's condition and diagnosed her with drunkenness for which she needed to get sleep. Throughout the night Rice and other inmates yelled for help for which there was no reply from the guards. Eventually Rice complained of numbness is her legs and that was unable to move them. The on-staff nurse was informed of Rice's condition; she never visited to Rice to treat her. Approximately 24-hours after Rice's car collision, she died in her jail cell. The official medical report stated that the cause of death was a ruptured spleen. 

On December 2, 2008, settlement was reached for a non-disclosed amount. Media reports stated the amount was approximately $4 million. On December 17, 2008, Judge Marcia Krieger dismissed the case in light of the settlement. ","E-mail:\n\nDarold W, Killmer #16056\n\nMali Newman # 192\n\nSara J.

Plaintiffs hereby incorporate all other paragraphs of this Amended Complaint as if fully set forth herein. Defendants are persons under Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The Supervisory Jail Defendants’ failure to properly train and supervise their subordinate employees was the moving force and proximate cause of the violation of Ms. Rice’s constitutional rights. Defendants’ conduct as described herein, in preventing Plaintiff Susan Garber from seeing Emily Rice at the jail and in intentionally engaging in the conduct that led to the death of Emily Rice, deprived Plaintiffs Susan Garber and Roy Rice of their liberty interest in their intimate association with Emily Rice, their daughter, as protected under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. Ms. Rice complained to a guard that she was feeling very bad and was finally, briefly allowed to speak with a nurse.... [The nurse] performed no medical evaluation of Ms. Rice. Instead, without ever looking at the patient, [the nurse] arrived at her diagnosis and remedy: Ms. Rice was still drunk and needed to drink plenty of fluids and sleep it off. Id.

IM-DC-0083,"This lawsuit was filed on July 24, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The suit was brought by the Texas Civil Rights Project as next friend for one hundred unaccompanied migrant children who had been arrested by Customs and Border Protection. The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union Immigration Rights Project, the ACLU Foundation of Texas, Oxfam America, the Center for Gender and Refugees Studies, and the ACLU of D.C.. They sued the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, Chief of U.S. Border Patrol Rodney Scott, Director of Immigration Customs and Enforcement Matthew Albence, Secretary of HHS Alex Azar, and CDC Director Robert Redfield. The complaint contended that the federal government had implemented a new process of removing immigrant children without providing for adequate protections, especially by holding those children away from their families or other sponsors and by not providing counsel. This process was instituted over a series of regulations, orders, and agency memos that the complaint calls the ""Title 42 Process."" The complaint argued that this Title 42 Process violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), and that agencies exceed the power granted to them under the Immigration and Naturalization Act. They requested declaratory relief and injunctive relief that would prohibit the defendants from enforcing the Title 42 Process, stay their removal, grant them counsel, and grant the children TVPRA protections.

The case was assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell. 

A few weeks later, on August 6, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case, even before defendants responded -- they did not give an explanation as to why they dismissed the case. In a minute order on August 10, Judge Howell dismissed the case without prejudice and closed the case.","Entered: 07/24/2020)\n\nNOTICE of Statement Regarding Other Pending Cases by TEXAS\n\n3\n\nCIVIL RIGHTS PROJECT (Perez, Celso) (Entered: 07/24/2020)\n\n4 NOTICE OF WITHDRAWAL OF MOTION by TEXAS CIVIL\n\n07/27/2020 07/27/2020\n07/27/2020 07/28/2020\n\nRIGHTS PROJECT re 2 MOTION for Temporary Restraining Order (Perez, Celso) (Entered: 07/26/2020)\n\nCase Assigned to Chief Judge Beryl A.

This case challenges the government’s unprecedented new system for restricting immigration along the Canadian and Mexican borders in the name of public health and under the purported authority of 42 U.S.C. § 265. Among other things, the Title 42 Process authorizes the summary expulsion of unaccompanied minors without any procedural protections—even if the child shows no signs of having COVID-19, and even if the child is fleeing danger and seeking protection in the United States. But those public health provisions do not authorize this unprecedented Title 42 Immigration Process. But children and others seeking protection may under no circumstances be deported without a hearing to determine their right to remain in the United States (even if that means a period of quarantine is required). Instead, unaccompanied minors like the children at issue here are regularly being held at hotels for multiple days as Defendants arrange for their deportation. On information and belief, their deportation is imminent. As an essential part of this mission, TCRP has been dedicated to defending the rights of immigrant communities for nearly 30 years, including serving the legal needs of unaccompanied children and asylum seekers in the McAllen area and across the state of Texas. For example, TCRP has recently represented seven children subject to the Title 42 Process, who are both in and outside the United States. ICE is the sub-agency of DHS that is responsible for carrying out removal orders and overseeing immigration detention. Every day, unaccompanied children flee persecution and danger in their home countries and journey to the United States seeking safety. Children from Canada and Mexico are subject to an initial screening to determine whether they must be referred to ORR custody. 8 U.S.C. § 1232(a)(2)(A)(i)-(iii), (a)(3). Children cannot be removed via fast-track removal processes applicable to others. To qualify for asylum, a noncitizen must show a “well-founded fear of persecution” on account of a protected ground. Such noncitizens may only be detained\n11\n\n\x0cCase 1:20-cv-02035 Document 1 Filed 07/24/20 Page 14 of 34\n“for a sufficient time to . . . 17,060-17088 (Mar. 26, 2020) (effective date Mar. 20, 2020). 22,424 (Apr. 22, 2020) (effective date Apr. 20, 2020). The CDC acknowledged that there were alternatives to expulsion but concluded that it was not worth the resources for those, like children and asylum seekers, who lacked documents. To determine whether a noncitizen is “subject to the CDC Order,” the CBP Memo instructs officers to use “experience” and “physical observation” to determine whether they “believe[] that it is more likely than not” that the person whom they encounter in “[e]nforcement efforts on the SWB [southwestern border] and NB [northern border],” anywhere “within the area of operation of a Border Patrol station or POE operated by CBP,” is “seeking to enter” without proper travel documents at or between POEs. On June 25, 2020, Defendant Mark Morgan, Acting Commissioner of CBP, testified before Congress that over 2,000 unaccompanied children have been deported under the Title 42 Process. As of mid-June, ORR had less than 975 children, a 72% decline from the number of children in custody in late March. CDC, however, offered no evidence of this causal link. A 5-year-old was recently detained for 19 days at the McAllen Hampton Inn & Suites. On information and belief, the Unnamed Children do not currently have other legal representation. All of the Unnamed Children are entitled to the special procedure and protections available to unaccompanied minors under the immigration laws. And children are not exempt from this widespread danger. Even if the Unnamed Children were required to first reside for a short time in ORR children shelters, they could do so safely. There are ORR facilities that have experience with communicable diseases. After the Title 42 Process went into place, the numbers dropped even more precipitously. The Unnamed Children are Hindered from Advocating for Their Own Interests 97. The first problem is the speed of the Title 42 Process. Because unaccompanied children subjected to the Title 42 Process can be deported in a matter of days, there is generally a very small window of time when the child is in the United States. Until recently, the public and immigration lawyers knew almost nothing about how the Title 42 Process operated. For example, it took weeks for the public and immigration lawyers to determine that children were being held in hotels prior to their expulsion. Even if the parent receives her child’s call, that parent is likely at a loss to determine what to do or who to call, particularly given Defendants’ rejection of the ordinary immigration system in favor of the novel, ill-understood, and secretive Title 42 Process. And it is not only a ban on entry, but provides for summary expulsion for those who entered the country. Hundreds of thousands of individuals continue to move back and forth across the U.S.Mexico border every day. All of the foregoing allegations are repeated and realleged as if fully set forth herein. Defendants’ subjection of the Unnamed Children to the Title 42 Process violates the TVPRA. Title 42 of the U.S. Code also does not authorize the expulsion of children from the United States without affording them the protections of the TVPRA or other statutory protections\n26\n\n\x0cCase 1:20-cv-02035 Document 1 Filed 07/24/20 Page 29 of 34\nafforded under the INA.

Defendants’ application of the Title 42 Process to the Unnamed Children has prevented them from applying for asylum in accordance with 8 U.S.C. § 1158(a)(1), and was therefore contrary to law, see 5 U.S.C. § 706(2)(A). In addition, by refusing to grant the Unnamed Children the meaningful opportunity to apply for asylum to which they are entitled, Defendants have withheld and unreasonably delayed actions mandated by the statute. FARRA prohibits the government from returning a noncitizen to a country where it is more likely than not that he would face torture.\n28\n\n\x0cCase 1:20-cv-02035 Document 1 Filed 07/24/20 Page 31 of 34\n135.

PC-IL-0042,"On September 13, 2018, the plaintiff filed a complaint in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution. The plaintiff, an author of a Pulitzer-prize winning book about the Attica Prison uprising, wished for her book to be made available to prisoners who are under the authority of the Illinois Department of Correction (IDOC). Her complaint alleged that the defendants, employees of IDOC, improperly censored her book by preventing it from being distributed in some of the prisons in the state. The complaint further alleged a violation of the plaintiff's free speech and due process rights, because there was no process available to challenge the censorship.

The case was assigned to Judge Sue E. Myerscough. The Uptown People's Law Center represent the plaintiff. 

The most recent amended complaint was filed by the plaintiff on April 30, 2019. The defendants filed their answer on June 4, 2019. The parties continued discovery through the spring and summer of 2020; they also considered mediation.

Subsequently, on September 29, 2020, the plaintiff filed for partial summary judgment and the defendants filed a separate motion for summary judgment one day later. In late October, the parties filed their respective response motions. The court granted a joint motion to continue the trial date pending the cross-motions for summary judgment, which had originally been scheduled for February 16, 2021.

Motions to Substitute Counsel 66 67 are ALLOWED. Attorney General Clayton Ankney and Asst. Attorney General Jeremy Tyrrell are both withdrawn as counsel for Defendants in this case. Plaintiff Heather Ann Thompson is a professor and historian at the University of Michigan. In 2016, Thompson authored Blood in the Water, a non-fiction book about the Attica Prison uprising in 1971. Melvin is being sued in his individual capacity for damages. At all relevant times, Austin acted under color of state law.\n10. The book provides a thorough history and analysis of the uprising, including the lead-up to the uprising, the week-long uprising itself, its brutal end at the hands of state troopers, and the protracted legal battles that ensued. The book has won high praise and numerous awards. She has visited prisons in other states to discuss the book. In one instance, she recorded a podcast at San Quentin State Prison in California, during which she discussed the book with prisoners incarcerated there. Regulations, policies, or practices that restrict the receipt of mail by prisoners are invalid unless they rationally relate to a legitimate penological interest. In February 2018, Thompson attempted to send a copy of Blood in the Water to Percell Dansberry, a prisoner at the Pontiac Correctional Center. Thompson has never received any notice about Defendants’ censorship of Blood in the Water, at Pontiac or elsewhere. The above-described violations of Thompson’s rights, as well as the irreparable and serious injuries she suffered as a result, were caused by censorship policies and practices adopted or approved by Defendant Baldwin in his capacity as head of the Illinois Department of Corrections.\n26. The censorship policies, practices, and customs, as well the regulations giving rise to them, are unconstitutionally overbroad in their construction and arbitrarily applied in practice. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution protects Thompson’s right to communicate with prisoners incarcerated with the Illinois Department of Corrections. Defendants’ actions were objectively unreasonable and were undertaken intentionally with malice, willfulness, or reckless indifference. Defendants’ actions have caused, and if not enjoined will continue to cause, damage to Thompson. Thompson seeks injunctive relief against Defendant John R. Baldwin in his official capacity, and nominal and compensatory damages against all individual Defendants. The Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects Thompson’s right to receive notice of, and an opportunity to appeal, Defendants’ decisions to censor her speech.\n8\n\n\x0c3:18-cv-03230-SEM-TSH # 1 Page 9 of 10\n41. Defendants’ actions were objectively unreasonable and were undertaken intentionally with malice, willfulness, or reckless indifference.\n43. This censorship of Blood in the Water and the failure of Defendants to provide adequate notice and explanation to Thompson violates her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights.\n22. The individual Defendants are responsible for, or personally participated in, creating and implementing these unconstitutional censorship policies, practices, and customs, and training and supervising the staff who carry them out.\n26. In this case, for example, prison officials allowed Thompson’s book to be delivered to prisoners incarcerated at Stateville and Logan, but refused to deliver the same book to a prisoner incarcerated at Pontiac—even though all three facilities are maximum security prisons operated by the Illinois Department of Corrections.\n27. Thompson incorporates by reference all of the allegations in paragraphs 1-29. Thompson also seeks punitive damages against all individual Defendants in their individual capacities.\nCOUNT II Violation of the Fourteenth Amendment (Due Process) – 42 U.S.C. § 1983 37.

EE-CO-0007,"In June 2006, the Phoenix District Office and Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed this lawsuit against distribution center operators Albertson's, Inc., Albertson's LLC, Supervalu, Inc. and Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging discrimination based on race, color, and/or national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendants maintained a hostile work environment and subjected the complaining parties to other adverse terms and conditions of employment.

The plaintiffs alleged long-term, continuing, and pervasive harassment and discrimination by supervisors and co-workers, including offensive and disparaging racial comments and graffiti, assignment of minorities to harder and less desirable duties, favoring of non-minorities in promotions, disciplining minorities more harshly, and Albertson’s failure to take appropriate, timely, and effective remedial action.

Supervalu, Inc. and Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. were dismissed from the lawsuit in October 2006. The parties engaged in discovery from 2006 through 2009. On December 3, 2007, the Court (Judge Wiley Y. Daniel) granted motions to allow four plaintiff intervenors to intervene, and the four plaintiff intervenors filed complaints that day. 

On April 28, 2008, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The case was reassigned to Judge Christine M. Arguello on October 22, 2008. Proceedings were stayed beginning in February, 2009 pending negotiation and finalization of a consent decree. At the time the consent decree was developed, Albertsons had represented that it planned to close its Colorado distribution center in late fall 2009 for business reasons unrelated to the action.

On December 11, 2009, the parties made a joint motion to consolidate this lawsuit with two other EEOC proceedings involving the Aurora, Colorado Albertson's distribution center. Judge Arguello granted the motion on December 14, 2009, and entered the consent decree that day. The consent decree included provisions against retaliation, a neutral reference for complaining parties, an equal employment opportunity training for supervisory and management employees, and certain terms should Albertson's open or reopen a distribution center in Colorado during the time of the consent decree.

The consent decree remained in effect for four years, and the case is now closed.","['IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO\nCivil Action No.: Defendant was aware of the harassment and that some managers participated in the harassment.\n14. The unlawful employment practices described above were done with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of employees based on their race, color, and/or national origin. In addition, production of the personnel files may be pursuant to a blanket protective order in the nature of the Appendix to Gillard v. Boulder Valley School Dist., Baxter incorporates his prior allegations herein. Baxter was subjected to discrimination based upon his age. During all times herein relevant, Defendant consistently maintained and condoned a work environment at the Distribution Center which was pervasively and severely hostile to black employees.\n49. Intervenors were subjected to a severe and pervasively hostile work environment at the Distribution Center because of their black race and/or color, in violation of Title VII.\n50. This unlawful employment practice was intentional. Solis initially assumed his schedule was subject to change because he was the least senior Mechanic. Intervenor was subjected to a severe and pervasively hostile work environment at the Distribution Center because of his Mexican-Hispanic national origin, in violation of Section 1981.\n40. These unlawful employment practices were willful and wanton, and/or were done with malice or with reckless indifference to Intervenor’s federally-protected rights. 06-cv-01273-WYD-BNB EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION, Plaintiff, and CHRISTOPHER ADAMS, JAMES BAXTER, LUIS SOLIS GONZÁLEZ, JAMES STEADHAM and NATE VALENTINE, Intervenors, vs. ALBERTSON’S LLC, Defendant. _____________________________________________________________________ At all times herein relevant, Defendant was an employer engaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Sections 701 (b), (g) and (h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §2000e (b), (g) and (h). Valentine himself has been referred to as the “token nigger,” and on one occasion, the racist writings were directed at him personally, stating “Nate is a nigger,” or words to that effect.\n19. Far more frequently than not, Sharits and Potter would ignore Valentine’s requests that they assign maintenance staff to immediately remove the offensive materials from the walls of the men’s rooms.\n30. Notwithstanding the multitude of occasions in which Valentine brought his own or his subordinate employees’ complaints about the racist graffiti and writings to the attention of the managers in his chain of command, to Valentine’s knowledge no Distribution Center employee has ever been disciplined, suspended or discharged for violating Defendant’s anti-harassment and Courtesy, Dignity and Respect policies.\n34.

Factual information that supports or rebuts the claim by the EEOC that Albertson’s discriminated against any past or present employee at the Distribution Center because he/she has opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practice by Title VII or because he/she had made a charge, testified, assisted or participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII.\nRule 30(b)(6) Notice at ¶ 3.\nThe EEOC correctly states that there is no claim for retaliation made in the complaint.

EE-AL-0006,"In September 2006, the EEOC brought this suit against AutoZone, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, under title VII of 42 U.S.C § 2000e. In this case, it is alleged that Autozone discharged an employee who worked in a store because he opposed discriminatory conduct of his supervisor (store manager) on the basis of race and sex. The EEOC asked for (a) a permanent injunction enjoining AutoZone from engaging in retaliating or any other employment discrimination practice on the basis of race, sex or retaliation; (b) an order for AutoZone to institute and carry out policies, practices and programs which provide equal employment opportunities; (c) an order for AutoZone to provide backpay and compensate to a discharged employee; and (d) punitive damages. 

In 2003, the employee recognized that his supervisor's conduct and statements towards employees and customers were racially and sexually derogatory and harassing in nature. The employee suggested his supervisor refrain from such behavior, wrote a letter to AutoZone's district manager about the supervisor's behavior, and visited AutoZone's regional human resources manager to report harassment by the supervisor. Autozone did not take any action about the reported behavior. The employee was then discharged by AutoZone in 2004.

On October 30, 2007, the District Court (Judge Kristi DuBose) granted AutoZone's motion for summary judgment stating that (1) AutoZone's discharge of him did not constitute retaliation against him after the involvement of EEOC; and (2) the supervisor's actions did not rise to the standard of racial harassment and sexual harassment, which are requirement of protection under title VII.  The District Court entered judgment for AutoZone and dismissed the EEOC's claim with prejudice .
","As alleged with greater particularity below, the Commission alleges that AutoZone, Inc. (“Defendant” or “AutoZone”) discriminated against Roderick Broughton, an African-American, by retaliating against him after he opposed racial and sexually discriminatory employment practices.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. On or about March 26, 2001, AutoZone hired Roderick Broughton as parts manager at Respondent’s Smyrna, Georgia store. Beginning as early as November 2003, Roderick Broughton complained about conduct he reasonably believed to be discriminatory on the bases of race and sex. In January 2004, following Roderick Broughton’s complaints to AutoZone, AutoZone commenced an investigation of sexual harassment allegations. On or about January 30, 2004, weeks after Roderick Broughton’s complaints to senior management, AutoZone terminated Roderick Broughton’s employment in retaliation for his complaints about the unlawful race and sex discrimination.\n14. The unlawful employment practices complained of in Paragraphs seven (7) through thirteen (13) were done with malice or with reckless indifference to the federally-protected rights of Roderick Broughton.\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF WHEREFORE, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: A. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant AutoZone, its officers, successors,\nassigns, and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in retaliation and any other employment practice which discriminates on the basis of race, sex or retaliation. G. Grant such further relief as the Court deems necessary and proper in the public interest. 81), and all evidentiary materials offered in support thereof. In early November 2003, Mr. Broughton voluntarily stepped down as Store Manager of Store #164 in Mobile, Alabama to assume a position as the Commercial Specialist. ( Initially, the relationship between Mr. Broughton and Mr. Walker was amicable. ( However, that apparently did not last.\nDuring the period of early November, 2003 through January, 2004, Mr. Broughton alleges that Mr. Walker’s conduct and statements towards employees and customers were racially and sexually derogatory and harassing in nature.1 (See generally Doc.

( Mr. Broughton filed an Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“EEOC”) charge of discrimination on June 28, 2004, alleging that he was discriminated against in violation of Title VII because he “participated in a sexual harassment investigation that involved an employee in management.” ( P. 56(c).2 The party seeking summary judgment bears “the initial burden to show the district court, by reference to materials on file, that there are no genuine issues of material fact that should be decided at trial.” The party seeking summary judgment always bears the “initial responsibility of informing the district court of the basis for its motion, and identifying those portions of ‘the pleadings, depositions, answers to\n2 Rule 56(c) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, provides that summary judgment shall be granted:\n[I]f the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.

IM-FL-0013,"On December 20, 2001, the Florida Legal Services Inc. Migrant Farmworker Justice Project filed a class action lawsuit on behalf of migrant farm workers in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging violations of Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act at Florida tomato and chili pepper packing houses.  The workers alleged that they were not paid overtime wages, employee Social Security taxes were deducted from their wages were never paid to the government and that their hours worked were incorrectly calculated. Plaintiffs sought monetary damages and class certification.

This was a companion case to the lawsuit Carranza v. Mecca Farms, Inc. [IM-FL-22] which was filed on behalf of field workers who worked on the farm operations of Mecca Farms, Inc.

On November 25, 2002, the District Court (Judge Donald M. Middlebrooks) certified the case as a class action, over the objections of defendants.  Two separate subclasses were created for the tomato and chili pepper packers. Martinez v. Mecca Farms, Inc., 213 F.R.D. 601, (S.D.Fla. 2002).

Shortly after class certification, the parties settled the case.  The District Court (Judge Middlebrooks) entered its order approving the settlement on April 3, 2003, retaining jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement, but otherwise dismissing and closing the case.  Under the terms of the Settlement Agreement, an unlimited joint settlement fund was created to settle claims in the Martinez case and in the companion case Luz-Carranza v. Mecca Farms, Inc., case no. 01-9013, filed on behalf of field workers. [IM-FL-22].  The defendants agreed to pay the Martinez class members $4.00 per day worked in the tomato packing houses and $3.00 per day worked in the pepper packing houses.  Defendants also agreed to file appropriate W-2 forms with the government.  Attorneys fees in the amount of $200,000.00 would be paid by defendants and a $25,000 contribution would also be made to a local farm workers assistance group.  Luz-Carranza class members were to be paid $5.00 per day for field work.

After reviewing the record and the parties’ submissions, it is the Court’s determination that the Plaintiff’s motion should be GRANTED.\nBackground\nThis is an action by six agricultural workers who claim that the defendants violated the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (“MPSA” or “AWPA”) during plaintiffs’ employment at defendant Mecca Farms’ Lantana, Florida packing houses. They\n\nseek to certify two classes under Fed. They claim that they are entitled to such pay. This led to the payroll records being inaccurate.

NS-CA-0007,"Plaintiffs, foreign nationals, filed suit in May 2007 in United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., a subsidiary of Boeing Company, for its participation in a U.S. extraordinary rendition program operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that apprehended, transported, imprisoned, interrogated, and, in some instances, tortured the plaintiffs. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, plaintiffs brought action under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350, alleging that Jeppesen provided flight planning and logistical support of the extraordinary rendition of plaintiffs, with knowledge that its involvement would lead to unlawful apprehension, detention, and possible torture.

In October 2007, the United States moved to intervene and moved to dismiss the case, asserting the ""states secret"" privilege. Then-director of the CIA, General Michael Hayden, filed declarations in support of the motion to dismiss, asserting that disclosure of information could cause serious or grave damage to national security. After conducting a hearing, the district court granted the motion to intervene and to dismiss. Mohamed v. Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., 539 F. Supp. 2d 1128 (N.D. Cal. 2008).

Plaintiffs immediately appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case, ruling that the states secret privilege in this context operated only as an evidentiary privilege, the exact parameters of which were indeterminate until plaintiffs made an actual request for discovery of specific evidence. Mohamed v. Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., 563 F. 3d 992 (9th Cir. 2009), amended by 579 F. 3d 943 (9th Cir. 2009).

Meanwhile, Barack Obama succeeded George W. Bush as President of the United States. His administration announced new policies for invoking the states secrets privilege and reviewed the assertion of privilege in this case. Government then requested the Ninth Circuit for a rehearing en banc, which the court granted. Mohamed v. Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., 586 F.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2009). 

Upon rehearing, an eleven judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court order of dismissal. Even though plaintiff's prima facie case and Jeppesen's defenses may not have depended on privileged evidence, the court found that ""the facts underlying plaintiffs' claims are so infused with state secrets, "" there was ""no feasible way to litigate Jeppesen's alleged liability without creating an unjustifiable risk of divulging state secrets."" Mohamed v. Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., 614 F.3d 1070, 1088, 1087 (9th Cir. 2010). The Ninth Circuit then noted possible nonjudicial relief, including government-provided reparations, a Congressional investigation and legislation restraining the executive branch, Congressional legislation enacting a private bill, and Congressional legislation enacting remedial schemes to address claims like plaintffs'.

Here, plaintiffs have not sued the government to enforce an alleged secret agreement between themselves and the Executive Branch.

( Before Jeppesen filed an answer to the complaint, the United States intervened, asserting that the state secrets privilege required dismissal of the entire action on the pleadings. He was also blindfolded and handcuffed while being made ‘‘to listen to extremely loud music day and night.’’ There he was detained in a CIA ‘‘dark prison’’ where he underwent further torture, including being kept in ‘‘near permanent darkness’’ and subjected to loud noise, such as the screams of women and children, for twenty-four hours per day. Jeppesen’s Involvement in the Rendition Program\nAccording to plaintiffs, publicly available evidence establishes that Jeppesen provid-\n\n\x0cMOHAMED v. JEPPESEN DATAPLAN, INC.\nCite as 563 F.3d 992 (9th Cir. He stated that Overby had explained, ‘‘ ‘that’s just the way it is, we’re doing them’ ’’ because ‘‘the rendition flights paid very well. Inc. v. Bush, 507 F.3d 1190, 1196 (9th Cir.2007).\nIII. Neither Totten’s facts nor its logic supports that conclusion.\nIn the first place, not all of plaintiffs’ theories of liability require proof of a relationship between Jeppesen and the government. 2576, 159 L.Ed.2d 459 (2004) (quoting United States v. Nixon, 418 U.S. 683, 692, 94 S.Ct. According to the government’s theory, the Judiciary should effectively cordon off all secret government actions from judicial scrutiny, immunizing the CIA and its partners from the demands and limits of the law.\nWe reject this interpretation of the ‘‘very subject matter’’ concept, not only because it is unsupported by the case law, but because it forces an unnecessary zerosum decision between the Judiciary’s constitutional duty ‘‘to say what the law is,’’ Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 177, 2 L.Ed. 528, rather than by application of the winnertakes-all Totten rule.\n[11] Within the Reynolds’s framework, the President’s interest in keeping state secrets secret is, of course, still protected: the court must balance ‘‘the circumstances of the case’’ and the plaintiff’s ‘‘showing of necessity’’ for the evidence against the ‘‘danger that compulsion of evidence will expose matters which, in the interest of national security, should not be divulged.’’ quoting Scheuer, 416 U.S. at 236, 94 S.Ct. 2009)\n\n1009\n\nof specific evidence, (2) an explanation from plaintiffs of their need for the evidence, and (3) a formal invocation of the privilege by the government with respect to that evidence, explaining why it must remain confidential. Cir.2005) (‘‘deciding the impact of the government’s assertion of the state secrets privilege’’ before the record is ‘‘adequately developed’’ puts ‘‘the cart before the horse’’). Within the Reynolds framework, the ‘‘litigation can proceed,’’\n\ntherefore, so long as (1) ‘‘the plaintiffs can prove ‘the essential facts’ of their claims ‘without resort to [privileged evidence],’ ’’ id. (quoting Reynolds, 345 U.S. at 11, 73 S.Ct. Here, because Jeppesen has not even answered the complaint, it is uncertain which allegations are in dispute, much less which disputes might raise genuine issues of material fact.\n\nThe procedural posture of this case thus differs fundamentally from that in Kasza, which involved a grant of summary judgment. See Thigpen v. Roberts, 468 U.S. 27, 29–30, 104 S.Ct. See, e.g., Kasza v. Browner, 133 F.3d 1159, 1166 (9th Cir.1998).\nThis is important, because an approach that focuses on specific evidence after issues are joined has the benefit of confining the operation of the state secrets doctrine so that it will sweep no more broadly than\n\n16. And when responsive pleading is complete and discovery under way, judgments as to whether secret material is essential to Plaintiffs’ case or Jeppesen’s defense can be made more accurately.\nBy refusing to examine the voluminous public record materials submitted by Plaintiffs in support of their claims,2 and by failing to undertake an analysis of Jeppesen’s ability to defend against those claims, the district court forced every judge of the court of appeals to undertake that effort. at 1078]—and the concurrence’s fullblown embrace of its application here merit response.\nCourts have applied the Totten bar in one of two scenarios: (1) The plaintiff is party to a secret agreement with the government;8 or (2) The plaintiff sues to solicit information from the government on a ‘‘state secret’’ matter.9 See Weinberger v.\n\n6. See Terkel v. AT & T Corp., 441 F.Supp.2d 899, 907 (N.D.III.2006) (refusing to apply Totten because ‘‘the plaintiffs in this case were not parties to the alleged contract nor did they agree to its terms; rather, they claim\n\nthat the performance of an alleged contract entered into by others would violate their statutory rights’’); Am. Id. (citing 5 C. Wright & A. Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure § 1280, at 360 (1969)).\nAccording to this rationale, Plaintiffs are correct that the government moving forward may assert the state secrets privilege to prevent Jeppesen from answering any allegations, where the answer would constitute evidence properly protected by the privilege. Id. (Scalia, J., dissenting) (quoting 1 Blackstone 131–33 (1765)) (emphasis added).\nI would remand to the district court to determine whether Plaintiffs can establish the prima facie elements of their claims or whether Jeppesen could defend against those claims without resort to state secrets evidence.\n\n\x0c1102\n\n614 FEDERAL REPORTER, 3d SERIES APPENDIX\n\n\x0cMOHAMED v.

PN-NJ-0005,"Plaintiff, the editor of a local newspaper, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts against the Newark Police Department on January 23, 2008 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and N.J.S.A. 10:6-1. Plaintiff, represented by attorneys from Seton Hall University School of Law and the ACLU of New Jersey, sought damages, alleging that police officers violated his First Amendment right to receive and record information for later dissemination, Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures, corresponding provisions in the New Jersey State Constitution, and the New Jersey Reporter Shield Law. Specifically, plaintiff's allegations revolved around an August 4, 2007 incident in which Newark Police Department officers confiscated a photographer's camera and detained plaintiff under threat of arrest until he agreed to turn over all copies of photographs related to a murder in a rash of violence in the city described as an embarrassment to local law enforcement.

On December 23, 2009, plaintiff petitioned for judgment after agreeing with the Newark Police Department to settle the case in the amount of $55,000. On the same day, plaintiff also filed a Request to File an Application for Attorneys' Fees. In entering judgment on February 22, 2010, the District Court (Judge Faith S. Hochberg) granted the judgment in the amount of $55,000 and denied plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees on the grounds that the settlement agreement included all attorneys' fees.

Plaintiff appealed that decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on March 9, 2010. On July 19, 2011, the Court of Appeals (Judge Thomas M. Hardiman) reversed the District Court and held that, since the offer of settlement did not explicitly reference the inclusion of fees, attorneys' fees were not included in the settlement. The case was remanded to the District Court to determine reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.

On October 13, 2011, the parties settled the remaining attorneys' fees claim. On October 24, 2011, the District Court (Judge Faith S. Hochberg) ordered the case closed. Plaintiff entered a notice that the judgment of $55,000, and additional attorneys' fees, had been paid in full on October 23, 2012.

Mr. Lima is the editor of the Brazilian Voice, a Portuguese-language newspaper published in Newark to report on issues of concern to the local Brazilian community. On August 4, 2007, three college students were the victims of a brutal, executionstyle murder in Newark. When he was introduced to the photographer, Defendant Demaio commenced an intimidating interrogation. On information and belief, the unidentified individual on the phone was Defendant Demaio; it appears that Defendant Demaio ordered the officer at the police station to refuse to return the camera to Mr. Lima.\n6\n\n\x0cCase 2:08-cv-00426-FSH-PS Document 1 Filed 01/23/08 Page 7 of 14 PageID: 7\n25.

At that point, one of the officers at the precinct, Defendant John Doe, placed Mr. Lima under arrest, handcuffing him to a bench in the police station.\n28. Mr. Lima remarked to Defendant James that the way the police had treated him that night would discourage people from helping the police in the future. In an effort to harass and attempt to intimidate Mr. Lima, the NPD had two unmarked police cars take turns parking in front of the office of Mr. Lima’s newspaper on the day of his meeting with the mayor. Mr. Lima has a constitutionally protected right under the First Amendment to the United States Constitution to receive and record information and to gather information for later dissemination in a peaceful manner. Defendants had no warrant and no probable cause to arrest Mr. Lima, nor was Mr. Lima acting in a suspicious or potentially dangerous manner.

Barely a month after these three murders, Mr. Lima - the editor of a local newspaper - and his staff discovered a dead body, alerted the police, and directed them to the scene. On September 6, 2007, a photographer for the Brazilian Voice was taking pictures on foot in the vicinity of the movie theater on Foundry Street in the Ironbound section of Newark. Mr. Lima, a recognized leader in the Newark- Brazilian community, had at that time an excellent relationship and regular contact with the NPD. While Mr. Lima contacted Mr. Campos, the two staff members took additional pictures.\n20. Upon his arrival, he ignored a junior officer who attempted to explain what the police had learned about the incident up to that point. By advising the NPD and its officers that Mr. Lima could be arrested for refusing to tum over all of his photographs, and that his photographs could be lawfully seized, Defendants Brewington, Carter, Imhof, Sukhdeo, and Loe 1 through 4 also contributed to the violation of Mr. Lima\'s First Amendment rights.\nSECOND CAUSE OF ACTION: VIOLATION OF ARTICLE I, PARAGRAPH 6 OF\nTHE NEW JERSEY CONSTITUTION (Unlawful Interference with and Restraint of Free Speech) 45.

EE-TX-0195,"In September 2003, the EEOC district office of San Antonio, Texas brought this suit against Key Energy Services, Inc., the parent company of Brooks Well Servicing, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas.  The complaint alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in that a female employee was sexually harassed by a male manager and male coworkers when they made obscene comments, sexual innuendos, and requested to have sex with her.  The charging party then intervened as a plaintiff. After some initial discovery, the EEOC moved for partial summary judgment in May 2004.  The parties settled in less than a month and in June 2004 a consent decree was issued.

The parties agreed that the injunctive terms of the agreement would extend for three years and that there shall be 10 days notice to defendant if there is a belief that it is violating the agreement and a subsequent face-to-face conference to resolve any issues.  The defendant was enjoined from discriminating on the basis of sex, was not to retaliate against any employee who complains of such discrimination, and had to distribute a copy of its nondiscrimination policy to all current employees.  The female employee received $30,001.40 and her attorney received $27,498.60.  All employees, supervisors and managers were to receive no less than four hours of training on the employment provisions of Title VII.  This training was to be repeated every year within 30 days of the anniversary of the decree.  Further, an EEOC prepared notice was to be conspicuously displayed in the defendant's Texas facility for the duration of the agreement.

PC-CO-0002,"On July 27, 1995 Colorado inmates incarcerated at Bowie County Correctional Facility (BCCF) in Texas filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado.  Plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and private attorneys. Plaintiffs' complaint, filed in November of 1995, alleged an abusive, overcrowded, unsanitary, and unhealthful environment at BCCF.  It alleged forced idleness, fire danger, deficient medical care, and lack of access to the courts due to an inadequate law library.  In addition, plaintiffs claimed that BCCF violated the Establishment Clause by paying inmates to attend a Bible study class when there was little or no paid work available to other inmates and no other religious activities.  

Defendants moved for transfer and change of venue.   The district court (Judge John L. Kane, Jr.) denied these motions.  Knapp v. Romer, 909 F.Supp. 810 (D. Colo. 1995).     

A number of lawsuits were filed in the District of Colorado regarding conditions at BCCF.  The cases were consolidated until September 30, 1997, when Judge Kane issued an order ending consolidation and certifying the case as a class action to be represented by counsel for one of the claims, Leggions, et al v. CO Dept. Corrections, et al.  Litigation continued, with the court granting many plaintiffs' motions for exclusion from class representation and several motions for joinder.  The PACER docket for this case ends on February 25, 1999 so no information regarding further proceedings is available.

","['Knapp v. Romer\n\n-CO-002-001\n\n""95 NOV 17 P4:46 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\nFOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO\n\n. Miller of the American Civil Liberties Union, assert this complaint against defendants.\nI. Preliminary Statement 1. Defendants Roy S. Romer and Aristedes Zavaras reside in the District of Colorado. The named Plaintiffs are adult inmates in BCCF. The Defendants have acted and refused to act on grounds generally applicable to the class. One manifestation of this lack of training is a series of raciallybased threats to inmates by BCCF staff. These agencies include the Texas State Health Inspectors, the Texas Commission on Jail Standards and the Colorado Department of Corrections. BCCF staff indiscriminately use chemical spray as a means of control, which, due to the dormitory structure of the BCCF facility, results in the serious punishment of many inmates who have done nothing wrong.\n\n\x0c27. The BCCF management is aware of these incidents and has failed to investigate or punish offenders appropriately.\n28. BCCF staff have used pepper spray and tear gas on numerous occasions to punish entire pods for the actions of a few inmates. On or about June 10, 1995, Glenn Pierce was physically and verbally assaulted by Officers Moses and Woods, in full view of and with the apparent assent of lieutenant Henson. Officers Moses and Woods picked Mr. Pierce up from behind and thrust him into a wall, cutting his face above his eyebrow. He was told that he ""was asking too many questions and filing too many grievances."" The officers then kicked him several times. After about 15 minutes his hands were numb. The officers threatened to mace Mr. Coca further if he reported the incident.\n10\n\n\x0c34. The officers who could be identified include Sergeant Anthony and officers Hancock, McDowell, Olive, Giles, Armstrong, Golden, and Hurbert. He was placed in segregation under punitive conditions thereafter. Mr. Valdez was beaten and injured by BCCF correctional staff even though he was not involved in what was later described as a riot.\n39. On or about July 27, 1995, Kevin McClearen, after filing numerous grievances to which he received no response, refused to return to his pod until he received an explanation for the $48 which was missing from his commissary account. Suddenly, one of the guards ordered the inmates ""off the fence."" In addition, inmates who cannot pay to purchase certain medical items have had them withheld, and inmates with serious medical problems are housed in cells with poor ventilation and no natural light. BCCFs Nurse told Mr. Westley that his injury did not warrant medical attention and sent him back to his cell. Ray Shaffer was processed through the admissions unit in the Colorado Department of Corrections in or around May 1995. His requests for treatment were ignored until August 23, 1995, when he was taken to a dermatologist in Texarkana, who reported that he had gone too long without treatment and would* therefore have to have surgery. Mr. Montague is indigent, and while he sought to participate in programs and jobs, he was refused such activity until recently when he was given a $1 per work day job.\nD. Living Conditions 54. The floor where Mr. Collins is required to sleep is infested with insects and spiders, some poisonous; Mr. Collins received a bite that required surgery.\n59. BCCF was not designed to house the number of inmates now incarcerated there. The BCCF staff has considered cleaning supplies a privilege; they are only made available if the inmates behave well. The Plaintiffs are not provided with adequate clean bedding. William Carter found an insect in his food on September 27, 1995. This has resulted in inmates being assaulted. The group of Colorado inmates transferred by defendants to BCCF include special management inmates. The failure to separate these inmates from the general population creates an unsafe and hazardous condition for all inmates.\n21\n\n\x0c76. The only program which an appreciable number of inmates in the plaintiff class have been able to access is the Bible Study class, and inmates must choose between staying in their cells or attending this class. The next day when he was released and tried to obtain his glasses, he was told that since they were not on his property list they would be kept from him. There is no one on the BCCF staff who can adequately instruct inmates in the use of the CD-ROM, and so the system is largely unusable. The Plaintiffs offer what they call a Bible Study class to inmates for pay. Additionally, Plaintiffs have been deprived of basic human needs in core areas such as adequate shelter, sanitation, personal safety, and medical, dental and mental health care. F. Enjoin Defendants from housing Plaintiffs and the class they represent at the BCCF; G. Award Plaintiffs their reasonable costs, attorneys\' fees and expert witnesses fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1988; and H. Grant such other further relief as may be just and equitable.\n27\n\n\x0cDated November 17, 1995. Plaintiffs contend BCCF fails to meet minimum constitutional standards. Part VIII (filed Nov. 17, 1995).\nDefendants deny the conditions under which Colorado inmates are kept at BCCF violate constitutional standards and deny Plaintiffs are entitled to any relief. Chrysler Credit Corp. v. Country Chrysler, Inc., 928 F.2d 1509, 1515 (10th Cir.1991) (citing Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno, 454 U.S. 235, 254, 102 S.Ct. DISCUSSION\nDefendants argue Plaintiffs\' choice of forum should be given less weight in this case because the prison conditions at issue exist in Texas; most of the inmates and other fact witnesses reside in Texas; and those who reside in Colorado would be moved at Defendants\' expense anyway.

VR-MI-0074,"On August 30th, 2018, several student groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Plaintiffs sued the Michigan Secretary of State, Ruth Johnson, and the Director of the Michigan Bureau of Elections, Sally Williams under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and §1988 for alleged constitutional violations of the First, Fourteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments. The plaintiffs, represented by a combination of public interest and private attorneys, sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the State from enforcing Public Act 118, also known as Roger’s Law, which plaintiffs alleged put significant barriers in place for college aged students who wanted to vote. The case was assigned to District Judge Robert H. Cleland.

Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that Roger’s Law placed two major barriers in the way of students seeking to vote: Strict matching requirements and requirement that a person first vote in person. The strict matching requirement prohibited college students, who had their home address listed on state identification, from using said identification to register to vote in their college town. The in-person voting requirement prohibited college students, who would need to return to their permanent addresses to vote, from voting if they were far from home. Plaintiff claimed that these laws were driven to enactment by discriminatory intent, as shown through the explicit statement by the legislation’s drafter that he didn’t care if college-aged students couldn’t vote.

The complaint was later amended on September 7th, 2018, to add new plaintiffs, specifically more student groups. 

On September 8th, 2018, a motion for preliminary injunction was filed, but stayed while the parties negotiated a potential settlement. Along with the motion, the plaintiffs filed an expert report from Stanford Political Science Professor Jonathan Rodden supporting their arguments. 2018 WL 10072776. On September 25, the plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew their preliminary injunction. They did this because of their preparations for the 2018 midterm elections, and the potential impact that the elections would have on the outcome of the case. Status updates were moved to January 9, 2019. 

Status updates were further delayed as the Whitmer administration was sworn in and implemented policies that expanded access to vote-by-mail programs. The plaintiffs submitted a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case on June 5, 2019, perhaps because of progress toward the plaintiff's asks by the Whitmer administration. Judge Cleland dismissed the case on June 11; the case is closed.","County of 1st Plaintiff: Washtenaw − County Where Action Arose: Washtenaw − County of 1st Defendant: Ingham.

I can then examine registration and turnout numbers in November of 2000, immediately after the reform was implemented, but before the precincts were redrawn, to see if registration and turnout were lower in precincts with relatively large student populations.\nBoth turnout and registration were relatively flat in the parts of Kalamazoo without large student populations, while sudden, rapid declines were evident in\n40\n\n\x0cCase 3:18-cv-12722-RHC-SDD ECF No. 13-3 filed 09/08/18 PageID.292 Page 46 of 61\nconclusion that the ward boundaries were drawn in this way to prevent students from forming majorities in any of the five wards.\nNevertheless, Ann Arbor is a useful college town to examine, because Washtenaw County publishes historical registration counts for each precinct in each year. In other words, new registrants and new voters are, as one would anticipate, disproportionately young.\nThe overall rate of absentee voting among registered voters in Michigan in the 2016 general election was 17 percent. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the gap between overall turnout and that of young people is greater in Michigan than in any other state.",0.6143,0.1617,0.256,0.1527,0.0401,0.0636,0.2482,0.0653,0.1034
EE-KS-0015,"On September 30, 2003, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed suit in the Wichita U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas against O'Reilly Automotive, Inc., (doing business as O'Reilly Auto Parts) on behalf of a female employee. According to the EEOC, O'Reilly Automotive violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, by forcing the pregnant employee, an assistant manager whose doctor had imposed a 30-pound lifting restriction, to take unpaid leave and subsequently firing her. The EEOC sought its costs and monetary and injunctive relief for the employee, including policy reform, backpay, reinstatement, medical expenses, compensation for emotional harm, and punitive damages.

The parties reached a settlement, which the Court (Judge Wesley E. Brown) entered as a consent decree on June 17, 2004. The 2-year decree provided $50,000 in monetary relief ($15,000 in lost wages and $35,000 in compensatory damages), subject to execution of a release of claims. The decree also provided for up to $200 for the employee to consult an attorney before signing the release. Under the injunctive provisions of the decree, O'Reilly Automotive was required to provide a positive reference, to adopt and distribute anti-pregnancy-discrimination policies to managers and supervisors, to provide equal employment training to all managers and supervisors, to post a pregnancy discrimination notice, and to report to the EEOC every 6 months about employees who took pregnancy-related leave, including whether the leave was voluntary, whether the employee was terminated, and why. The parties bore their own costs. No further court activity appears on the docket and the case is now closed.","['IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS\n\nEQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION,\nPlaintiff,\nv.\nO\'Reilly Automotive, Inc. d/b/a O\'Reilly Auto Parts,\nDefendant.\n\n) ) ) ) ) CIVIL ACTION NO.

EE-FL-0091,"The Miami District office of the EEOC filed suit against Outback Steakhouse of Florida, Inc. on September 30, 1999 in the U.S. District Court in the Middle District of Florida.  The EEOC claimed that Outback violated Title VII and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 when it discriminated against the intervenor employee based on sex (female), paid her less money than her male counterparts, transferred her based on retaliation, attempted to force her to sign an illegal release concerning her rights under Title VII, and ultimately fired her for not signing the release.  The intervenor intervened in December 1999 citing the same Title VII issues found in the EEOC's brief.  After both sides filed motions for summary judgment, which were denied, the case went to trial on September 10, 2001.  Eight days later, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, awarding the plaintiff $27,108.28 in earnings, $36,894.61 in back pay, $50,000 for pain and suffering, and $2,100,000.00 in punitive damages.  However, since punitive damages are capped by 42 U.S.C. s 1981a(b)(3)(D), the total award amounted to $364,002.89.  This award was decreased to $346,369.43 after the court granted the defendant's motion to amend the judgment.  The court also granted the intervenor $90,501.38 in fees.

Outback appealed a number of post-trial motions for a new trial, judgment as a matter of law, and others.  The EEOC cross-appealed and motioned to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, which the appellate court granted.  The district court then sent the two parties to post-judgment mediation for injunctive relief and the issues raised in the appellate court.  Ultimately, the court entered a post-judgment consent decree, awarding equitable relief. The defendant was required to conduct training twice a year; submit reports of complaints to the EEOC; post notice of equal employment rights; and refrain from discrimination and retaliation.

Finally, viewing the evidence and testimony in the light most favorable to the Defendant as the Court must do within the context of a rule 50 motion, the Court agrees with the Defendant\'s position that the delay occasioned in the Intervenor\'s receipt of her final paycheck could have reasonably ""resulted from a miscommunication between Zechella and Butler; namely, the fact that Butler expected Zechella, after talking with Outback\'s attorney, to return and pick up her checks, which she never did."" 8:99-cv-2218-T -26MSS\n\n"" , , ~-, \' -,\n\nI\n\n: •\n\nl~> U\n\n_.-\n\nr\n\n, r ;\'\nUl\n\nPOSTJUDGMENT CONSENT DECREE\n\nOn September 29, 1999, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission\n\nbrought this action against Outback Steakhouse, Inc.

PB-FL-0009,"The Plaintiff in this case has been paralyzed from the chest down ever since an accident in 2007.  She has limited mobility and manual dexterity, and thus requires some assistance in caring for herself carrying out daily activities. After her accident, she placed herself on the waitlist for Florida Medicaid's Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord (TBI/SC) Waiver Program.  

In early 2010, Plaintiff's husband and primary caregiver left her home following a divorce. She then contacted the state in the hope of receiving Waiver services but was told she would need to spend 60 days in an institution to then be eligible for community-based services to meet her needs. She then filed this lawsuit on May 13, 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida challenging this condition for receipt of services as a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. She filed a concurrent complaint and motion for preliminary injunction, asking the court to order the state to immediately provide services that will allow her to remain in the community.  The U.S. Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest supporting the Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. 

At a June 15, 2010 hearing, the Plaintiff's counsel informed the court that the Plaintiff had been hospitalized due to an unrelated issue, but that she would not be able to return home without the services that the TBI/SC waiver provides.  After additional briefing, the District Court (Judge Marcia Morales Howard) granted the motion for preliminary injunction and ordered that the Plaintiff begin to receive services on June 23, 2010 so that she could be discharged from the hospital.  The court issued its full analysis in granting the preliminary injunction on July 9, 2010.  

In March 2011, the court denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that the Plaintiff had stated a claim under the ADA. At this time, the Plaintiff had been enrolled in the waiver program for several months. Thus, the parties stipulated to settle the claims with no further obligations for the Defendants. After some dispute over attorney's fees, the parties agreed to dismiss the matter on April 19, 2011.  ","['Case 3:10-cv-00414-MMH-TEM Document 1 Filed 05/13/10 Page 1 of 14 PageID 1\nr. In November, 2009, Ms. Haddad\'s husband divorced her but continued to reside with her until March 2010, when Anthony was able to move into her home. Defendants\' employee did not know when, or if, Ms. Haddad would receive Waiver services. 45 C.F.R. § 84.4(b)(4); 28 C.F.R. § 41.51(b)(3)(i). Defendants\' denial of Medicaid funding for the in-home health services that Plaintiff requires to avoid segregation in an institution and remain in the integrated home settings that is appropriate to their needs constitutes unlawful discrimination in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. §794(a), and its implementing regulation, 28 C.F.R. §41.51(d).\n78. Defendants do not dispute that Plaintiff Haddad is a qualified person with a disability who meets the eligibility requirements for Florida\'s Medicaid nursing home ""level of care"" as well as for its waiver and Medicaid programs.\nC. The ADA and Section 504\'s Integration Mandate Under both the ADA and Section 504, the Attorney General was directed to promulgate implementing regulations. Both the ADA and Section 504 affirmatively require that covered entities make reasonable modifications and accommodations to their policies and practices when necessary to accommodate individuals with disabilities, see Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 592; Alexander, 469 U.S. at 301, and require that people with disabilities have ""meaningful access"" to covered entities\' programs. See e.g., Radaxzewski, 383 F.3d at 613-15; Frederick L. v. Dept\'t ofPublic Welfare, 364 F.3d 487,500 (3rd Cir. Providing the requested accommodation falls squarely within the duties imposed upon Defendants by either the Medicaid waiver or the Medicaid personal care option.\nBy contrast, if Plaintiff Haddad must leave her home and go to a nursing facility, Defendants will expend more Medicaid funds than they would were she in the community. Despite the substantial waiting list\nfor these services,7 defendants have not sought to increase the number of individuals it\nplans to serve under the waiver.8 Instead of serving these individuals in the community,\n5 Waiver programs allow states to provide home and community based services to individuals with disabilities who would otherwise require the level of care provided in institutions such as nursing homes. Ms. Haddad notified defendants of this change and her elevated need for communitybased services under the waiver. ( Fla. 1983) (citing Texas v. Seatrain International, S.A., 518 F.2d 175, 179 (5th Cir. See Complaint, e.g., ¶¶ 49, 52, 74, Relief Requested. As the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated in Charter Fed.

As the Affidavit of Kristen Russell, dated June 2, 2010, demonstrates, less than 10% of the individuals on the waiting list for the TBI/SCI Waiver program currently reside in a nursing facility. Id. However, this does not describe the Defendants in the instant case. See, e.g. Gresham, 730 F.2d at 1424 (granting preliminary injunction after finding irreparable harm when an individual is forced to sever his or her ties to the community due to housing discrimination). Horton v. St. Augustine, 272 F.3d 1318, 1326 (11th Cir. 29-10; January 8, 2010 Letter).\n\n-4-\n\n\x0cCase 3:10-cv-00414-MMH-TEM Document 49 Filed 07/09/10 Page 5 of 39 PageID 843\nMemorandum in Response to the Court’s Request Regarding Pr eliminary Injunction Standards (Doc.

Cates , 256 F. 3d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir. Unlike these plaintiffs, Plaintiff Haddad was not a party to the Dubois litigation.\nIn an effort to overcome this deficiency,Defendants assert that astrict reading of the class certified in Dubois establishes that Plaintiff is bound by that adjudication because she falls within the class definition which included “all individuals with traumatic brain or spinal cord injuries who the state hasalready determined or will determine to be eligible to receive services from Florida’s Medicaid Waiver Program . . . Indeed, Harris recognized that the ADA includes an express statutory right of action. at 36-38.\nAlternatively, Defendants argue that Plaintiff cannot pursue her ADA claim because the Court must respect the pal in language of the ADA regulationswhich instruct that a public entity need not provide personal care services. Defendants attempt to characterize such a finding as an invalidation of the Medicaid Act is without merit.\nHaving dispensed with Defendants’ general challenges to Plaintiff’s ability topursue the instant cause of action, the Court turns its attention to the determination set forth in the June 23, 2010 Order that Plaintiff has cle arly established that she has a substantial likelihood of prevailing on the merits of her claims. However, Defendants have pointed to no evidence, save for the single statement in the Russell Affidavit I that “[i]f the TBI/SCI Waiver Program were forced by court order toplace Ms. Haddad in the program, we would have to reduce services that others in the TBI/SCI Waiver Program are currently receiving.” The ADA‟s implementing regulations do not create a private right of action, and this Court cannot ignore the plain meaning of the regulation excluding PCA from the ADA‟s reach.\nBecause Plaintiff does not allege violations of the ADA, Rehab Act, or Medicaid Act, and the Defendants‟ alleged conduct does not constitute discrimination under the ADA, Plaintiff fails to state a claim upon which relief can be granted and the Complaint should be dismissed pursuant to Rule 12(b)(6), Fed. This statement, which is not itself a regulation, says nothing about the provision of PCA in the community. However, nursing facilities provide these services incidentally from the custodial relationship between the nursing facility and the Medicaid recipient, in order to keep the residents in optimum health. Plaintiff’s Claim Fails to State a Claim Upon Which Relief Can Be Granted\nBecause It Would Result in an Impermissible Fundamental Alteration to the Florida Medicaid Program in Violation of the ADA The regulations implementing Title II of the ADA provide that a “public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.” Because the relief requested under the ADA would fundamentally alter the Florida Medicaid Program, it is not required by the ADA and Plaintiff has failed to state a claim upon which relief can be granted. See e.g. Concordia v. Bendekovic, 693 F.2d 1073, 1075-76 (11th Cir. SFM Holdings, Ltd., 600 F.3d at 1337; see also Brown v. Brock, 169 F. App’x 579, 582 (11th Cir. Harper v. Lawrence County, Ala., 592 F.3d 1227, 1232 (11th Cir. When these requirements are met, states must provide services to individuals in community settings rather than in institutions. 32-3; Exhibit C).\nA party may raise an affirmative defense, such as collateral estoppel, in a Rule 12(b)(6) motion, where the existence of the defense can be judged on the face of the complaint. services of a personal nature, including assistance in eating, toileting, or dressing.” See Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 601 (“Medicaid has provided funding for state-run home and community-based care through a waiver program” and holding that mentally disabled respondents were qualified for community-based personal care).\n28\n\n\x0cCase 3:10-cv-00414-MMH-TEM Document 63 Filed 03/16/11 Page 29 of 34 PageID 949\n. . . Plaintiff alleges that the cost to Defendants of providing her community-based personal services would be less than providing those same services in the institutionalized setting, to which Defendants are requiring her to submit. Defendants argue first that Plaintiff’s claims would “allow” the ADA to “trump” the Medicaid Act resulting in a “fundamental alteration” of the state’s Medicaid Program. Again, Defendants cite to the Russell Affidavit, attached as an exhibit to their Motion to Dismiss, and to affidavits submitted in opposition to Plaintiff’s Motion for Preliminary Injunction.15 The Court has declined to consider Defendants’ affidavits for purposes of resolving the instant motion.\nRecognizing that a State must have some “leeway” to administer services to disabled persons in community settings “with an even hand,” the Supreme Court discussed the “fundamental-alteration defense.” Signed by Judge Marcia Morales Howard on 7/9/2010.

JI-LA-0007,"This is one of a collection of § 1983 inmate cases filed in Louisiana federal courts to challenge the operation and conditions of confinement in the Louisiana prison system and in parish and city jails through Louisiana.  These cases have worked their way through the federal courts over the last four decades and are part of this collection, located at PC-LA, JC-LA and JI-LA.

In this case, private plaintiffs filed a civil rights class action in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Louisiana to challenge the abusive and inhumane conditions inflicted upon juveniles confined at the Jena Juvenile Justice Center (""Jena"") in Jena, Louisiana. 

The lawsuit followed the November 1998 filing of the case, U.S. v. Louisiana, [JI-LA-1] which alleged unconstitutional conditions of confinement at other juvenile detention centers in Jetson, Bridge City, Swanson and Tallulah, Louisiana.

In April 2000, the DOJ, plaintiffs and defendants entered into a settlement agreement (""the Jena Agreement"") to resolve demands for preliminary injunctive relief sought by the DOJ in U.S. v. State of Louisiana, and by the Private Plaintiffs in A.A., et al. v. Wackenhut Corrections Corp., et al. CIV.A. 00-246-B-M1 [JI-LA-7] regarding conditions at Jena Juvenile Justice Center.  The District Court (Judge Frank J. Polozola) approved the Agreement on April 13, 2000.  An amendment to the Jena Agreement was filed on May 9, 2000.

On October 3, 2000, the District Court approved the  Joint Settlement Agreement for Medical, Dental, Mental Health, Rehabilitation and Juvenile Justice Issues (""2000 Settlement Agreement"") reached in this case and the cases, U.S. v. Louisiana, was consolidated with Williams v. Edwards, Civ. No. 71-98-B [PC-LA-1] and Brian B. v. Stadler, Civ. No. 98-886-B-M1 [JI-LA-6] and In Re: Juvenile Facilities ) Civ. No. Ch 97-Ms-001-B [JI-LA-8].

The case was ordered administratively closed and no further activity was noted on the PACER docket as of the date of this summary.

","['UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT MIDDLE DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\n\nA.A., A.S. B.J., B.W. and D.S., minor juveniles by and through their Guardian ad Litem, ERNESTINE WILLIAMS; C.B., by and through his Tutor, JANICE SANFORD; and C.C., a major juvenile, all appearing individually in pseudonym and on behalf of others similarly situated,\n\nCivil Action No. He is a minor and appears herein through his Guardian ad litem Mrs. Ernestine Williams. B.W. is a youth currently incarcerated at JJJC. Some of the conditions, policies, and practices complained of herein which have particularly impacted him are: excessive force by staff; abusive and arbitrary punishment; lack of food; denial of access to courts; lack of programming; lack of recreation; unsanitary conditions; and verbal abuse.\n16. He is sued in his official capacity.\n23. Thus, joinder of all potential plaintiffs is impracticable. All youth at JJJC are subject to these deficiencies. This class action is maintainable under FED. C.B. has exhausted his administrative remedies. Although the time for responding to these ARPs has passed, he has not received a response on many of these ARPs and has not been granted effective relief for the issues raised in these ARPs.\n43. Plaintiffs are not required to exhaust administrative remedies. Defendants’ Administrative Remedy Procedure (“ARP”) is too complex for Plaintiffs not represented by counsel, given the low maturity and educational level of members of the Plaintiff Class. Defendants do not provide any assistance from a “classification officer” or “inmate counsel substitute. Administrative remedies are also not effectively available to Plaintiffs because Plaintiffs have a well-founded fear of retaliation by guards at JJJC if they file any administrative action. WHC claims that youth programs in WHC facilities typically include group and individual substance abuse counseling, family counseling, and in many cases, draw upon the resources of the community for additional programs.\n56. In the 14 months JJJC has been warehousing youth, there have been five wardens. Yet other guards are hired and retained for long periods of time when these same guards have convictions for offenses that should preclude them from working around youth.\n71. Such gassings are nothing more than a deliberate and intentional infliction of pain for the very purpose of causing harm. Upon information and belief, the injuries to the youth complained of herein are documented in WHC records and are well known to WHC and all other defendants. It is common for guards at JJJC to\n19\n\n\x0cgrab a youth and jerk him for the sole purpose of adjusting his place in a line. For example, WHC uses 4-point, and occasionally 5-point, restraints on mentally ill youth. Upon information and belief, at least one child in the November, 1999 incident was gassed directly in his face with a chemical which can cause severe breathing problems, burns, and scarring of the eyes. If the request is not honored, children go to great lengths - including slicing their arms and bodies and attempts at suicide - to avoid further assaults by other youth.\n101. As a result, Plaintiffs suffer unnecessary and excessive periods of lockdown.\n110. Where Defendants have conducted PZT investigations, there is evidence of bias in the investigations. Defendants’ fail to ensure proper management of medications as prescribed. WHC does not use up-to-date medications that can effectively control symptoms without the risk of side effects or abuse. WHC does not use professionally recognized tools to properly assess a youth’s degree of mental retardation and does not routinely maintain a roster that identifies those youth with mental retardation, despite evidence that a significant percentage of the plaintiff class has IQ levels in the retardation range. Program materials and disciplinary procedures are not adapted to youth with limited intellectual and educational abilities.\n131. Upon information and belief, the physician at JJJC has treated a youth with only one drug for this infection in violation of the standard of care. Upon information and belief, peak flow meters are not used to monitor disease activity even though the devices are available at JJJC and oral steroids are prescribed instead of inhaled steroids, which is not the standard of care for asthma. In lock down areas, security staff control access to medical care. Youth can be written up and punished for merely seeking sick call. WHC fails to provide hearing screening or adequate hearing examinations for Plaintiffs. However, upon information and belief, the physician has not referred any youth for further evaluation. As a result, Plaintiffs with hearing impairments have suffered harm.\nInadequate Dental Care 148. WHC further fails to provide an effective system of follow-up treatment causing Plaintiffs to suffer harm.\nInadequate Substance Abuse Treatment 150. There is not any vocational training or other systematic programming to occupy the youth. Defendants make no provisions to assist families to visit regularly. Consequently, Plaintiffs must regularly wear dirty, worn and/or ill-fitting clothes, sometimes for several days at a time. This failure is directly attributable to the indifference of WHC to provide for the basic needs of the youth in their custody.\n163. Upon information and belief, the laundry facility is of insufficient size to support a facility of 276 youth.\n164. Defendants have acted and continue to act in violation of the law, and Plaintiffs will continue to suffer irreparable injuries from the conditions of confinement at JJJC and Defendants’ policies, practices, acts, and omissions unless this Court grants the injunctive relief requested by Plaintiffs.\nKnowledge of Defendants: Deliberate Indifference 169. The conditions of confinement at JJJC and Defendants’ policies, practices, acts, and omissions complained of herein, constitute punishment and subject Plaintiffs to denial of due process of law, in violation of Plaintiffs’ constitutional rights under the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution.\nCount II 174. Defendants’ policies, practices, acts, and omissions complained of herein, and in particular Defendants’ failure to provide adequate psychological assessments, care, and treatment to Plaintiffs with mental illness, mental retardation, and other disabilities, discriminates against Plaintiffs and punishes them solely by reason of their disability, in violation of the Eighth Amendment and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, Section 504, and the ADA.\nCount VII 178.

FH-MS-0003,"On June 16, 2009, the United States filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi, under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. § 3612, against the owners and managers of a 98-lot mobile home park located in Gulfport, Mississippi.  The defendants leased lots to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to house persons displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. claimed, based on evidence from particular complainants and witnesses and on fair housing testing, that the site's management applied various park rules more harshly against African American tenants and members of interracial households, openly made racial slurs, declared that they didn't want any African American residents living at the park, and generally harassed and intimidated black tenants. The plaintiff sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, as well as civil penalties. The case was assigned to Judge Louis Guirola.

On November 15, 2010, the Court denied defendants' motions for summary judgment; the court found that the U.S. had produced sufficient evidence of discriminatory rule enforcement, racial bias, and harassment.  Though the case was scheduled for trial, shortly before that date arrived, the parties agreed to a three-year settlement on January 7, 2011. The agreement included a standard prohibition against discrimination, but it also included restrictions on the defendant manager in any future involvements in the rental real estate business.  These restrictions included regulating the conduct of the defendant-owner in the event it re-entered the rental real estate business, including notice to the plaintiff, fair housing training, notice provisions, non-discrimination policies, detailed reporting and recordkeeping requirements to allow plaintiff to monitor its compliance, and consent to periodic compliance testing. Defendants agreed to pay $45,000 in monetary damages to twelve named aggrieved persons, $45,000 to the United States, and a $5,000 civil penalty. The case closed on January 18, 2011.","['Case 1:09-cv-00376-LG-RHW Document 1 Filed 06/19/2009 Page 1 of 9\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI\nSOUTHERN DIVISION\n\nSOUTHERN orSTRrCT OF MISSI\nF I LED\n\nJUN 192009\n\nJ.

Barbara Hamilton told Maggie Johnson that she could evict them for putting trash in the wrong dumpster.\n12.

Prima facie case\n\nDefendants first argue that the Government cannot prove a prima facie case\n\nunder the McDonnell Douglas test as to each of the individual aggrieved persons. The\n\nGovernment responds that it is not required to do so and that there is a genuine issue\n\nof material fact as to whether a discriminatory pattern or practice existed.\n\nIn Teamsters, the Supreme Court rejected the notion that “the McDonnell\n\nDouglas pattern [i]s the only means of establishing a prima facie case of individual\n\ndiscrimination.” During this conversation Ms. Hamilton told Mr. [William] Batey [Reyes’s African-American boyfriend] that Homestead was better before ‘you people’ came here. . . . There is evidence that Mr. Hamilton told African American tenant Mitchell Jefferson “that his children should not play in the area at the front of Homestead after dark. Likewise, there is evidence that one of the Hamiltons told Rose Robinson, an African American tenant who resided with her minor granddaughters, “that children had to be inside after dark and children had to be supervised whenever they were outside. . . . Mrs. Hamilton testified that if the trailer itself was rented from Homestead, the tenant had to get approval from Chris Hebert, Homestead’s owner, before the tenant could attach a satellite to the trailer. By way of example, although the Hamiltons accused Batey, Reyes, African American tenant Charfonya Boose, Mr. and Mrs. Jefferson and their African American guests, Victoria, her fiancé Roosevelt Cherry, her niece Yvette Tucker, Mrs. Johnson and her African American guests Tomica Samuel and Tanishka Young of speeding, they deny driving over the park’s speed limit. According to Defendants, the rules allowed an eviction notice to be issued after three written warnings. Credibility is for the jury, not for the Court on summary judgment.

EE-IL-0075,"The Chicago District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against the Dial Corporation, who makes soap and other hygiene products, in May 1999, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  The suit was based on sexual harassment and retaliation claims in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The docket indicates that the parties had numerous discovery motions, mostly protective orders and orders to compel, and two individuals intervened.  The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted in part and denied in part.  The defendant filed an interlocutory appeal of that ruling, which was dismissed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

The terms of the consent decree included both injunctive and monetary relief.  Dial had to pay $10,000,000 into a settlement fund that was to be dispersed to eligible class members.  Because the suit was based on a general hostile work environment at the Montgomery, Illinois facility, the class was open to any female working at the facility before the suit was started, who provides evidence they were harassed.  If they are admitted by the EEOC to the class then they are eligible to receive a portion of the settlement fund, up to a $300,000 maximum for any member of the class.  The amount given to each member of the class is to be determined by the EEOC and the Court before the payments are made.  Dial was ordered not to retaliate against any person who complains of harassment and they are not allowed to harass or discriminate based on gender.  In addition they must rework their harassment policy and complaint procedures.  There will be three decree monitors who will provide assistance to Dial during this time and help ensure that they follow the required aspects of the decree.  All current employees and managers at the Montgomery facility must undergo EEO training, and all future employees must undergo it as well.  The decree included a dispute resolution policy to help avoid future court action; however, either party may seek court enforcement if the dispute resolution fails.

Bremiller, 195 F.R.D. at 26 n. 9 (“It is important to\n\nnote that the fact that incidents were or were not\n\nreported is irrelevant to a determination of whether or\n\nnot a hostile environment existed.” ( As discussed above, several class members indicated that they were subjected to harassment by co-workers on a regular basis. at 1075; see also Bremiller, 195 F.R.D. at 30 (concluding that where supervisors failed to refer sexual harassment complaints to the company’s EEO officer, as required by the employer’s harassment policy, the employer’s “complaint procedure was ineffective, [and it] could not legitimately rely on its employees to bring problems of sexual harassment to its attention for purposes of determining its knowledge”). As discussed above, an employer, once it has actual or constructive knowledge of a company-wide problem, must do more that simply address individual instances of alleged misconduct in order to avoid pattern-or-practice liability. at 887)); Bremiller, 195 F.R.D. at 29; Jenson, 824 F.Supp. See 29 C.F.R. §\n\n1604.11(a); Meritor, 477 U.S. at 65, 106 S.Ct.

""\nThere has been only one complaint since the Decree took effect that alleged sexual harassment. The Decree does not elaborate on this requirement, which raises two issues. In both situations, the wording of .39(c)(iv) seems to assume a formalized promotion process in which formal ""criteria"" are applied to candidates for promotion, whereas, like many employers, Dial has not formalized to that extent its promotion process for supervisory or higher-level management positions.\nWhatever Dial\'s techniques for such promotions, .39(c)(iv) clearly is intended to require steps to be taken to assure that persons known or suspected to have engaged in sexual harassment or related retaliation do not get promoted into these positions. ( Such discharges are often unpopular (some of the employees we interviewed were critical of this discharge even though they admitted to having no knowledge of what had happened), but they underscore the fact that management is serious about preventing sexual harassment.\nThe generally favorable views employees expressed about the current control of sexual harassment at the plant should not be cause for complacency. We asked a number of employees about the Hotline in our interviews and found no evidence of any distrust of this mechanism.\n¶39(b)(ii) required Dial to assure that complainants will be interviewed about their complaints in such a manner that permits the complaining party, at her or his election, to provide information in a confidential manner.

EE-TX-0273,"In May 2005, the Dallas District Office of the EEOC brought this lawsuit against JEA Senior Living, doing business as Pinehurst Alzheimer's Special Care Center, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging discrimination on the basis of race, black, in violation of Title VIII of the Civirl Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendant subjected the fourteen charging parties, female employees, by creating a hostile work environment based upon their race leading to either actual or constructive termination, and in one case retaliation when one claimant complained to her supervisors.  The complainants intervened in the lawsuit in August 2005. Following some discovery, the parties settled the lawsuit in December 2005 through a consent decree.

The two-year degree, containing promises not to discriminate, and requires the defendant to: provide a neutral reference for complainants, provide annual training for all Texas facility employees for two years, post notice of employee rights, advise supervisors of their duty to monitor the work areas and report harassment incidents, report any discrimination-related complaints to the EEOC, along with the actions taken, and pay $170,000 to be distributed among 14 individuals.

The decree was entered in 2005 and scheduled to last 2007.

All conditions precedent to the institution of this lawsuit have been fulfilled. The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 8, above, were intentional.\nII. Plaintiffs have been subjected to unlawful employment practices committed in the State of Texas, Eastern District, Tyler Division. Defendant is a company doing business in the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division. 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a). From that time on, white employees were systematically treated better than the African-American employees, including Plaintiffs herein. White employees were generally paid better than African-American employees. In fact, new white employees were hired at rates greater than the African-American employees. Defendant, through Administrator Bulman, also overlooked prejudice by supervisors. Another nurse referred to the Black employees as a “bunch of niggers.” Other employees have said that they do not like working with Black people and called them “niggers.” Black employees are also referred to as “you people” and “these gals.” One white employee even wore a confederate flag and was not made to take it off. Prior to Administrator Bulman’s arrival, most of the supervisors were African-American. Others were fired for pretextual reasons and/or reasons for which white employees were not terminated. Plaintiff Sherry Warlick is the sole white Plaintiff in this cause of action. When she refused, she began to be disciplined over pretextual matters. Plaintiff Warlick was ultimately terminated or, alternatively, constructively discharged, in retaliation for her opposition to race discrimination. Grant plaintiffs a declaratory judgment, declaring defendant’s past practices herein complained of to be in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 2000e, et seq., 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and 42 U.S.C. § 1981(a); 3. Grant plaintiffs immediate reinstatement, or alternatively, if reinstatement is deemed infeasible, front pay; 5. Defendants are subject to service in the Eastern District of Texas, Tyler Division.\nII Parties 3.

One nurse referred to\n3\n\n\x0cCase 6:05-cv-00162-MHS Document 17 Filed 11/15/2005 Page 4 of 7\nthe Black employees as “monkeys.” Theywerealso disciplinedor eventerminated for reasons that white employees were not terminated. Whenshe refused, she began to be disciplined over pretextualmatters. PlaintiffWarlick and PlaintiffHartsfield were not even allowed to be in the office at the same time together.

EE-NV-0004,"The Los Angeles district office of the EEOC brought this suit against Caesar's Entertainment, Inc., a major casino corporation, and related corporate entities in March 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada.  The complaint alleged that kitchen employees employed by Caesar's were subjected to ongoing and extreme sexual harassment, and were retaliated against for complaints about the hostile work environment produced by this harassment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Some of the complainants intervened in June 2005, adding various State law claims.  The parties settled the case in August 2007 by entry of a consent decree.  There are several published opinions: U.S. E.E.O.C. v. Caesars Entertainment, Inc., 237 F.R.D. 428 (D.Nev. 2006) (denying Defendants' Renewed Motion for Protective Order); U.S. E.E.O.C. v. Caesars Entertainment, 2006 WL 1168840 (D.Nev. 2006) (granting Defendant Pinelo's Motion for Summary Judgment); and U.S. E.E.O.C. v. Caesars Entertainment, Inc., 2007 WL 1231776 (D.Nev. 2007) (granting Defendant Hernandez's Motion for Summary Judgment).

The consent decree included non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses, required the expungement of complainants' employment records, and required Caesar's to provide neutral references for complainants.  Caesar's was required to work with an Equal Employment Opportunity Consultant to develop its non-discrimination and non-retaliation policy, to create a training program that would educate employees about discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, and to help develop and monitor the complaint and investigation process.  The decree, in effect for three years, also required regular reporting to the EEOC on complaints and on the non-discrimination and non-retaliation policy, which was to be distributed to employees and posted.  In case of non-compliance, Caesar's would have thirty days to remedy the problem, after which the EEOC would be entitled to ask the court to enforce the decree.  Additionally, $850,000.00 is to be paid by Caesar's to individual complainants and to similarly situated employees identified by the EEOC. The settlement term was three years.  The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2010.

The Parties’ Arguments The defendant argues that “the very nature of the EEOC’s request ... invades attorney work product and compels legal opinions and conclusions” and intrudes upon the attorney-client privilege. ( In addition, the defendant fears that should one of its corporate representative deponents neglect to set forth any facts upon which defendant’s affirmative defenses and responses and answers to interrogatories rest, the EEOC would use the deposition transcript to prevent the defendant from relying on one or more of its affirmative defenses at trial. Safety, 200 F.R.D. 459, 461 (M.D.Ala.2001) (“courts have the duty to pare down overbroad discovery requests under Rule 26(b)(2) ... The court should consider the totality of the circumstances, weighing the value of the material sought against the burden of providing it, discounted by society’s interest in furthering the truthseeking function”), citing, Sanchez v.

Burdensomeness [7] Having decided that neither the attorney-client privilege nor the work product doctrine prevent the proposed Rule 30(b)(6) deposition, the court must address defendant’s burdensomeness argument. See v. Durang, 711 F.2d 141, 143 (9th Cir.1983). Brooks v. City of San Mateo, 229 F.3d 917, 923 (9th Cir.2000).\n*3 In Miller v. Maxwell’s Int’l Inc., the Ninth Circuit addressed the issue of whether an individual has personal liability under Title VII. As mentioned previously, the evidence necessary to prove each set of claims is likely similar. Motion for Summary Judgment\nA. Legal Standard Summary judgment is appropriate only when “the pleadings, depositions, answers to interrogatories, and admissions on file, together with the affidavits, if any, show that there is no genuine issue as to any material fact and that the moving party is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.” Johnson, however, argues that this court should equitably toll the limitations period.

PB-NM-0001,"On January 7, 1999 several individuals eligible to participate in Medicaid because of disabilities and an advocacy organization for disabled individuals filed suit against New Mexico, the New Mexico Department of Health, and the New Mexico Department of Human Services in the United States District Court for the District of New Mexico.  They alleged that the defendants had violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Medicaid Act, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Specifically they claimed that the defendants provided community-based treatment to individuals with disabilities authorized as waiver services in a way that prevented disabled individuals from receiving these services in a reasonably prompt manner.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.

On April 24, 2000 the district court (Judge Martha Alicia Vazquez) granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss.  The defendants appealed the ruling denying their sovereign immunity claims but on August 16, 2001 the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Tacha, Pulitz, and Lucero) affirmed the district court.  On November 5, 2002 the district court granted the defendants summary judgment as to claims by plaintiffs who had since received the desired services or were deceased but denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the claim of the advocacy organization for lack of standing.  

Discovery proceeded until the district court (Judge Vazquez) granted the plaintiffs summary judgment on two counts and the defendants summary judgment on one count on August 5, 2003.  On February 4, 2004 the district court (Judge Vazquez) entered judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered the defendants to evaluate applicants for waiver services within 90 days and then provide them with such services when appropriate within 90 days.  The district court (Judge Vazquez) denied the plaintiffs motion to find the defendants in contempt on September 7, 2005 and found the defendants to be in compliance with the judgment on October 21, 2005.

","ALEX VALDEZ, Secretary of the Department of Health and Secretary Designee of the Department of Human Services in his official capacities, and GOVERNOR GARY JOHNSON in his official capacity,\n\nNo. 42 US.C. §1396n(c); 42 C.F.R. §440.180.\n4. Plaintiff Billy Jo Quisenberry is a citizen of the United States, a resident of Lincoln County, New Mexico, has developmental disabilities, and is eligible to participate in the federally and state funded Medicaid program. Her husband, age 79, is himself quite ill. Defendant Valdez is also responsible for ensuring that DOH operates in conformity with federal law.\n17. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding allegations as iffully set forth herein. See ANR Pipeline Co. v. Lafaver, 150 F.3d 1230*1230 1178, 1189 (10th Cir.1998) (citing V-1 Oil Co. v. Utah State Dep\'t of Public Safety, 131 F.3d 1415, 1421 n. 2 (10th Cir.1997)) cert. Scheuer v. Rhodes, 416 U.S. 232, 236, 94 S.Ct. In Blessing v. Freestone, 520 U.S. 329, 117 S.Ct. Therefore, the Court rejects Defendants assertion that the existence of a numerical floor defeats Plaintiffs\' claim that they should receive waiver services with reasonable promptness.\nThe second finding needed for an enforceable federal right is that ""the right assertedly protected by the statute is not so `vague and amorphous\' that its enforcement would strain judicial competence."" It states that medical assistance ""shall be furnished with reasonable promptness to all eligible individuals."" A plurality of the Justices in Olmstead explored the limits of the ""integration mandate,"" in particular the reasonable modifications regulation which provides,\n[a] public entity shall make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when the modifications are necessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of disability, unless the public entity can demonstrate that making the modifications would fundamentally alter the nature of the service, program, or activity.\n28 C.F.R. § 35.130(b)(7). Counts III and IV for violations of the ADA are dismissed with prejudice as to Defendants Valdez and Governor Johnson.\n[1] The Court must decide the Eleventh Amendment issue before reaching the merits of Plaintiffs\' claims under the 12(b)(6) motion because the immunity issue is a challenge to the Court\'s subject matter jurisdiction. 1598, 26 L.Ed.2d 142 (1970), but may discharge its burden by showing there is an absence of evidence to support the non-movant\'s case, Celotex Corp. v. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 325, 106 S.Ct. Thus, for State Fiscal Year 2002, the actual wait for DD Waiver services was 40 months, not 60 months as targeted."" Plaintiffs also argue that under Specht v. Jensen, 853 F.2d 805 (10th Cir.1988), experts may not testify on an ultimate issue of law. The Personal Care Option allows clients choice and flexibility in how their care is delivered."" Plaintiffs also contend ""[t]he facts are likewise clear and beyond dispute: the Defendants are not providing those services with reasonable promptness."" For this reason, Defendants maintain a Central Registry.[4] Defendants contend the Central Registry is more than simply a ""waiting list"" because it contains ""information"" regarding individuals already receiving services. The Administrator of CMS has the authority to approve or deny requests but must consult with the Secretary of DHSS before denying a request. In 2000, Governor Johnson requested $4.9 million for the D & E Waiver program and $18.1 million for the DD Waiver program; the legislature appropriated $6.7 million and $33.9 million, respectively. C. 1339*1339 Defendants construe this language to mean that the State is authorized to serve only the number of individuals for which the legislature chooses to authorize funding, up to 3,100 DD recipients and up to 1,950 D & E recipients.\nDefendants also dispute the number of individuals Plaintiffs claim are currently waiting for DD and D & E waiver services. C. Defendants maintain Arc of New Mexico advocated for this ""deferral option. Plaintiffs cite to Boulet v. Cellucci, 107 F.Supp.2d 61 (D.Mass.2000), Cramer v. Chiles, 33 F.Supp.2d 1342 (S.D.Fla.1999), Doe v. Chiles, 136 F.3d 709 (11th Cir.1998), and Boudreau v. Ryan, 2001 WL 840583 (N.D.Ill.2001), vacated in part sub nom., Boudreau does not stand for the proposition advanced by Plaintiffs. Id. at 78.\nNonetheless, the Court agreed with defendants that Congress intended the waiver provision ""to expand, not restrict, the horizons of what states may do in providing services to eligible people."" J. on Grounds of Legislative Immunity, Maruca Aff. ¶ In other words, Plaintiffs claim Defendants are not providing Medicaid waiver services to eligible individuals with reasonable promptness in violation of § 1396a(a)(8).\nAs previously noted, the CMS letters approving the waiver programs as proposed by the State in its waiver renewal applications state: ""The State will make waiver services available to individuals in the target group up to the lesser of the number of individuals indicated as Factor C for the waiver year, or the\n\n\x0cnumber authorized by the State legislature for that time period.""

Therefore,\nDefendants maintained the state legislature could limit the number of people served by making\nappropriations to the waiver programs in amounts less than necessary to fund the full number of\nunduplicated recipient slots shown in Factor C of the State’s waiver application. However, the courts that have addressed the issue of whether the reasonable promptness provision applies once the state determines an individual\n5\n\n\x0cCase 6:99-cv-00021-MV-JHG Document 254 Filed 09/07/05 Page 6 of 18\nis eligible for waiver services and a slot is available for that individual have found that the provision does apply. J. on Grounds of Legislative Immunity [Doc. Id. (emphasis added).\nBased on the language of the CMS letters approving the waivers, Defendants argued the federal government had authorized New Mexico to serve only the number of individuals for which the legislature chose to authorize funding, up to 3,100 DD recipients and 1,950 D&E recipients. Waiver amendments may be retroactive to the first day of the waiver year in which the request was submitted.\n7\n\n\x0cCase 6:99-cv-00021-MV-JHG Document 254 Filed 09/07/05 Page 8 of 18\n** ** ** ** ** ** **\nHCFA has allowed States to indicate that the total number of people to be served may be the lesser of either (a) a specific number pre-determined by the State and approved by HCFA (the approved “factor C” value), or (b) a number derived from the amount of money the legislature has made available (together with corresponding Federal match). L. Therefore, the State is required to\nindicate the total number of people who may be served and this may be the lesser of that number\nor the number derived from the money the legislature makes available for its waiver programs.\nAs Defendants pointed out in their brief in opposition to Plaintiffs’motion for summary\njudgment, “the legislative prerogative to cap the program by limiting appropriations also is\nembedded in state regulation . . . .” To help Medicaid recipients receive necessary services in a cost-effective manner, the New Mexico Medical Assistance division (MAD) has obtained a waiver of certain federal regulations to provide home and community-based services waiver (HCBSW) programs to recipients as an alternative to institutionalization. for Order to Show Cause at 2 (quoting February 5, 2004 Judgment). Finally, the Legislative Finance Committee also had to approve the plan. Hence, Plaintiff contends an unduplicated recipient slot in the D&E waiver program becomes available every time a person leaves the waiver program, whether through death, hospitalization, or for some other reason.\nPlaintiff is correct that the State may replace recipients who leave the program, but the State’s ability to do so is limited.

EE-TX-0372,"In August 2000, the Houston District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against Trinity Industries, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  We do not have a copy of the EEOC's complaint.  However, the intervenors' complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated on the basis of race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to promote the charging parties, Black employees, because of their race and retaliating against them for their complaints of the discrimination by negatively affecting the terms and conditions of their employment.  Two of the charging parties intervened in the suit in October 2000.  After some discovery disputes, the EEOC and the defendant appear to have reached a tentative settlement agreement in May 2001.  However, the EEOC and the defendant reached a final settlement in June 2001 through a consent decree.  It appears that the intervenors and the defendant did not settle until late November 2001 when they voluntarily dismissed the case.

The two-year consent decree between the EEOC and the defendant contained non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses.  In addition, it required the defendant to: post a non-discrimination notice, provide Title VII training for its human resources personnel, inform one of the charging parties of any job vacancies, fund six academic scholarships, distribute the consent decree, expunge the charging parties' personnel files from all references to the charges of discrimination, provide the charging parties with a neutral employment reference, and pay $60,000 to be divided between two individuals.

Intervenor Percy Simmons, Jr., filed a charge of discrimination on the basis of race against Defendant with the Texas Commission on Human Rights and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC"") on or about October 7, 1998, and amended thereafter, complaining of the acts of race discrimination alleged herein. On or about July 20,2000, Mr. Simmons requested and received a ""Right to Sue"" letter from the EEOC. Ms. Thomas has complied fully with all administrative prerequisites under the Title VII Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended.\nV. Intervenors are members of a protected class of individuals on the basis of their race. Regarding Percy Simmons, Jr., on or about June 26, 1998, a white employee with less experIence than him was hired into the position of Paint Shop Superintendent. Furthermore, Intervenor had been a supervisor for over two years and had not received any bonuses. However, similarly situated White employees who had committed similar or more serious errors were not reprimanded. Ms. Thomas refused to quit but was ordered to continue to work on the assembly line despite her safety concerns.\nAt one point during the production process, again as part of the practice of discrimination and retaliation referred to above, Trinity supervisor told Ms. Thomas and her co-worker that if they did not get a car out in 45 minutes, they would be fired. In the process of trying to meet that demand, Ms. Thomas\' foot and hand were crushed by the railcar, traumatically amputating both extremities.\nVI. 801 Laurel Street Post Office Box 26005 Beaumont, Texas 77720-6005 Telephone: (409)838-1000 Telecopier: (409)833-8236\n\nBy:\n\nWerner\n\nas Bar No. 00789720\n\nLawyers for Intervenors\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\n.

ID-CA-0005,"On January 23, 1985, four patients at the Napa State Hospital (NSH) in Napa Valley, California filed a lawsuit against the hospital and the Department of Mental Health for the State of California (DMH) in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging that their constitutional rights had been violated by conditions at the hospital.  This lawsuit drew the attention of the U.S. Department of Justice, who initiated an investigation into the conditions at the hospital on June 25, 1985, pursuant to 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1997, the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA).

On September, 13, 1990, the Department of Justice (DOJ) filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. &sect; 1983 against the State of California in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  The DOJ alleged that the defendants had violated the constitutional rights of NSH patients by failing to provide adequate medical and psychiatric care, inadequate staffing levels and staff training, inadequate status review for patients, inadequate record-keeping, inadequate procedures for administration of medicine, and misuse of bodily restraints.

On September 17, 1990, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California (Judge Eugene F. Lynch) issued a consent decree in the case.  We have no information on the content of this decree.  On June 2, 1995, the defendants asked the court to find them compliant with the court's orders and terminate the consent decree.  The plaintiffs did not object to this motion, and on June 8, 1995, the court (Judge Lynch) terminated the decree and dismissed the case with prejudice.

Bradford Reynolds Assistant Attorney General Civil Rights Division\n\nArthur E. Peabody, Jr.\nChief\nSpecial Litigation Section\n\nWe recommend the initiation of an investigation into conditions of confinement and treatment at Napa State Hospital (NSH), pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act, 42 U.S.C. §1997. It is operated by the Department of Developmental Services. The first was conducted in October of 1983 and the second in August 1984. Although presently on a second appeal, JCAH officials decided not to accredit the facility. In light of NSH policy to hold all incident reports confidential from the general public in addition to liaisons and conservators of patients involved , 4_/ the disturbing number of incidents that we have documented takes even greater significance.\nOn April 27, 1985, Marilyn Marie Conners failed to return to her ward after she and another patient were permitted out on the grounds of NSH under a ""buddy pass"" system. An autopsy revealed she was strangled to death sometime on the 27th. It has been determined that she was strangled by a male patient. Hospital officials have labeled this a suicide. ]_/ YLJ A patient was so severely beaten at the facility that he sustained permanent brain damage. _ It was reported that these patients were fighting previously, but were not separated by staff members. This fight was halted by other patients; no staff member intervened. Barbara Teyerl, April 29, 1985.\n£/ Napa Register, January 12, 1985; Telecon.

That staff member is still employed at NSH while undergoing psychiatric treatment. 20.1 Staff development was determined to be limited and failed to increase professional competence. 2k_l There are 250 penal code (i.e., forensic) patients in the facility, 25/ a number of whom JCAH surveyors found on every ward . JCAH surveyors found numerous deficiencies at the facility which pose a present danger of residents being trapped and consumed by fire. All but one building lacked a fire alarm system; 2. Large open wards in which patients\' doors do not open\ndirectly onto exit corridors; 6. 29_/ O n the night shift JCAH found i n s u f f i c i e n t and unqualified medical staff. Some ten days later Ms. Robinson was transferred to a local hospital with a 104-105 degree fever. ^34/ Another patient attempted suicide allegedly as a result of the inappropriate mixture of thorazine and other neuroleptics. 3jj/ Kristine Hamala, a patient at N S H , had diseases of the teeth and gum that were allegedly ignored by staff personnel. While in seclusion he was given no clothes, sheets or blankets and NSH staff continued to administer psychotropic medication despite David\'s documented paradoxical response. Mrs. Robinson, May 17, 1985.\n34/ Bedger v. Napa State Hospital, Civil Action No. These rights may be violated due to the existing pattern of violence against patients; inadequate fire safety and prevention measures; overuse and misuse of seclusion and restraint; inadequate medical care; and inadequate treatment and programming as is necessary to further the residents\' interest in safety and freedom from undue bodily restraint. The need for our investigation is especially great in light of the recent deaths at NSH over a short period of time.\nNotice letters as required by CRIPA are attached for your review and signature.\nU&fc Approved:\nDisapproved:\nComments:\n39/ Letter of Stephen and Nona Kaufman to Helen Gerling, January 15, 1985, quoting NSH staff member.\n40/ Letter of Helen Gerling, April 29, 1985.\n41/ JCAH Survey, pp. Please be advised that during the course of this investigation we will suggest that state officials contact appropriate officials at your Department to discuss and explore whatever financial or other assistance may be available to remediate any constitutional deficiencies which may be ascertained.\n\nWe will cooperate fully with your Department in this matter and will consult with you regarding the status of our investigation. i L i u 1 i O s c a r s J i r ^ u n n t no z-.e C t v r i i ..ii\'-.hcs o f i:M cicuciotvijLi.2vr:i i \' e r a o n : ? i i t ivi •, t a c.it-3 r - i c i l i c y . ; i c a r o ^ e c c t o cLai..iS or p a t i e n t v i o l e n c e ; iii.aao.;UHte ^\'i-iic-ni CM\\: ; • •. •;•..\': L-- i c ""cife ; : - ; [ • • : / . t : o f ri>?clu^io;; a n d r e s t r a i n t s . i c i a t i o n 0 1 t:>i-\'< 1•!\\Ta:>L i-i n t i o a i n ivo wav i n d i c a t e s a n y r>roj u a ^ . r c f.!!-it t c lor ; i r i - t i t s n a v e o o e n v i o i a c t > i . t r a n y v i o l a t i o n s ••r • t )••:""! c\\i:3 l n v ^ s t i .;ac i o n , i -..-i-s\'1. l-""!^\n-\'•^oor.is \'..:aoi!.>\n\n\x0cJ\n* i ; \' i ••••«•:,- vi..-. db) [Entry date 03/05/91]\nDECLARATION by Scott Erlewine on behalf of defendants in support of motion to dismiss amended complaint.

EE-IL-0106,"In August 2005, the Chicago District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against H and M International Transportation, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging that the defendant discriminated against the two charging parties and a group of similarly situated female employees in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by subjecting them to sexual harassment.  In October 2005, one of the charging parties intervened in the suit.  A few weeks later in early November, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss.  The second charging party intervened in the suit in mid November.  The defendant's motion to dismiss was denied in January 2006.  After some discovery disputes, one of the charging parties was voluntarily dismissed from the case in late June 2006.  Thereafter, the parties participated in a settlement conference in October 2006, resulting in a tentative settlement.  The parties entered into a final agreement in November 2006 through a consent decree.

The two-year decree, containing non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses, required the defendant to: revise and distribute its sexual harassment policy, post a notice of employee rights, provide Title VII training for all its employees, retain relevant records, report to the EEOC at specified intervals, and pay $150,000.  

The only additional activity that shows up in the docket is the notice to employees that the defendants were required to post as part of the consent decree. Since there appears to be no additional enforcement activity, it is presumed the case closed in November 2008. ","['F I LED\n\nLAL\n\nf\\lJG ;j U 2005\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n3.

EE-CO-0006,"In September 2005, the EEOC district office in Denver, Colorado brought this suit against the Acepex Management Corporation, an office janitorial service, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaints alleged that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating against a female employee because of her sex.  Specifically, she alleged that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a supervisor, exposed to degrading cartoons, and discharged for complaining about the assaults and participating in the police investigation.  The charging party intervened in the case. After extensive discovery and a terminated motion for consolidation, the parties settled the case and a consent decree was entered in October 2006.

In the consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would pay the aggrieved party $190,000 in compensatory damages and attorneys fees, refrain from retaliating and discriminating based on sex, issue positive references, implement an anti-discrimination policy, post and distribute its new policy, provide EEO training to ALL its staff, post an EEO notice, provide all employee postings and handbooks in Spanish and English, and submit semiannual complaint/compliance reports to the EEOC. The decree was valid for three years. The docket does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2009.

IM-KY-0001,"On July 18, 2007, attorneys for the ACLU of Kentucky Foundation, Inc. and private counsel filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of a lawful permanent resident living in Kentucky, challenging a Kentucky statute, §1 KRS 237.110, which barred resident aliens from obtaining licenses to carry a concealed deadly weapon. Plaintiff alleged that the U.S. citizenship requirement of the concealed carry law violated equal protection.  Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages.

Shortly after filing suit, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction, which the court granted on March 13, 2008.  The following month, the defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the action was moot because the law had been amended to remove the citizenship requirement.  On June 16, 2008, the court entered an order converting the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction.  The parties then disagreed about the awarding of attorney fees and costs.  In March 2009, the court granted attorneys fees and costs to the plaintiffs, but did reduce the amount requested.  This case was closed in May 2009.  



","Defendant John Adams in his official capacity as Commissioner of Kentucky State Police Headquarters is the Kentucky authority charged with issuing Kentucky Concealed Carry Licenses and is located in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\n4. As described on the Jefferson County Sheriffs website: ""NEW ! Must not have been convicted of certain criminal violations in the three years\nimmediately preceding the filing of the application. KRS 237.110(4) 2006 (emphasis added).\n17. Although the citizenship requirement was not to go into effect until July 12, 2006, Mr. Say was told by a representative of the Jefferson County Sheriff that he could not complete\n4\n\n\x0cthe requirements before that date and that his application would not be approved due to the citizenship requirement.\n21. Kentucky may not deny to any person constitutional rights under color of law. A declaration from this Court would settle this controversy. In the absence of an injunction, the amended statute requiring United States citizenship would continue to be enforced and would prevent Mr. Say from successfully obtaining a CCDW license. Mr. Say will continue to suffer irreparable injury if the Court does not issue an injunction. To the extent I have personal knowledge of the matters alleged in the Complaint, I verify\n\nthat the information is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge and belief.\n\n,2..3 .:;_o I 0\nI\n\n9\n\n\x0c', ""Case 3:07-cv-00377-TBR Document 4 Filed 07/20/07 Page 1 of 3 PageID #: 34\n\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT WESTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY\nAT LOUISVILLE\n\nALEXANDERM. This motion is made on the grounds that Mr. Say is\n\nlikely to succeed on the merits, Mr. Say will suffer irreparable injury unless the requested\n\ninjunction is issued, the requested injunction will not harm others, and the public interest will be\n\nserved by halting Kentucky's unlawful discrimination on the basis of alienage. This matter is now ripe for adjudication. For the reasons that follow, Plaintiff’s Motion\n\nfor Preliminary Injunction is GRANTED.\n\nBACKGROUND\n\nPlaintiff Alexander Say, a British National, is lawfully admitted into the United States for\n\npermanent residence. Plaintiff claims that other than the citizenship requirement, he fulfills all other statutory requirements to obtain a CCDW license.\nPlaintiff argues that the provision limiting CCDW permits to U.S. citizens violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. These factors are not prerequisites that must be met, but are interrelated considerations that must be balanced together.” Middleton v. City of Flint, 92 F.3d 396, 404 (6th Cir. 18 U.S.C. § 922(t)(3).\nDefendants have not satisfied their burden to show why this is a substantial state interest. 1998) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality)). 1992) (violation of the Fourth Amendment); McDonell v. Hunter, 746 F.2d 785, 787 (8th Cir. Protecting the ability of current CCDW license holders to use their license\n6\n\n\x0cin place of a telephonic NICS inquiry would impose additional administrative burdens on the Kentucky State Police. Under the facts before the Court, any harm to others caused by the granting of a preliminary injunction is not substantial enough to justify the violation of Plaintiff’s constitutional rights. A copy of House Bill\n\n639 and a copy of its vote history are attached as Exhibits 1 and 2. The Court’s preliminary injunction, entered on March 14, 2008, is hereby\n\nconverted into a permanent injunction. Plaintiff shall file his motion seeking an award of statutory attorneys’ fees\n\nand costs within thirty (30) days after entry of this order. Texas State Teachers Ass'n v. Garland Independent School Dist., Defendant bases this reduction on payment of historic, rather than current hourly rates. Geier v. Sundquist, 372 F.3d 784, 791 (6th Cir. The appropriate rate, therefore, is not necessarily the exact value sought by a particular firm, but is rather the market rate in the venue sufficient to encourage competent representation.” Plaintiff responds that Friedman played a significant role in substantively reviewing all the motions presented before the Court.\nFriedman’s time sheets reveal that the majority of his time was spent reading and responding to emails discussing litigation strategy and logistics. For these reasons, the Court finds that Plaintiff’s request of 32.5 hours for the work performed by Friedman is reasonable.\nB. Harrison Plaintiff requests a $300 hourly rate for 52.1 hours of work performed by attorney Jack B. Harrison. Harrison served as lead counsel for Plaintiff. First, Defendant requests a $50 reduction in Harrison’s hourly rate. Given Harrison’s previous litigation experience and relying on Tachau’s affidavit, the Court finds that $300 an hour is a reasonable rate.\nSecond, Defendant objects to discrepancies in the calculation of Harrison’s time sheets. Defendant also objects to time spent on media relations for FBT and the ACLU. App’x 415, 2004 WL 2756966, at *3 (6th Cir. Foster and Razzaghi are both associates at FBT. Foster and Razzaghi graduated from law school in 2005 and 2006, respectively, and are licensed to practice law in Ohio. First, Defendant argues that the hourly rates for Foster and Razzaghi should be reduced to $150 an hour to reflect the lower end of the Louisville market rate applied by the court in Elliot because Foster and Razzaghi have practiced for less than three years. Accordingly, the Court reduces Foster’s total billable hours by 14.1 hours (70.6 hours x 20%) to 56.5 hours and Razzaghi’s remaining total billable hours by 15.1 (75.4 hours x 20%) to 60.3 hours.\nD. Sharp Plaintiff requests $180 an hour for 17.7 hours of work performed by attorney William E.\n9\n\n\x0cSharp. Under the lodestar method, this amounts to $3,186 in attorney fees. of Realtors v. City of Euclid, 965 F.Supp.1017, 1023 (N.D. Ohio 1997) (compiling cases).\nThe Court finds that Plaintiff’s request for costs associated with computerized legal research is reasonable. 25 F.3d 1050, 1994 WL 252938, at *9-10 (6th Cir. Harrison billed 3.3 hours for reviewing and responding to emails regarding attorney fee issues. Razzaghi billed 1 hour reviewing emails regarding attorney fees.

EE-WA-0086,"In May 2001, the Seattle District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., d/b/a W Seattle Hotel, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.  The defendant allegedly subjected the charging parties and other similarly situated individuals to a sexually hostile work environment consisting of both verbal and physical abuse.  In addition, the defendant retaliated against several employees by further harassing them, resulting in the constructive discharge of some of them.  

In October 2001, five of the charging parties intervened in the suit.  In March 2002, the defendant made offers of judgment to some of the intervening parties.  Two of the charging parties accepted the offers, and the court entered a judgment against the defendant in their favor for a total of $200,000 in early April.  Later that month, the EEOC and the defendant settled their claims through a consent decree.  The remaining parties seemed to have settled with the defendant at a later date, voluntarily dismissing their claims in late May 2002.

The two-year consent decree between the EEOC and the defendant contained non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses and required the defendant to: obtain a sexual harassment consultant to conduct an audit of its sexual harassment policies and procedures, expunge the charging parties' personnel files of all references to the charges of discrimination, provide the charging parties with neutral employment references, develop a complaint procedure, provide annual Title VII training for all employees, report to the EEOC every six months, and pay $100,000 to be divided among three class members.

EE-NY-0020,"In August 2003, the EEOC's New York office filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York against Boston Market Corporation alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the EEOC alleged that the defendant subjected an employee to discrimination due to a neurological impairments (Asperger's Syndrome and Attention Deficit Hyperactive Disorder) and sex (female) by creating a hostile work environment that included verbal and physical abuse that resulted in the employee's constructive discharge.  In addition, the employee had complained of the abuses and received a cut in her hours and intensified harassment, which, the EEOC contended, amounted to retaliation in violation of Title VII.  Eventually the employee filed a police complaint against one harasser and, only after her employer discovered the harasser had used a false identity, he was fired.  

The employee intervened successfully in the lawsuit in February 2003.  Following much discovery and several settlement conferences, the parties reached an agreement in the form of a consent decree that was signed by the court in October 2005.  The decree enjoined the defendant from discriminating or retaliating in the future.  In addition, it required the defendant to create and implement a multitude of new anti-discrimination policies, create a toll free phone number to receive complaints, and create detailed mandatory training programs for all of its employees regarding equal employment opportunity laws. Pursuant to a separate settlement agreement, the defendant agreed to pay the complaining party $150,000. The settlement term was three years.  The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2008.

Boston Market Corp., Not Reported in F.Supp.2d (2004)\n\n*2 There does not seem to be a dispute as to whether the defendant is entitled to discovery from these non-parties. The dispute is, instead, about the mode of communication that the defendant can use to obtain discovery. City of Milwaukee v. Illinois, 451 U.S. 304, 313, 101 S.Ct. See National Abortion Fed’n, 2004 U.S. Dist. Different courts have come to different conclusions, as a comparison of the district court and appellate court decisions in the Illinois National Abortion Federation case demonstrates.\n*4 District Judge Kocoras, of the northern District of Illinois, held that the more stringent Illinois law was “activated” through HIPAA’s anti-preemption provision, which “demanded” its application, even though the case was before the court on federal question jurisdiction. As in National Abortion Fed’n, the C.P.L.R. section to which plaintiff points “remains the law in areas in which New York State has the authority to regulate, but it has not become the law in areas within the federal domain.” 45 C.F.R. § 164.512(e)(1)(v)(A) & (B).5\n\n5\n\nThe regulation does not appear to require a protective\n\norder when the disclosure is made pursuant to court\n\norder, although the language in some opinions suggests\n\notherwise. Id. Release of that information, the Law court suggested, can be made only pursuant to the methods set forth in the statute, and that ex parte communications in the absence of strict compliance with HIPAA are prohibited. 154 F.Supp.2d 388, 395 n. 4 (E.D.N.Y.2001). Boston Market has not cited to any post-HIPAA case that has allowed ex parte contact with plaintiff’s health providers by defense counsel, and this court will not enter such an order. Although the defendant states that Gagliardi has authorized private discussions between the D.A. and her attorneys (11/04/04 Letter at 1), but has not authorized such discussions between the D.A. and Boston Market, the court is not aware of any power that Ms. Gagliardi has to approve of or bar the release of information by that entity, and will not order such an authorization.\nIf the representatives of the D.A.’s office refuse to speak privately with defense counsel, the defendant can subpoena them for depositions. She specifically told BOCES that such authorization did not extend to Boston Market, unless is was rendered in a separate document. Regarding briefing schedule for motion to intervene.

DR-CO-0009,"Disabled prisoners incarcerated at the Denver County Jail sued the city and county, alleging it had discriminated against them by segregating them from the general population, denying access to activities and services, and failing to accommodate their basic needs.  

The plaintiffs filed their complaint on April 13, 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs were inmates at the Denver County Jail. Both have spinal cord injuries and use wheelchairs.  
		
The complaint alleged that the plaintiffs were segregated in the medical ward, despite no medical necessity, denied recreational and other activities because of their disabilities, denied access to religious facilities, the library, education, counseling, and other services and activities, and that the jail lacked accessible showers and other basic necessities.

The plaintiffs sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief. On March 3, 2011, the parties reached a settlement, the terms of which are not available. On May 31, 2011, the case was dismissed with prejudice.

Mr. Kyle is a Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition member. Due to an incomplete spinal cord injury, Mr. Kyle uses a manual wheelchair. Upon arrival at DCJ, Mr. Kyle never met with a classification officer. Mr. Kyle was placed there upon his arrival at DCJ. Solely due to his disability, Mr. Kyle was denied access to recreational, educational, religious, and rehabilitation programs, and denied access to the programs, services, activities, and benefits offered to other inmates at the DCJ who do not use wheelchairs.\n21. Rudy Salazar (“Mr. Salazar”) was held as a pretrial detainee, as well as post sentencing while waiting transfer to a federal facility at the DCJ in 2007 and 2008.\n22. Mr. Salazar is unable to walk and is substantially limited in several major life activities, including, but not limited to walking.\n23. Mr. Salazar was placed at the DCJ in December, 2007, experienced an extended hospitalization at Denver Health Medical facility for a pressure sore sustained at DCJ, and then returned to DCJ before being transferred to federal custody in July, 2008.\n24. Upon his arrival, solely due to his wheelchair use, Mr. Salazar was placed on the Ward. The Ward has several windows leading outdoors, but those are all covered with curtains or other materials. Individuals housed at the Ward have no view of the outdoors. While the Ward has a roll-in shower, it does not have a shower chair. Wheelchair users on the Ward were not permitted to purchase food or entertainment items from the commissary. They were only able to purchase stationary and hygiene items. Wheelchair users on the Ward were not permitted to attend religious services at the DCJ. Discovery materials in Mr. Kyle’s case filled more than 25 boxes. By the time he got his disk, accessed the computer, and loaded the files, he would only have 20 minutes of library time. The inability to access files hindered his ability to assist in his own defense.\n33. On information and belief, inmates who did not use wheelchairs were able to access a variety of programs aimed at enhancing the lives of prisoners while incarcerated. Defendants’ actions have caused and continue to cause distinct, palpable, and perceptible injury to CCDC. CCDC has devoted resources, which could have been devoted to its other\n8\n\n\x0cCase 1:10-cv-00829-WDM Document 1 Filed 04/13/10 USDC Colorado Page 9 of 16\noutreach, advocacy, and educational efforts, to educate members and others who have been injured by Defendants’ discrimination.\n42. Defendants’ discrimination has been and continues to be a barrier to the full participation of persons with disabilities and, therefore, frustrates CCDC’s ability to achieve full inclusion for persons with disabilities. Plaintiffs reallege and incorporate by reference the allegations set forth in this Complaint as if fully set forth herein. The City and County of Denver and its Sheriff’s Department denied Mr. Kyle and Mr. Salazar access to programs, benefits and services provided to other prisoners at the DCJ solely on the basis of their disabilities and for which they were qualified to participate in, thereby violating the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\n59.

EE-CA-0352,"On December 18, 2013, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC""), on behalf of a Muslim crew person, filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District Court of California under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 against McDonald's Corporation.  The EEOC sought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and prejudgment interest, claiming that the defendant discriminated against one if its employees based on his religion, Islam, when it refused to accommodate the employee's religious belief to wear a beard at work, resulting in the employee's constructive discharge.  

The employee began working as a crew person for the defendant in around 2001 and was promoted to Crew Trainer in 2003.  In July and August 2005, the employee informed the defendant of his religious belief of wearing a beard at work.  The defendant allegedly did not allow him to wear a beard and so the employee was constructively discharged.  

On December 19, 2013, the EEOC filed an amended complaint.  Also, on the same day, the District Court (Judge Anthony W. Ishii) issued a consent decree for two years.  Among other things, the defendant agreed to pay the employee $50,000, which was characterized as non-wage compensation for emotional distress.

The decree was entered in December 2013 and scheduled to last until December 2015. No further docket entries exist, so the case is closed.

PN-CA-0044,"This lawsuit, brought in the the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, was filed on June 3, 2020. The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the ACLU of Southern California. This lawsuit followed nation-wide protests that occurred in response to the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. While most protests were peaceful, some ended in violence, property destruction, rioting, and looting. Many cities, including Los Angeles and San Bernardino, issued curfews in an attempt to quell these riots.

This action challenged these curfews as violations of free speech and assembly, free movement, due process, and challenged the San Bernardino curfew as a violation of the establishment clause (the San Bernardino curfew included a provision that exempted attendants of religious meetings from the curfew.) The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief that would void the curfew and prohibit the cities from enforcing them.

The following day, June 4th, 2020, the case was assigned to District Judge Philip S. Gutierre and to Magistrate Judge Pedro V. Castillo. Judge Gutierrez informed the parties that he was part of a mandatory alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program and asked the parties to try to form an agreement before going to trial. 

On July 7, 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the complaint, citing that fact that the city had rescinded the curfews already and not attempted to reinstate them. The case is now closed.","Attorney Ahilan T Arulanantham added to party Kimberly Beltran Villalobos(pty:pla), Attorney Ahilan T Arulanantham added to party Black Lives Matter − Los Angeles(pty:pla), Attorney Ahilan T Arulanantham added to party Tom Dolan(pty:pla), Attorney Ahilan T Arulanantham added to party Lexis Olivier Ray(pty:pla), Attorney Ahilan T Arulanantham added to party Eric Jeffrey Stith(pty:pla))(Arulanantham, Ahilan) (Entered: 06/03/2020)\n2 CIVIL COVER SHEET filed by Plaintiffs Kimberly Beltran Villalobos, Black Lives Matter − Los Angeles, Tom Dolan, Lexis Olivier Ray, Eric Jeffrey Stith.

These added an exemption for credentialed press, but\n\n14 again no others. And on June 3, 2020, at around 1pm a countywide curfew was\n\n15 issued to go into effect from 9pm to 5am.\n\n16\n\n27. The order also includes only very narrow exceptions,\n\n25 including for travel to or from work.\n\n26\n\n29. Law enforcement officials have also utilized remarkably aggressive\n\n9 tactics against numerous protesters and residents since the curfew orders went into\n\n10 effect. It then organized another protest\n\n5 and march on Saturday, May 30, at Pan Pacific Park in Los Angeles, CA. That\n\n6 action began at 12pm and concluded nonviolently at 2pm after a brief march down\n\n7 Third Avenue.\n\n8\n\n41.

Ms. Beltran Villalobos supports her family in various ways, including\n\n22 by handling the grocery shopping and transporting her mother to and from her\n\n23 workplace, which is also located in an unincorporated part of East Los Angeles.\n\n24 Ms. Beltran Villalobos typically takes her mother to work and picks her up at the\n\n25 end of her shift, typically around 11pm.\n\n26\n\n53. Ms. Beltran Villalobos was also cited a few days before that, on May\n\n13 30, 2020. The police then placed her in a crowded van with other protestors and\n\n24 police. She had no choice but to sit in close proximity to other people while in the\n\n25 van, with no space to socially distance and no way to properly re-position her\n\n26 mask.\n\n27\n\n61. Mr. Stith’s work as a software engineer requires his undivided\n\n19 attention during normal business hours. He\n\n13 drove to that area and continually ran into police lines that LAPD officers told him\n\n14 he could not cross. The time was\n\n18 about 8pm.\n\n19\n\n75. When he\n\n2 recognized who it was, he told an LAPD supervisor that Samanta was a journalist\n\n3 and asked if he could go to the other side of the police line to speak with her. There were about a hundred people at this protest,\n\n22 which took place just west of City Hall on Spring Street, between First and Temple\n\n23 Streets, and it was peaceful. The most aggressive actions Mr. Ray saw at City Hall that day were\n\n10 taken by LAPD, largely threatening people with less lethal weapons. He understands that specific protests are scheduled and will last\n\n17 past the time set for the City and County curfews to begin. Mr. Ray is very concerned that if he continues to gather news about\n\n24 the protests and their aftermath past the curfews, he will be arrested by either\n\n25 LAPD or LASD because he does not have an official LAPD or LASD press\n\n26 credential. This concern is based on the clear language of both curfew orders that\n\n27 do not exempt non-credentialed journalists, his seeing a journalist colleague of his\n\n28 Samanta Halou-Hernandez cuffed and detained for a significant period of time by\n\n16\n\n\x0cCase 2:20-cv-04940 Document 1 Filed 06/03/20 Page 18 of 27 Page ID #:18\n\n1 the LAPD at the intersection of Eight Street and Crenshaw Boulevard while\n\n2 attempting to cover the protestors.

EE-NY-0146,"In January 2004, the New York District Office of the EEOC brought this lawsuit against SPS Temporaries, Inc. and Professional Personnel Management Corporation, temporary employment service providers, and two of their clients, Jamestown Container Companies and Whiting Door Manufacturing Corp., in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Specifically, the EEOC alleged that the defendants were assigning temporary employees based upon discriminatory requests for client companies, failed to employ persons based upon questionnaire information indicating the potential employee was disabled, and refusing to assign work to a temporary employee who was pregnant.  Following some discovery and several settlement conferences, the parties settled the lawsuit through a series of consent decrees tailored to each defendant in November 2005.  

The consent decrees ranged from three to four years of enforcement and contained anti-discrimination and retaliation clauses. It required the defendants to: make reports based upon complaints and make other compliance reports, keep records, allow access to the EEOC for monitoring, appoint a monitor, develop anti-discrimination policies, utilize objective job descriptions and hiring criteria, follow hiring protocols, comply with advertising requirements, post and distribute notice of rights to employees, temporary employees, and clients hiring temporary employees, provide annual EEO training, include Decree compliance with other criteria for managerial performance reviews, and contribute $580,000 to a Claims fund, to be distributed among an initial three complainants plus all other class members to be determined.

As there is no additional activity in the docket sheet, other than the approval of plaintiff's Class Distribution List, presumably the case closed completely in 2009.

At all relevant times, Defendant Professional Personnel Management Corp. has continuously been an employer engaged in an industry affecting commerce within the meaning of Section 701(b), (g), and (h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §2000e-(b), (g), and (h), Section 101(5) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C.§ 12111(5), and Section 101(7) of the ADA, 42 U.S.C. § 12111(7), which incorporates by reference Sections 701(g) and (h) of Title VII, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e(g) and (h), and Sections 1 l(b), (g) and (h) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. §§ 630(b), (g) and (h).\n10. More than thirty days prior to the institution of this lawsuit, EEOC Commissioner Paul Miller issued a charge of discrimination against Defendants SPS/PPMC alleging violations of Title VII. The unlawful employment practices complained of in ¶14 were and are intentional. Prior to institution of this lawsuit, the Commission’s representatives attempted to eliminate the unlawful employment practices alleged below and to effect voluntary compliance\n7\n\n\x0cwith the ADEA through informal methods of conciliation, conference and persuasion within the meaning of Section 7(b) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 626(b).\n25.

EE-TX-0057,"In May 2006, the EEOC district office in Dallas, Texas brought this suit against the Brookshire Grocery Company, a general food store, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.  The complaint was brought on behalf of a woman who had Hepatitis C and alleged that the defendant violated Title I of the American with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) when it subjected the complainant, a deli worker, to an unlawful medical exam/inquiry, demoted her, then constructively discharged her because of her disability.  

The charging party intervened, and all parties agreed to proceed in front of a magistrate.  The EEOC fought for and was awarded a protective order allowing the suit to be brought without identifying the complainant's real name.

  

In March 2007, the case was settled. In a consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would refrain from discriminating on the basis of disability, revise its ""Sick Partners"" policy, issue a neutral reference letter, expunge the complainant's employee files, pay the complainant $50,000, ensure that it was correct if it terminated anyone for having a communicable disease, post EEO notices, provide EEO training to all its employees, and submit a compliance reports.  No fees or costs were awarded.  The terms of the decree run for two years. The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2009.

FH-WA-0002,"On July 16, 2010, the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington, under the Fair Housing Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 3601-3631, against the owners, operators and managers of a 268-unit apartment complex located in Renton Washington.  The U.S. claimed that Defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of intentional discrimination against African Americans, Hispanics, people from India, and families with children by instructing staff not to show newly renovated apartments to them, steering them to less desirable buildings, demanding proof of citizenship, asking them not to speak to one another in their first language, requiring stricter application requirements, and refusing services. These behaviors were confirmed by testing conducted by the Fair Housing Council of Washington.

The case proceeded towards trial, but then settled on March 7, 2011, when the Court (Judge James Robart) approved a jointly submitted Consent Decree. Besides general non-discrimination provisions, the Decree prohibited the defendant owner from employing its manager in any position in connection with housing rentals.  It also required adoption, implementation, and notification to tenants of a Uniform Nondiscriminatory Procedure, and employee training on Fair Housing Act requirements.  In included provisions on recordkeeping, monitoring, and reporting, to facilitate compliance.  Finally, the defendants agreed to pay $85,000 for the establishment of a settlement fund for victims of the Defendants' discrimination and a $25,000 civil penalty to be paid to the United States.

The consent decree terminated in 2014, and the case is now closed.","['1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\nUNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT\n\n10\n\nWESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON\n\nAT SEATTLE\n\n11\n\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\n\n)\n\n12\n\n)\n\nNO.\n\nPlaintiff\n\n)\n\n13\nv.\n\n)\n\n)\n\nCOMPLAINT AND\n\n14\nSUMMERHILL PLACE, LLC,\n\n)\n\nDEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL\n\n)\n\n15 GRAN, INC., and RITA LOVEJOY,\n\n)\n\n)\n\n16\n\nDefendants.\n\n)\n\n____________________________________)\n\n17\n\nThe United States of America alleges as follows:\n18\n\n19 1.

EE-LA-0013,"In May 2005, the New Orleans District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against Jesohn, Inc., d/b/a Coffee &, Inc., in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Louisiana alleging discrimination on the basis of sex and pregnancy in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the defendant discharged the charging party, a female employee, and other similarly situated individuals when it discovered the women were pregnant.  The defendant also had a written policy that required female employees to take a leave of absence as soon as they discovered they were pregnant.  After some scheduling orders, the parties participated in a settlement conference in April 2006 and reached a final settlement a few months later in September through a consent decree. 

The three-year decree contained non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses and required the defendant to: develop an anti-discrimination policy and compliant procedure, distribute and post the policy, provide semi-annual Title VII training for its managerial employees and owners, post a notice of the decree, and report to the EEOC at specified intervals.  In addition, the defendant agreed to pay $26,000 to be divided between two individuals.

EE-MD-0099,"In September 2002, the Baltimore District Office of the EEOC filed this suit against RG's Food Shops of Pennsylvania, Inc. and Bedford Valley Petroleum Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, alleging discrimination and retaliation on the basis of sex in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the complaint alleged the defendant subjected the three charging parties, female employees, to a sexually hostile work environment, and reducing the work hours of and eventually discharging one of the complainants in retaliation for engaging in protected conduct.  One charging party intervened in the suit in January 2005.  Following some discovery and mediation, the parties settled the dispute in December 2005 through a consent decree.

The three-year decree, containing a non-discrimination and non-retaliation clause, required the defendant to: expunge complainants' employment records and provide them with neutral references, post and distribute notice of employee rights, provide EEO training, implement a complaint/dispute resolution process, send certain compliance documents to the EEOC, admit the EEOC to enter for monitoring purposes at the EEOC's discretion, and pay $105,000 to be distributed among three individuals and pending class members. The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2008.

","As alleged with greater particularity in paragraphs 9-13,\n1\n\n\x0cbelow, the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (“the Commission”) alleges that Defendants RG’s Food Shops of Pennsylvania, Inc. and Bedford Valley Petroleum Corporation (“Defendants”) have committed sex discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII by subjecting Lisa White and Mandy McMillan to sexual harassment and by reducing the work hours of Ms. McMillan and ultimately discharging her in retaliation for engaging in conduct protected by Section 704(a) of Title VII. The employment practices alleged to be unlawful were committed within the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Maryland, Northern Division.\nPARTIES 3. At all relevant times, Defendants RG’s Food Shops of Pennsylvania, Inc. and Bedford Valley Petroleum Corporation, both Pennsylvania corporations, have continuously been doing business in the State of Maryland and the County of Allegany, and have continuously had at least 15 employees.\n5.

EE-TX-0095,"In June 2002, the Houston District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against Dallas Morning News, L.P. and Belo Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the defendants allegedly retaliated against the charging party, a female employee, because she filed charges of race discrimination by disciplining her, threatening her, and eventually terminating her.  After some discovery and scheduling orders, the parties settled through a consent decree in September 2003.  

The one-year decree, containing non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses, required the defendants to: provide the charging party with a neutral employment reference, expunge her file of all references to the discrimination charges, post a nondiscrimination notice, and provide anti-retaliation training to the supervisors of the charging party's former work group.  In addition, the defendants agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of monetary relief to the charging party.

EE-FL-0032,"The EEOC filed this suit on March 27, 2003 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida (Tampa). Two complainants intervened in the suit. The EEOC alleged that defendant Checkers Drive-In Restaurants, Inc. violated Title VII by subjecting the two female complainants to sexual harassment resulting in a hostile work environment. The intervenors further alleged violation of a Florida anti-discrimination statute. The defendant filed three motions to dismiss and one motion for summary judgment, all unsuccessful.

NH-PA-0002,"The United States Department of Justice investigated conditions at the Philadelphia Nursing Home (PNH) in 1996 pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA).  In a December 19, 1996 letter to the mayor of Philadelphia, the Department of Justice described the unconstitutional conditions in the facility.  The facility failed to ensure the safety of or provide the most basic care to its residents.  Staff neglected residents and allowed them to reside in unsanitary conditions.  In 1994, the city had privatized the facility, turning its management over to Episcopal Long Term Care, and a previous investigation by the Pennsylvania Department of Health found chaotic conditions in the facility.  

The Department of Justice filed a complaint on August 13, 1998 against the City of Philadelphia and Episcopal Long Term Care in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The complaint sought to enjoin the defendant from violating the constitutional rights of PNH residents.  It alleged that the defendants had also violated the Nursing Home Reform Act, CRIPA, and the False Claims Act, and were unjustly enriched by funds received from the federal government.  

The parties reached a settlement agreement, which was filed contemporaneously with the complaint.  The City of Philadelphia and Episcopal Long Term Care agreed to do the following:

•	ensure that residents were free from mistreatment and neglect;

•	provide adequate psychiatric, medical, and nursing care;

•	limit the use of restraints;

•	allow a federal monitor to implement the agreement;

•	pay $50,000 for violating the False Claims Act; and, 

•	create a $15,000 fund to improve the lives of residents.

City of Phildalphia\n\nPlaintiff,\n\n™\n\nV\n\nHH HH\n\n• • • •• I\n\nNH-PA-002-002\n\nv.\n\nCiv. We hope to be able to continue to work with the City and PNH officials in such an atmosphere of cooperation and good faith.\nI. PNH IS FAILING TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF ITS RESIDENTS AND TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THEIR BASIC CARE NEEDS\nIndividuals residing in a state or municipally operated institution have a fundamental Fourteenth Amendment due process right to basic care and reasonably safe conditions. 457 U.S. 307 (1982); 42 C.F.R. §§ 483.13, 483.15 (residents have the right to be free from verbal, sexual, physical, and mental abuse, and corporal punishment; the facility must also provide a ""safe"" environment).\nThe facility\'s incident reports and special abuse investigations reveal a high level of injuries and dangerous situations that place residents at risk of harm. Virtually all residents we spoke to complained that PNH nurses failed to respond in a timely fashion to their calls for assistance. The City\'s November 1995 on-site review discovered PNH activities staff reading the newspaper, listening to the radio or watching television instead of engaging the residents in activities. In addition, PNH charts often lack consistent or appropriate diagnoses. The City\'s own on-site reviews document that the consult psychiatrist fails to consider important behavioral information contained in the nursing notes.\nIn addition, there is a general need for continuing education among the PNH staff at large with respect to mental health and psychiatric concerns among its residents. For example, the PNH physicians did not refer to a neurologist a number of residents who had drug levels that were chronically difficult to control.\nIn addition, PNH physicians often fail to adequately address residents\' anti-seizure medication where they have sub-therapeutic or above therapeutic levels. PNH must provide residents with sufficient, meaningful activities. PNH must ensure that bodily restraints are used only pursuant to accepted professional standards and that they are never used as punishment or for the convenience of staff. One resident felt that conditions\n\n\x0c- 4-\nhad improved somewhat since the recent arrival of the newer health care staff, but he felt that the newer staff members were inexperienced and not properly trained to care for the population at PNH. When the matter\n\ntion to address all those Issues In the hot, airless rooms.\n\nwas discussed with the staff... they\n\nfastest possible lime frame. The conclusion of the Monitor (as defined in § XVII of this Agreement) that Defendants are out of compliance with the Settlement Agreement does not in and of itself constitute noncompliance with the Settlement Agreement.\nC. Defendants shall comply fully with the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 e_L seq. , Consistent with accepted standards of practice, Defendants shall ensure that such data is incorporated into nurses\' notes and psychiatrist\'s treatment plans for each resident.\nD. Defendants shall comply fully with the particular provisions of the PNH protocol entitled ""Mental Health Services,"" attached as Exhibit 8 and incorporated by reference herein. The transfer or discharge is necessary to meet the resident\'s welfare and the resident\'s welfare cannot be net In the facility;\n2. However, the surrogate or representative cannot give permission to use restraints for the sake of discipline or staff convenience or when the restraint is not necessary to treat the resident\'s nodical symptoms. 274\n\n06-95\n\nPP-44\n\n\x0cTAG NUMBER\n221 \'222 :ont.\n\nREGULATION\n\nRev. 274\n\n06-95\n\nPP-50\n\n\x0cTAG NUMBER\n225 :ont.\n\nREGULATION\n\nGUIDANCE TO SURVEYORS - LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES GUIDANCE TO SURVEYORS\n\n(2) The facility unit ensure that all alleged violations Involving mistreatment, neglect, or abuse.

JC-IL-0038,"On April 1, 2005, a pretrial detainee filed this 42 U.S.C. § 1983 action against Will County and a Will County Sheriff in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, Eastern Division. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, asked the court for damages, claiming that the police and prosecutors of Will County had fabricated charges against him in order to extend his detention, violating his Fourth Amendment rights, and constituting malicious prosecution, false imprisonment, battery, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that a Will County Sheriff had entered his cell while the plaintiff was detained here, and struck him in the face without provocation. Defendants countered with a claim against the plaintiff for aggravated battery. The plaintiff was successful in defending against the aggravated battery charge at trial, and filed this action.

The Court (Judge David Coar) entered an order on July 17, 2006 dismissing the case because the plaintiff had informed the Court that the case had been settled. We have no further information about this case.

","That jurisdiction is proper with this court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. 1331 as this matter involves issues of federal taw.\n2. That at all relevant times hereto, the Defendants, Sheriff Paul J. Kaupas, and the Will County Adult Detention Facility, were departments of the Defendant, County of Will.\n7. That on said date, the Defendant, Steven Brooks was assigned to C Pod in the capacity of a Will County Sheriff.\n9. That all times relevant hereto, Defendant, Steven Brooks, was acting as an employee/agent of the Defendants, Will County Adult Detention Facility and the County of Will.\n10. That when Defendant, Steven Brooks, went to Cell 4 to talk with the Plaintiff, it was not pursuant to any County policy or procedure.\n13. That Defendant, Steven Brooks, opened up Cell 4 and struck the Plaintiff with a closed fist in his face.\n14. That said policy of enforcing physical assaults to cover up inappropriate and abusive conduct towards prisoners incarcerated at the Will County Adult Detention Facility was a deliberate act by the Defendant, Steven Brooks.\n19. That the Defendants, County of Will, Will County Adult Detention Facility and Paul J. Kaupas are in violation of implemented directives regarding Excessive Force, Official Misconduct, Abuse, and Discrimination.\n21. That the Plaintiff was detained by the Defendants for the offenses of aggravated battery and resisting a peace officer.\n24. That the Plaintiff’ s detention by the Defendants, deprived the Plaintiff of his rights, privileges and immunities in violation of Title 42, Chapter 21, Subchapter I, Section 1983 of the United States Code.\n26. That the Defendants, County of Wilt, Will County Adult Detention Facility, and Paul J. Kaupas, have failed to investigate, discipline, reprimand or instruct their officers in anyway for and because of malicious and unconstitutional actions of their officers, thus evincing a policy, practice, and custom of encouraging and condoning such acts.\n3\n\n\x0cCase 1:05-cv-01904 Document 28 Filed 07/20/2005 Page 4 of 11\n28.

That the Plaintiff was detained in the Will County Adult Detention Facility while this charge was pending and was subjected to isolation.\n25. Policy makers are aware of (and condone and facilitate by their inaction) a ""code of silence"" in the Will County Sheriff’s Department by which officers fail to report misconduct committed by other officers, such as the misconduct at issue in this case;\nThe Defendants have failed to act to remedy the patterns of abuse described in the preceding subparagraphs, despite actual knowledge of the same, thereby causing the type of injuries alleged here.\n30.

That the Defendants through their widespread misconduct, including the use of physical force, falsifying of police reports and criminal complaints, have caused the violation of Plaintiff’s Constitutional rights.\n24. That the Plaintiff’s physical abuse by the Defendants, violated Plaintiff’s right to Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.\n25. That the Defendant, County of Wilt, knew or should have known that Defendants, Will County Adult Detention Facility, Paul J. Kaupas and Steven Brooks violated the rights of those of whom they physically assault, including the Plaintiff.\n27. That the Plaintiff was physically assaulted without any lawful justification and caused the Plaintiff to be deprived of his rights secured by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the Constitution of the United States.\n29. As a matter of both policy and practice, the Defendants facilitated the very type of misconduct, thereby leading the Will County deputies to believe their actions will never be scrutinized and, in that way, directly encouraging future abuses such as those affecting the Plaintiff;\nVlll.

EE-NY-0031,"The New York District Office brought this action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, against Comprehensive Benefit Consultants. The complaint, filed in July 2004, alleged sex discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; specifically that Defendant subjected the charging parties to a sexually hostile work environment, constructive discharge and retaliation because of their sex, female. Defendant moved for summary judgment in February 2006 but the motion was denied in April 2006.

The parties entered into a consent decree in December 2006.  The decree, valid for three years, required Defendant to pay the four charging parties a total of $150,000 (individual amounts not specified in the decree) and enjoined Defendant from discriminating in violation of Title VII.  Defendant was required to provide Title VII training to its employees, post a notice of non-discrimination at its facility, and report regularly to the EEOC about internal complaints of discrimination and its compliance with the decree. The docket sheet doesn't show any further enforcement took place; the case was presumably closed in 2009.

JC-IL-0028,"On May 14, 2007, a female plaintiff filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, challenging the strip search policy of the Winnebago County Sheriff's Department.  Plaintiff alleged that she was arrested on an outstanding warrant for a minor traffic violation (failure to have a child car seat) and then transported to the Winnebago County Jail where she was strip searched pursuant to the Jail's blanket policy of strip searching all arrestees regardless of whether there was any reasonable suspicion that the arrestee possessed contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff alleged that the blanket strip search policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and class certification.  An amended complaint was filed on October 26, 2007.  

Defendants answered the plaintiff's complaint by generally denying all allegations.  

At the time of this summary, the case was still pending, and the parties were engaged in ongoing discovery.

","This is a civil rights class action brought to redress the deprivation by Defendants\n\nof rights secured to the Plaintiff and proposed class by the United States Constitution and\n\nthe laws ofthe United States of America. She was first taken to the South Beloit police station and then taken to the Winnebago County Jail. At all times relevant hereto, the County, acting through its Sheriffs Office, was responsible for the policies, practices, supervision, implementation and conduct of all matters pertaining to the Winnebago County Jail and was responsible for the appointment, training, supervision and conduct of all Sheriffs Office personnel, including those working in the Winnebago County Jail. In addition, at all times relevant hereto, Defendant Sheriffs Office, together with Winnebago County, was responsible for enforcing the rules of Winnebago County Jail, and for ensuring that Sheriffs Office personnel employed in the Winnebago County Jail obeyed the Constitution and laws of the United States and of the State of Illinois. Sheriff Meyers is made a defendant in this action in his individual and official capacities. Director of Corrections Doe is made a defendant in this action in his individual and official capacities. Plaintiff brings this action pursuant to Rules 23(b)(1), 23(b)(2) and 23(b)(3) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure on behalf of herself and a class of similarly situated individuals who were strip-searched without particularized justification upon their entry into the Winnebago County Jail. Specifically excluded from the proposed class are Defendants and all of their respective affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, employees or assIgnees. Plaintiffs claims are typical of the claims of the members of the proposed class. This action, in part, seeks declaratory and injunctive relief. As such, the Plaintiff seeks class certification under Fed. Common questions of law and fact exist as to all members of the class and predominate over any questions that affect only individual members of the class. Individualized litigation would also magnify the delay and expense to all parties and the court system. In the alternative to certification under Fed. P. 23 (b)(3), Plaintiff also seeks partial certification under Fed. The prohibition against strip-searching without particularized justification has been established in this Judicial circuit for several years, and with good reason: Subjecting someone to the indignity of a strip-search is only appropriate where there exists some particularized suspicion or cause to believe that the individual possesses weapons or contraband. As all members of the proposed class deserve to equally share in the assets of the Policy Making Defendants, the certification of a limited fund punitive damages class is appropriate, with the Court, after verdict, to establish this limited fund from the liquidated assets of the Policy Making Defendants and distribute the fund to all members of the class.\nFACTS 29. Ms. Raymundo\'s experience is representative. Plaintiff Raymundo was initially transported to the South Beloit Police Station and subsequently transported to the Winnebago County Jail. Two women correctional guards ordered her to remove her clothing. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and reallege each and every allegation stated in the paragraphs above. As such, Winnebago County and the Winnebago County Sheriffs Office are directly liable for the damages of the named Plaintiff and member of the class. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference and realege each and every allegation stated in the paragraphs above. The above-named Defendants were deliberately indifferent in the training and supervision of the individual corrections officers employed at the Winnebago County Jail, in that Defendants were deliberately indifferent in discharging their duty to make sure that any strip-searches conducted at the Winnebago County Jail were performed only in circumstances permitted by the United States Constitution. Despite this knowledge, the above-named Defendants did not act to stop these unconstitutional practices from occurring. A judgment against Defendant Director of Corrections Doe on Plaintiff s First Cause of Action for $1,000,000 in punitive damages. The parties jointly propose to the court the following discovery plan:\n\nA) Discovery will be needed on the following subjects:\nPolicies, procedures and practices in booking inmates at the Winnebago County Jail, specifically regarding searches.\n\nB) Maximum of 25 interrogatories by each party to any other party. Deposition of Defendant\'s expert shall be\n\ntaken by\n\n. Venue is proper under 28 U.S.C. 1391(e)(2) because the events giving rise to Plaintiff’s claims and those of proposed class members occurred in this judicial district.\nPARTIES 6. Upon information and belief, Winnebago County, the Winnebago County Sheriff’s Office and the Policy Making Defendants have instituted a written and or de facto policy, custom or practice of strip-searching without particularized justification all individuals who enter the custody of the Winnebago County Jail, regardless of the individual characteristics of the nature of their charged crime. As a direct and proximate result of the unconstitutional acts described above, Plaintiff and proposed class members have been irreparably injured.\nII: Demand for Declaratory Judgement\n\n\x0cCaCsaes:e3:30:70-7c-vc-v5-050080787DocDumoceunmt #e:n2t 113F-i2led: 1F0il/e2d6/1007/0P5a/g2e00173 ofP1a6gPea1g3eIoDf 1#6:86\n49.

EE-NC-0125,"In July 2003, the Charlotte office of the EEOC brought this suit against Pioneer Associates Inc. d/b/a Williams Electric Company in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina.  The complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated against the claimants by: 1) paying lower wages to female Flaggers than male Groundsmen, 2) refusing to allow female Flaggers to work storm trips because of their sex, 3) engaging in a pattern or practice of classifying female employees to Flaggers thus denying them equal opportunity for advancement, and 4) refusing to requalify female employees into the Groundsman position.  These actions were alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act. The case settled by entry of a consent decree in November 2004.  

The one year consent decree required the defendant to refrain from discrimination and retaliation, expunge the claimant's records, give the claimants neutral references, pay the claimants $29,526 in damages, modify its written anti-discrimination policy, distribute the policy, post notice, and give the EEOC semi-annual reports of any complaints of discrimination under the EPA or Title VII.

EE-WA-0029,"The Seattle office of the EEOC brought this action in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, against Howard S. Wright Construction Company. The complaint, filed in August 2006, alleged age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; specifically that Defendant had discharged the charging party based on his age (60).  In April 2007, the parties proposed a consent decree and it was signed two weeks later. 

The decree, valid for 2 years, required Defendant to pay charging party a total of 18,977.20 ($6,560.40 in back pay, $2,928.20 as a benefit contribution and $9,488.60 in liquidated damages).  Defendant was enjoined from discriminating, and required to provide annual EEO training to employees, post a notice of non-discrimination at its facility, distribute an EEO policy sheet to its employees, discipline any managers who discriminate and report to the EEOC annually on its compliance with the decree. Defendant was also required to provide neutral references for the charging party if asked by another employer. The terms of the agreement were to run for 2 years. The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement took place; the case was presumably closed in 2009.

EE-CA-0040,"The Los Angeles District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against the Beverley Hilton, which operates the largest hotel in Beverley Hills, in September 2001, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.  The suit was based on alleged discrimination of female applicants due to their age.  The hotel was not hiring qualified women to be waitresses at their restaurant because they were over 40 years of age.  There was very little action during the course of this suit.  Finally the case was resolved through a consent decree that was apparently reached through multiple conferences involving the parties.  This consent decree was entered in February of 2003.

The consent decree contained both monetary relief as well as injunctive relief.  The defendant was to pay $220,000 to an undisclosed class of women over 40 who had been adversely affected by the hiring practices of the hotel.  This class was to be determined by the EEOC.  For injunctive relief the consent decree required that the hotel train each of its supervisors, human resource people, and hiring personnel twice a year for the three year life of the consent decree.

EE-PR-0006,"The EEOC's Miami district office filed suit against Lupis Enterprises, Inc., the Puerto Rican parent company of the Lupis Mexican Grill & Sports Cantina, on September 30, 2004 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico.  The EEOC's complaint alleged that Lupis violated Title VII when it engaged in discrimination based on sex (female) against four employees, providing a hostile work environment, unfair scheduling, and retaliated against one of the employees when she complained by firing her.  Lupis filed a motion for summary judgment in September 2006 which was never resolved.  The parties entered into a consent judgment on December 21, 2006.  The consent judgment enjoined Lupis from future discrimination and required development of a policy against sexual harassment, Title VII compliance training for managerial and supervisory staff and posting of notice of compliance with Title VII.  The consent judgment further required Lupis to pay $55,000 in damages to the four aggrieved employees. The decree was to last for two years. The docket sheet doesn't show any further enforcement took place; the case was presumably closed in 2008.

EE-FL-0046,"In September 2000, the Miami district office of the EEOC brought this suit against Enterprise Leasing Company of Florida d/b/a Enterprise Rent-A-Car in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.  The complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated against the claimant by refusing to promote him because of his race (black).  The claimant intervened in the EEOC's suit in October 2001 adding claims under the Florida Civil Rights Act. After the defendant filed two discovery motions, it filed a motion for summary judgment in January 2002.  The court granted in part and denied in part the defendant's motion for summary judgment in June 2002.  After several other discovery motions, the defendant filed a motion for summary judgment of the intervenor's claims.  The court granted in part and denied in part the claimant's motion for summary judgment.  The case settled during mediation, and the court entered a consent decree in September 2002.  

The three year consent decree required the defendant to refrain from discrimination, provide training for all managers and supervisors on race-neutral promotion practices, post notice, keep records of any complaints of racial discrimination, and give the EEOC reports every six months on racial discrimination.

( Previously, in July or August of 1996, Akers told Anglin that he could not put in for any more promotions. 9).\nAkers once commented to another employee, William Westergom, that if you lined up all of the management trainees, Anglin just does not look like a manager. ( See Blalock v. Dale County Board of Education, 84 F. Supp.2d 1291, 1307 (M.D. Ala. 1999)(citation omitted)\nIn order to determine whether the continuing violation doctrine applies, courts consider, among other things, the subject matter, frequency, and the degree of permanence of the alleged acts. See Malone, 51 F. Supp.2d at 1301 (quoting Bell)\' v. Board of Supervisors ofL.S.U., 715 F.2d 971 (5th Cir. Even assuming that the Court found that the time-barred acts were related in subject matter to the timely filed claims, the Court finds that the time-barred acts consisted of isolated employment decisions and that the degree of pennanence resulting from Defendant\'s promotion decisions as to these three positions should have triggered Anglin\'s awareness and duty to assert his rights.

However, as stated above, Plaintiff has not put forth any evidence that the 55% or 52% CDW sales percentages were required in order to be promoted to the assistant manager position. Anglin met this CDW sales goal in March of 1995, August of 1995, January of 1996, and February of 1996. Specifically, Defendant contends that if Plaintiff is awarded back pay damages, such damages should be cut off as of February 28, 2001. Suite 2700 Miami, FL 33131\n\nMichael J. Farrell, Esq. Additionally, defendant asserts that because Anglin has not seen any mental health professionals, there is no possibility of examining medical records or deposing his health care providers to gain relevant information.\nPlaintiffand Anglin respond that the court should deny the motion because defendant has not met its burden as outlined in Rule 35(a), by establishing that plaintiffs mental condition is ""in controversy"" and there is ""good cause"" for the requested examination. 1995).\n\nUpon consideration, this court finds that plaintiffhas not made a claim of""unusually severe\n\nmental distress"", Stevenson, 201 F.R.D. at 553, which places his mental condition in controversy.\n\nNor has defendant shown good cause for the requested mental examination by a psychiatrist\n\nand forensic psychologist to explore his claim ofemotional distress. Suite 2700 Miami, FL 33131\n/ Peter W. Zinober, Esq. If a party fails to comply with Rule 26, the party does so at its peril. The EEOC and Anglin argue that their calculation for back pay damages is based on Anglin\'s personal knowledge of what he earned as a Management Trainee and the approximate salaries of employees at Enterprise with higher level management positions (approximately $50,000) and\nlPlaintiffs are reminded that a party that fails to disclose information as required by Rule 26(e) is not, unless such failure is harmless, permitted to use as evidence at trial, at a hearing, or on a motion, any witness or information not so disclosed. Rather, Plaintiffs\' claims are that Enterprise, throughout Anglin\'s tenure, ""consistently"" deniedhim promotional opportunities because of his race (Dkt. Enterprise asserts that this disclosure is also deficient. When Anglin raised this issue with Enterprise after the pending motion was filed, Enterprise took the position that the letters it sent to the EEOC in February and March 2002, before Anglin supplemented his responses on April 22, 2002, were sufficient to satisfy Local Rule 3.01(g).\nThis court also finds that Enterprise did not comply with Local Rule 3.01(g). At that time, Akers told Anglin that he could not be promoted because he did not have a dynamic presence-that if they lined up every employee in the office and no one was allowed to say a word and a customer walked in and was asked who they thought the branch manager was, the customer would never choose Anglin.2 Id. at 137. The 12 week probationary period consisted of Mary Mortensen, Anglin\'s branch\nmanager, meeting with Anglin weekly to review his performance in ten specified areas. See Rice-Lamar v.

EE-NY-0025,"The EEOC's New York district office sued BWD Group, Limited, on May 8, 1997 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, for violation of Title VII. The complaint alleged that defendant discriminated against its female employees on the basis of sex and did so through the creation of a hostile work environment.  The complaint additionally alleged that defendant retaliated against employees who complained of harassment, retaliated against employees who cooperated with the EEOC, and engaged in constructive discharge.

The parties entered into a three year consent decree on June 9, 1998. This decree required the defendant to: expunge the records of the charging parties, provide neutral references to the charging parties, attempt to identify all potential claimants, pay $1,200,000 to claimants, distribute its non-discrimination policy to all employees, post a notice of EEO rights, and to provide training to all employees.

DR-CO-0019,"On December 31, 1996 a law student who used a wheelchair for mobility sued the University of Denver in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, Chief Judge Richard P. Matsch.  The Plaintiff claimed that numerous architectural and other barriers to accessibility prevented him from full participation as a student in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794; and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq. 

Specifically, Plaintiff claimed that he encountered automatic doors which did not open, elevators that did not work, transportation available to students but without disabled access, and classroom configurations that segregated him in the back of the room. He sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief. 

 

On July 21, 1998, the court granted a stipulated motion to dismiss with prejudice, with each party bearing its own costs and attorneys' fees.  There is no settlement agreement or other similar document available in this case.

","[""IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLORADO\n\nCivil Action No. Defendant University of Denver is a corporation incorporated in the state of Colorado. As such, he will likely continue to experience discrimination in these locations.\n11. In addition, College of Law policies -- for example, those concerning shut-down of elevators and automatic doors -- discriminate against Mr. Williams on the basis of disability in his attempt to participate in the benefits and services of the College of Law. The University provides a regular transportation service between the Park Hill campus and the main campus. -6-\n\n\x0cWith respect to the programs and activities of the College of Law conducted during the time Mr. Williams was a student, Defendant has not met these standards.\n15. He has spent many hours over this time meeting with representatives of the University to discuss these violations. Plaintiff realleges and incorporates by reference the allegations set forth in paragraphs 1 - 19 above as if fully set forth herein. Plaintiff Kevin Williams has been, continues to be and will in the future be, damaged by the architectural and other barriers, policies and conduct described above.\nSECOND CLAIM FOR RELIEF (Violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act) 25. Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by any person who owns, leases (or leases to) or operates a place of public accommodation. Public accommodations covered by Title III include auditoriums, lecture halls or other places of public gathering, undergraduate and postgraduate schools or other places of education. and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq.; That this Court award reasonable fees and costs to Plaintiff's attorneys; 36. As\n\n-4-\n\n\x0cto the remainder of the issues in this case, Plaintiff’s Amended Complaint alleges discrimination actionable under § 504 and the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., He graduated on December 20, 1996, took the bar examination on February 26 and 27 and plans -- upon the receipt of a passing score -- to practice law in Denver. 25-35.\nMost of the College of Law’s student organizations are located in an inaccessible part of Foote Hall and for much of Mr. Williams’s time at the College of Law, the school held events in other inaccessible parts of Foote Hall. He sat in segregated classrooms or in a segregated part of Davis Auditorium and at one point was locked out in below-freezing weather and had to wait for a non-disabled person to come along because the school had turned off the automatic doors before it had locked the manual doors. The letter also informed Mr. Williams that, as a new graduate, he was automatically enrolled as a member of the Alumni Association and that the benefits included free library privileges for the first five years after graduation and use of the DU Career Service Office for as long as he practices.\n-7-\n\n\x0cWilliams Aff. Mr. Williams intends to return to the school to use the library and Career Service Office and will be attending the spring commencement to watch his friends graduate. Defendant does not challenge the first, second or fourth of these elements, but appears to argue that the treatment Mr. Williams received did not constitute discrimination solely based on his handicap.\nDiscrimination prohibited under § 504 is described in detail in its implementing regulations. While the regulations specify that one type of impermissible disability discrimination is discrimination through inaccessible facilities, see 34 C.F.R. § 104.21, the language of the statute itself and of 34 C.F.R. § 104.4(b)(1) is much broader, reaching provision of unequal services, segregation and harassment of the type encountered by Mr. Williams.\n1. This institution-wide application was thus the law at the time LTLB was built in 1982.2\n\n2\n\nThe regulation Defendant cites to support its position to the contrary is part of the\n\nguidelines for accessible design of parks, forests and public property, see 36 C.F.R. § 1190.2, cited in\n\nDef. The student organizations, a program or activity conducted almost exclusively in Foote Hall, is not, when viewed in its entirety, even remotely accessible to people with disabilities nor is it offered in an integrated setting. Sweatt v. Painter, 339 U.S. 629, 634 (1950).\n-14-\n\n\x0cWhile Mr. Williams was not segregated to a separate campus, as the Black law students were in Sweatt, the segregation that existed at the College of Law provided him far less access to faculty, administration and alumni than non-disabled students received. of Agriculture, 998 F.2d 824 (10th Cir.), In addition, it is a violation of § 504 to fail to provide a disabled student with a roommate, Coleman v. Zatechka, 824 F. Supp. ”\nAs is the case with § 504, the ADA covers far more than just architecture. Plaintiff has stated a claim under the ADA. Any appropriate remedy” is not limited to\ncompensatory damages and Congress has not expressly disallowed punitive damages under § 504.\nWhere, as here, a defendant has acted intentionally or with reckless or callous disregard for the\nplaintiff’s civil rights, punitive damages may be appropriate.\nA number of courts have held, based on Franklin, that punitive damages are available under\n§ 504. 95\nC 7341, 1996 WL 411319 at *3-4 (N.D. Ill. July 19, 1996)(Attachment 1 hereto); DeLeo v. City of\nStamford, 919 F. Supp. Plaintiff has standing to bring claims for injunctive relief and these claims are not moot or unripe.\nThe constitutional and prudential doctrines of standing, mootness and ripeness serve to ensure that federal courts do not offer advisory opinions but rather resolve live controversies brought by those actually injured at a point when the relief requested can affect the conduct or condition complained of. As such, Defendant’s allegation that it would accommodate Plaintiff’s disability in any future teaching job is impossible.\nDefendant’s assertion that “alumni activities are only held in accessible locations,” Lynch Aff. ¶ at 21 (emphasis added), is equivalent to a segregated restaurant claiming that a prospective Black patron has no standing because he doesn’t “need” to dine at the restaurant. In public accommodations cases, standing -- a jurisdictional issue which may be raised by the court sua sponte, Aikins v. St. Helena Hosp., 42 U.S.C. § 12188(a)(1).\n\n9\n\nSee, e.g., Staron v. McDonald’s Corp., 51 F.3d 353 (2d Cir. 1522 (M.D. Fla. 1990)\n\n(disabled plaintiffs stated claim against city for building stadium with segregated seating).\n\n-27-\n\n\x0cDefendant’s standing argument boils down to the assertion that it is not likely, under Defenders and Lyons, that Mr. Williams will use the facilities at the College of Law. These cases are readily distinguishable on their facts. By the time the Supreme Court heard oral argument, he was in his final quarter at the defendant law school and the school promised not to obstruct his graduation. Comm’rs v. Jacobs, 420 U.S. 128, 129 (1975) (challenge to rules governing school newspaper mooted by plaintiffs’ graduation); Doe v. Marshall, 622 F.2d 118, 119 (5th Cir. v. Sonoma County, 905 F.2d 1287, 1290-91 (9th Cir. 94-0029-D, 1994 WL 791708 at *2 (W.D. Va. Sept. 23, 1994) (Attachment 6 hereto). See Howard v. Cherry Hills Cutters, Inc., 935 F. Supp. Kirchner v. Chattanooga Choo Choo, 10 F.3d 737, 738-39 (10th Cir. ”)14 Courts around the\ncountry have reached the same result. denied 467 U.S. 1252\n(1983); Miener v. State of Mo., 673 F.2d 969, 978 (8th Cir.), This argument\nmust be rejected because, as set forth above, Title III does not require plaintiff to exhaust his administrative remedies.15\n14 In addition, 29 U.S.C. § 794a(a)(2) provides that the remedies and procedures of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 apply to actions brought under § 504, and there is no exhaustion requirement under Title VI.

EE-IL-0082,"In September 2003, the Chicago District Office of the EEOC filed this lawsuit against Fifth Third Bank in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois alleging discrimination on the basis of sex, female, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendant exposed complainants to a sexually hostile work environment, culminating in the constructive discharge of some parties.  The complainant intervened in the case in October 2003 and withdrew it in May 2004.  Following discovery, the parties settled the dispute in July 2004 through a consent decree.

The two-year decree, containing anti-discrimination and retaliation clauses, required the defendant to: report to the EEOC regarding complaints about sexual harassment, keep records of defendant's implementation of the consent decree, permit access to the EEOC under certain circumstances, post notice of employee rights, provide EEO training to managers and supervisors, and pay $225,000 to be distributed among four individuals.

Following her complaints regarding the unwanted and offensive behavior, Collander nlkla Spillane was sUbjected to adverse reprisals including probationary status.\n10. That in or around March, 2002 Intervenor was constructively discharged from her employment.\nCOUNT I\nSEXUAL HARASSMENT Intervenor restates and realleges paragraphs I through 10 above as though fully set forth herein. That the aforesaid treatment ofIntervenor was because of her sex, female, in violation of Title VII, as amended. Intervenor has suffered and will continue to suffer irreparable lllJUry caused by defendant\'s illegal conduct. As a result of the acts complained of herein, Intervenor has suffered and will continue to suffer the effects of unlawful discrimination, extreme emotional distress and mental anguish, loss of career opportunities, loss of a job, damage to Intervenor\'s reputation and professional development, and other compensable losses and damage.\n4\n\n\x0c16. An Order that defendant pay for an award to compensate Intervenor for her pain and suffering and for the humiliation caused the defendant\'s unlawful treatment in an amount to be determined at trial;\ne. The conduct of the defendant constitutes unlawful employment discrimination on the basis of sex and constitutes a violation of the Intervenor\'s rights\npursuant to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 as amended by Title VII of the Civil\nRights Act of 1991, and the defendant is liable to the Intervenor for civil relief and other\ndamages for the violation ofIntervenor\'s rights.\nWHEREFORE, Intervenor, CARRIE COLLANDER nlkla CARRIE SPILLANE, respectfully requests that this Court:\na. Fifth Third is directed\n\nto answer the remaining allegations of the complaint within seven days of this order.\n\n• (11)\n\n[For further detail see order attached to the original minute ordeL]\n\nNo notices required, advised in open court.\n\nNo notices required.\n\nNotices mailed by judge\'s staff. In November 2003, Spillane intervened in the case as a plaintiff, including in her complaint a claim of constructive discharge.\nDiscussion Before a private plaintiff can file suit under Title VII, she must exhaust administrative remedies by filing a charge with the EEOC. lfthe EEOC, during that investigation, uncovers discriminatory conduct not identified in the original charge, it may include that conduct in a civil suit against the employer. Although it found that one of the charges had no merit, during the course of its investigation it discovered that GE had engaged in sex discrimination. 1992), a female employee filed a charge alleging that she had been demoted from a managerial position to an assistant sales position because she was a woman. When the EEOC investigated her charge, it uncovered evidence that her employer had made her work conditions unbearable and had paid her significantly less than her male colleagues for similar work. ! Accord, EEOC v. Brookhaven Bank & Trust Co., 613 F.2d 1022, 1024 (5th Cir. 1980) (""... it is obvious that the civil action is much more intimately related to the EEOC investigation than to the words of the charge which originally triggered the investigation""); EEOC v. Huttig Sash & Door Co., 511 F.2d 453 (5th Cir. 1975) (even when an employee settles with the employer, the EEOC has the right to pursue a lawsuit to correct discrimination discovered through the investigation that was not alleged in the charge.)\nThough the Seventh Circuit has not squarely addressed this point, this court believes that it would follow the Fourth, Fifth, and Eighth Circuits if called upon to do so. \nThe EEOC\'s constructive discharge allegations meet the test set forth in Gen\'l Electric and the other decisions discussed above. 6\n\n\x0ccomplaint within seven days of this order.

EE-TX-0459,"The San Antonio office of the EEOC brought this suit against U.S. Contractors, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas in July 2003.  The complaint alleged discrimination against female employees in violation of Title VII.  More specifically, the complaint alleged that female employees were subjected to sexual harassment from male employees, were disparately discharged, and were subjected to retaliatory demotion.

On August 18, 2003, a motion to consolidate the case V-03-81 (Clearinghouse: EE-TX-0391) with this case was granted by Judge John D. Rainey. Griffin v. Formosa plastics was designated the lead case.

On December 22, 2004 the court (Judge Rainey) approved a consent decree in favor of the plaintiffs.  The six female employees were awarded a total of $530,000. The three year decree also called for injunctive relief in the form of anti-discrimination and retaliation policies, a modified sexual harassment policy, an employee training program and the required posting of applicable laws/policies related to sexual harassment.

On or about January 26, 2000 she was promoted to foreman and given a raise to $14.49 per hour working approximately 40 hours per week. Even after her promotion, Mr. Rodriguez\'s inappropriate conduct continued. In mid February, Mr. Rodriguez grabbed her butt and made comments about her big butt. On or about March 7th, she was informed by Joe Frank Rodriguez that she was being bumped down for Cody O\'Neill. Sometime around March 12th or 14th, she complained to Speedy Wells again and told him that she was being treated differently because she was a woman. On or about March 25th she was terminated.

She complained to him that she was being discriminated against, but he still would not let her do certain jobs because there were too many men.

PC-NJ-0021,"On October 20, 2006, state prisoners at New Jersey's Adult Diagnostic & Treatment Center (""ADTC"") filed this §1983 suit against officials associated with ADTC in the District Court for New Jersey, alleging violations of their 8th and 14th amendment rights.  Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that officials associated with the facility violated their constitutional rights by failing to contain and treat a serious and contagious skin condition.  Plaintiffs sought compensatory and injunctive relief, and moved to certify a class of all similarly situated persons.

On January 25, 2007, the Court (Judge Stanley R. Chesler) dismissed thirteen of the prisoners sua sponte, with leave to file amended individual complaints, after concluding he was not authorized to join their matters together.  The Court also denied class certification.

On June 19, 2009, the 3rd Circuit reversed the categorical denial of joinder, vacated the denial of class certification for failure to adequately justify the denial, and remanded to the lower court for further proceedings.

The prisoners requested IFP status and applied for the appointment of counsel.\nBefore Defendants had been served, the District Court issued an order sua sponte on January 25, 2007, dismissing without prejudice all Plaintiffs, except Lewis Hagan, upon concluding that permissive joinder was unavailable to IFP prisoner litigants. Frederico v. Home Depot, 507 F.3d 188, 192 (3d Cir. 1991), elected to stand on their dismissed claims after they renounced, by letter briefs filed with this Court, any intention to reinstitute proceedings against the defendants at issue. Respondents argue that collecting full fees from multiple joint litigants to comply with § 1915(b)(1) would conflict with § 1915(b)(3), which provides, “In no event shall the filing fee collected exceed the amount of fees permitted by statute for the commencement of a civil action or an appeal of a civil action or criminal judgment.” § However, the court stated:\nIt does not follow that § 1915 has superseded Rule 20. As the Seventh Circuit\n18\n\n\x0creasoned, taking “§ 1915(b)(1) at face value,” the requirement for each prisoner to pay a full fee is simply one price that a prisoner must pay for IFP status under the PLRA. Nothing in § 1915(b) mentions joinder or indicates that Congress intended § 1915(b)(3) to serve as a bar to the collection of multiple individual fees from individual plaintiffs in a joint litigation.3 Reading the PLRA as requiring each joined IFP litigant to pay a full individual filing fee by installment, and no more, harmonizes the PLRA with Rule 20, and internally harmonizes the various provisions of § 1915(b).\nWe are merely called upon in this case to determine how two laws should operate together. For instance, there is no evidence that the prisoners had any difficulty securing all of the required signatures on the pleadings and the filings related to this appeal. Group, Ltd. v. Colkitt, 259 F.3d 135, 142 n.7 (3d Cir. In Hassine v. Jeffes, 846 F.2d 169 (3d Cir. Conclusion\nThe District Court’s order denying joinder to the Appellants was based on an erroneous conclusion of law and will be REVERSED. I therefore agree that the District Court should not have denied class certification at this stage, and I concur in the judgment to that limited extent, though that does not imply that class certification must be granted, nor does it say anything about who, if anyone, could properly serve as class representative. 1.)\n10Viewing §§ 1915(b)(3) and (4) as directed to an individual prisoner’s ability to initiate an action, as suggested in Judge Rendell’s opinion, supports the conclusion that the PLRA was\n(continued...)\n33\n\n\x0cI am, however, unable to agree with Judge Roth’s resolution of the fees conundrum because it appears incompatible with the plain language of the PLRA. Under the latter rule, before there is a consolidation there are, by definition, separate actions, for each of which a filing fee is paid and each of which must stand on its own merit. Hawaii v. Office of Hawaiian Affairs, 129 S.Ct. Thus, even though joinder under Rule 20 is not prohibited by the PLRA, I am unable to agree with the Majority’s conclusion that the District Court was wrong to deny the motion for joinder in this case.\nThe District Court’s well-reasoned opinion identifies several issues that deserve greater respect than we have given\n37\n\n\x0cthem. See Docket 12/24/08 and 1/09/2009 letters from the Clerk of the Third Circuit to the ADTC (seeking forwarding information for released and deceased inmates for purposes of notification of oral argument).\n39\n\n\x0cPerhaps of greatest concern is the addition of a new subject for intimidation and coercion within the prison setting. Climbing onboard a complaint about prison conditions may seem like an excellent idea when the alternative is presented by a fellow inmate with a record for assault.\nThe concerns behind the District Court’s decision are not a fanciful parade of horribles.

EE-CA-0079,"In September 2003, the Los Angeles District Office of the EEOC filed this lawsuit against Earl Scheib Inc., doing business as Earl Scheib Paint & Body, and 6 Does, alleging discrimination and retaliation on the basis of race, black, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the complaint alleged racial harassment and race based discrimination by subjecting them to harassment and a hostile work environment, and retaliated against them following their complaint about such treatment.  Following some discovery, the parties settled the lawsuit in September 2004 through a consent decree.

The three year decree required the defendant to: make reports on complaints and other compliance reports, keep records, allow access to outsiders for monitoring, hire an outside EEOC consultant, agree not to harass, discriminate or retaliate against their employees, post notice of employee rights, provide annual training to all employees, and pay $375,000 to be distributed among five complaining parties and a fund for unidentified claimants.

The decree was entered in 2004 and scheduled to last 2007. No further docket entries exist, so the case is presumably closed.

EE-CA-0039,"In September 2002, the EEOC district office in Los Angeles, California brought this suit against Bazaar Del Mundo, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of California.  The complaint states that a Black female alleged that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it refused to hire her, and similarly situated Blacks, for service positions.  After two settlement conferences, a consent decree was entered in August 2003. 

In the consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would pay the class of complainants $120,000, refrain from discriminating on the basis of race, hire an EEO consultant to ensure compliance, post and distribute an EEO notice, provide four hours of EEO training, make a good faith effort to hire five percent Blacks out of its total hiring each year, and submit annual audit reports.  No fees or costs were awarded.  The terms of the agreement ran for three years.

Bazaar Del Mundo denies that it violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and asserts that it hires all employees on the basis of job qualifications only and does not discriminate against any protected group.\nBazaar Del Mundo and the Commission engaged in settlement negotiations to resolve their differences and have agreed that they share a common interest in Bazaar Del Mundo having a workplace free from any kind of unlawful discrimination. To resolve this lawsuit the parties have entered into a Consent Decree which states that Bazaar Del Mundo will not permit race discrimination in recruiting and hiring and it will engage in recruiting activities in African-American communities with the goal of increasing diversity in the workplace. It also states that Bazaar Del Mundo will provide periodic reports to the EEOC regarding its hiring practices and it will provide training to its supervisory employees regarding laws and regulations prohibiting discrimination. Bazaar Del Mundo has agreed to pay a monetary sum and to post this Notice in a place frequented by employees for a period of three years.\nIt is Bazaar Del Mundo\'s policy to extend equal employment opportunities to all persons in all aspects of the employer-employee relationship, including recruitment, hiring, upgrading, training, promotion, transfer, discipline, layoff, recall and termination. Any employee who violates Bazaar Del Mundo\'s policy prohibiting discrimination will receive appropriate disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment. The black claimants applied for various jobs with defendant, including cashier, salesperson, line cook/food prep, and customer service positions, and though qualified for the positions for which they applied, were not hired. Instead, defendant continued soliciting applications and hired less qualified non-black applicants. Pursuant to the decree, defendant is enjoined from engaging in any hiring practice which discriminates against blacks. Neither the agreement to enter into this consent decree nor any provisions herein constitute any admission by either party as to the claims or defenses of the other. The Consent decree in no way effects the EEOC's rights to process charges against BDM not otherwise covered by the decree.",0.761,0.0732,0.1336,0.2722,0.026,0.0475,0.3774,0.0363,0.0662

Specifically, the defendant allegedly had a pattern or practice of creating a hostile work environment.  The complainants intervened in the lawsuit in June 2001.  Following discovery and several status conferences, the parties settled the lawsuit in 2002 through a consent decree.

The one-year decree, containing non-discrimination and retaliation provisions, required the defendant to: report on complaints and make other compliance reports, keep records, allow access to outsiders for monitoring, develop its anti-discrimination policy, post and distribute notice, provide EEO training, and pay $70,000 to be distributed among five individuals.

EE-LA-0028,"In August 1998, the EEOC district office in New Orleans, Louisiana brought this suit against the General Motors Corporation (GM), an international automobile manufacturer, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Louisiana.  The intervenor's complaint alleged that GM unlawfully discriminated against a female employee in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, she alleged that, while at the Shreveport facility, coworkers sexually harassed her to the point she had to quit her position.  After a defense motion for dismissal and partial summary judgment was pending for approximately three months, the parties jointly moved for a consent decree to be entered in December 1999.  

The consent decree dictated the fallowing: defendant must (1) pay the aggrieved employee $100,000 in settlement of all claims relating to this litigation, (2) provide the EEOC with semi-annual complaint reports, and (3) provide EEO training to all of its supervisors and managers.

EE-AZ-0067,"In September 2003, the Phoenix District Office and Denver Office of the EEOC filed this lawsuit against Lennar Homes of Arizona, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona alleging violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act.  Complainants allege that their positions as Sales Consultants were terminated, by the defendant, despite their records of high performance. Additionally, complainants allege that the defendant hired younger and less experienced representatives to take their place.

Following extensive discovery and a series of failed motions for partial summary judgment by the defendant, the parties settlted the lawsuit in July 2006 through a consent decree.

The one-year decree, containing an anti-retaliaton clause, required the defendant to: make biannual compliance reports, keep records of compliance, provide complainants with references, post notice of employee rights, provide a training seminar regarding the ADEA to Phoenix employees, and pay $425,000 to be distributed among five individuals.

The decree was entered in July 2006 and scheduled to last until July 2007. No further docket entries exist, so the case is closed.

EE-FL-0061,"In June 2005, the EEOC district office in Miami, Florida brought this suit against Hospital Housekeeping Systems, Ltd. in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.  The complaint states that a Hispanic female employee alleged national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, she alleged that she was unlawfully terminated when the defendant instituted a discriminatory English-only policy.  After only a single EEOC motion to compel, the parties settled and a consent decree was entered in June 2006.  

In the consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would pay the aggrieved party $10,000, refrain from retaliating and discriminating on the basis of national origin, implement an English-only policy only when absolutely necessary for the performance of a specific job, post EEO notices, distribute copies of its anti-discrimination policy, provide two hours of EEO training annually, retain all records of complaints, and make semiannual reports to the EEOC.

The terms of the agreement were to run for 3 years. The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement took place; the case was presumably closed in 2009.

FA-LA-0001,"On April 14, 2004, individuals and an advocacy organization filed this First Amendment case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New Orleans against Jefferson Parish claiming the Parish had unfairly applied parish ordinances (including one known as ""the circus ordinance"") to squelch pro-life speech. the plaintiffs were represented by the Alliance Defense Fund, ""an alliance of more than 700 attorneys defending religious liberty through strategy, training, funding, and litigation."" (ADF Press Release)

The plaintiffs claimed they were unlawfully prohibited from using voice amplification equipment, a stage, and from playing religious songs in their 2004 protest against the Roe v. Wade decision. 

Before a hearing could be held on the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, the parish council used an emergency procedure to approve changes to the ordinances and the case was dismissed.","['••\n\nCase 2:04-cv-01057-SSV Document 1 Filed 04/14/2004 Page 1 of 48\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF LOUISIANA\n\nREVEREND WILLIAM SHANKS, KATHLEEN BENFIELD, REVEREND GRANT STORMS, and UNITED FOR LIFE, INC.,\n\n04~l057\n\nPlaintiffs, v.\n\nCIVNO. 4\n\nPARISH OF JEFFERSON, LOUISIANA, JEFFERSON PARISH SHERIFF\'S OFFICE, WILLIAM A.

The said Ordinances and restrictions are inherently unconstitutional because they place a\n\nprior restraint on free speech, are unconstitutionally vague and overbroad, do not require a\n\nprompt decision on permit applications nor an appeal process, and allow for unfettered\n\ndiscretion on the part of parish decision makers and the prohibition of a wide variety of\n\nprotected speech based upon its content and viewpoint.\n\nAdditional Restrictions on Speech: ""Noise""\n\n46. The words shall also mean and include the making of any announcement to the public, whether oral or written, concerning an appeal, assemblage, athletic or sports event, bazaar benefit, campaign, contest, dance, drive, entertainment, exhibition, exposition, party, performance, picnic, sale or social gathering, to which the public is invited or requested to make a contribution.\nStreets shall mean all public streets, roads, thoroughfares, highways, bridges, alleys, passageways, rights-of-way, medians, curbs and shoulders of the road.

Other groups and individuals demonstrate against abortion, counsel, or pray at Causeway.\nThese other groups and individuals are not associated with Plaintiffs although they share the common belief that abortion is morally, politically, and/or spiritually wrong. Plaintiffs sometimes approach persons as they walk to the clinic and offer literature describing the abortion procedure and the alternatives available to pregnant women. These contract officers often arrive at the clinic in their patrol cars. The riot officers were dispatched as a means of intimidating Plaintiffs and other Memorial Service participants. Because of Defendants\' actions, Plaintiffs have been very reluctant to, and have refrained from, speaking on the public ways ofJefferson Parish because they fear arrest or citation. Defendants were Informed oftheir Unlawful Conduct 96. The January 21, 2004, letter placed Defendants on notice of the unconstitutionality of their actions, including the failure to act in timely fashion upon Rev. Shanks\' Special Event application, the failure to recognize that peaceable expressive activity on public\nPage 15\n\n\x0cCase 2:04-cv-01057-SSV Document 1 Filed 04/14/2004 Page 17 of 48\n\nproperty does not require a prior permit, and the fact that a permit should not be required\n\nfor a small soapbox stage or volume-controlled amplification equipment.\n\n98. On January 22, 2004, Plaintiffs\' counsel faxed a SIX-page response letter to Mr.\n\nWilkinson explaining in detail why Defendants\' interpretation and intended application of\n\nthe Ordinances was and would be unconstitutional.\n\n101. The sound was amplified by a battery-operated speaker. Due to Defendants\' threats, other event participants were forced to carry the keyboard as it was played.\n112. In an effort to accommodate the Defendants\' orders, Plaintiffs moved their sound equipment and keyboard from the public right-of-way to a less desirable location, and placed them on a flatbed trailer that was legally parked on the nearby street.\n114. As they began their speech activities again, Defendant Samrow made new threats of arrest, and said, ""You can\'t have live music without a permit!""\n115. It is the policy, custom, or practice of Defendants to threaten Plaintiffs and other pro-life advocates with citation and arrest for expressive activities occurring within the public rights-of-way near Causeway, as described herein.\n121. Speech is entitled to comprehensive protection under the First Amendment. Plaintiffs\' expressive activities on the dates alleged herein at or near the Defendant Clinic were constitutionally protected. The above cited sections of Chapter 6, Article IV of the Ordinances are unconstitutional on as applied on grounds that they are substantially vague, overbroad, impermissibly restrict free speech and association, act as prior restraints, lack procedural safeguards, violate equal protection, and grant parish officials with unfettered discretion in the restriction of expreSSIOn.\n144. The Ordinances and conduct of the Defendants constitute a violation of the Article I, Sections 7, 8 and 9 of the Louisiana Constitution, by among other things, requiring a thirty day advance approval and permit before allowing assemblies and expressive activities on public property.\n152. Defendants\' Ordinances are vague and overbroad. WHEREFORE Plaintiffs respectfully pray that the Court grant the relief set forth hereinafter in the prayer for relief.\nVIII. Plaintiff realleges all matters set forth in the preceding paragraphs and incorporates them herein. Defendants\' Ordinances on their face and as applied impose a system of prior restraints on the publication and/or circulation of Plaintiffs printed and oral expression.

EE-AL-0086,"The Birmingham office of the EEOC brought this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama against Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. in April 2005.  The complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated against employees in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.  More specifically, the complaint alleged the defendant terminated the employment of four employees based on their ages.  The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment which was denied in January 2005.  This case consolidated with a suit brought on behalf of the complainants by a private attorney (2:05-cv-00714-WMA).   The parties attended mediation in March 2007 and the case was subsequently dismissed.  The terms of the settlement are unknown.

","The Commission alleges that, in December 2002, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., terminated L. B. Garrison, age 57, Beverly McCluskey, age 49, Robbie Scogin, age 57, and Sharon Tittle, age 51, from their employment in Defendant’s receiving department because of their age.\nJURISDICTION AND VENUE 1. Prior to institution of this lawsuit, the Commission\'s representatives attempted to eliminate the unlawful employment practices alleged below and to effect voluntary compliance with the ADEA through informal methods of conciliation, conference and persuasion within the meaning of Section 7(b) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 626(b).\n2\n\n\x0cCase 2:05-cv-00733-WMA Document 1 Filed 04/07/2005 Page 3 of 5\nSTATEMENT OF CLAIMS 7. The unlawful employment practices complained of in paragraph 7 above were willful within the meaning of Section 7(b) of the ADEA, 29 U.S.C. § 626(b).\nPRAYER FOR RELIEF Wherefore, the Commission respectfully requests that this Court: A. Grant a permanent injunction enjoining Defendant Employer, its officers, successors, assigns and all persons in active concert or participation with it, from engaging in the conduct alleged in paragraph 7 above and any other employment practice which discriminates on the basis of age against individuals 40 years of age and older. Store 409 closed during nighttime hours before May 2002, but starting on or about May 18, 2002, it stayed open for business 24 hours per day. When Store 409 went 24 hours, Tittle, Scobin, and McClusky, and Stacy Warren (“Warren”) worked on Garrison’s night stocking crew. Counce was initially responsible for the entire night crew at Store 409, and he became the Night Assistant Manager when Store 409 went 24 hours in 2002. Wal-Mart has written corporate policies which govern employee\n2\n\n\x0cCase 2:05-cv-00733-WMA Document 42 Filed 01/05/2007 Page 3 of 12\n\nbreaks and meal periods. Employees receive full compensation for these breaks (or “rest periods”) and are not required to clock out while taking them. If Counce was not on duty on a particular night, Garrison scheduled the meal period. On some\n3\n\n\x0cCase 2:05-cv-00733-WMA Document 42 Filed 01/05/2007 Page 4 of 12\nnights, members of the night stocking crew would take a meal period without clocking out, and on other nights they would substitute a 15-minute break for the meal period or would simply not take a meal period at all. Moreover, Counce told the night stocking crew that on nights in which they did not intend to work at least 6 hours, they should not take a meal period; Counce and Durham gave Garrison the authority to determine whether he thought the crew would be finished with their work in less than 6 hours and would thus not need to take a meal period. Additionally, there were occasions when Durham specifically told members of the night stocking crew not to clock out for a meal period, or gave them the option to forgo their meal period in order to get their work done faster.\nOn December 7, 2002, Durham went to Store 409 to review the Timeclock Archive Report, which appears to be a printout summary of the hours worked by each employee at Store 409. Jeffreys interviewed each member of the night stocking crew on December 19, 2002. At least once per week on average, Counce told Garrison that if he had his way he would fire the whole night stocking crew and get a crew of younger people. Warren also heard Counce say that he would like to replace the crew with younger people because they could work faster. Additionally, Counce nicknamed Garrison “Uncle,” because Garrison was “the oldest.” Garrison reported Counce’s comments to Durham, but there appears to be no evidence to suggest that Durham took any action in response.\nIn addition to Counce’s age-related statements, Durham told Garrison when Garrison applied for a different job within Store 409 that “I’m your friend, you will be better off where you are at. And besides, you don’t have a lot of good years left. You would be better off where you are at for the years that you have left.” When Garrison was passed up for a promotion, Durham told him that the reason was that the person who got the promotion had more experience on the floor in dealing with customers. This determination involves applying substantive law to the relevant facts that have been developed. See id. at 248; Barfield v. Brierton, 883 F.2d 923, 933 (11th Cir. Early v. Champion Int’l Corp, 907 F.2d 1077, 1081 (11th Cir. Plaintiffs counter that although Jeffreys and Durham issued the firings, Counce influenced their decision to terminate plaintiffs such that he was, in effect, also a decisionmaker. See, e.g., Lewis v. Y.M.C.A., 53 F.Supp.2d 1253, 1260 (N.D. Ala. 1999). In addition to his age-related comments, Counce conducted the investigation that led to the discharge of the members of the night stocking crew, and he provided Durham with a signed statement in which he concluded that plaintiffs had engaged in gross misconduct and had stolen company time. B. Circumstantial Evidence\nPlaintiffs can also establish a prima face case of age discrimination under the familiar McDonnell Douglas framework. Reeves v. Sanderson Plumbing Products, Inc., 530 U.S. 133, 152 (2000). The court is not entirely convinced that any of this other evidence could demonstrate pretext. However, the court does believe that the three pieces of evidence listed above, if proven, could serve as circumstantial or direct evidence that Wal-Mart’s stated reason for firing plaintiffs was not its actual reason. Although Wal-Mart’s jury case is strengthened by the fact that it fired all members of the night stocking crew, including a person under 40, this fact alone would not preclude a reasonable jury from finding Wal-Mart’s stated reason for firing plaintiffs to be pretextual.

EE-CA-0214,"The San Francisco District Office filed this case in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.  The defendant was Sun Pacific Shippers, Inc., and several related business entities.  It was alleged that the complainant, a female, was sexually harassed in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The lawsuit was filed in July 2004 and was eventually resolved by consent decree in June 2005.  The complainant, who did not intervene in the case, was awarded a total of $45,000.  In addition, the company had to provide a training session, revise and distribute its employee handbook and complaint procedures, and make semi-annual reports to the EEOC.  The duration of the consent decree was eighteen months.
