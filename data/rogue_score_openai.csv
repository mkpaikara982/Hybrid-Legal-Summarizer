EE-MO-0105,"On January 23, 2004, Plaintiff filed an amended complaint under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, 42 U.S.C. § 2000e et seq. and 2000e(k), against AT&T Corporation in the United States District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, was a former AT&T employee and asked the Court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, alleging that AT&T's health insurance policy discriminated against women.  Specifically, the plaintiff contended that the defendant's health insurance plan, which did not provide prescription contraceptives (birth control) before 2002 and only through the mail after 2002, violated female employees' civil rights.

The action originally started in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, but was transferred to Missouri on May 12, 2003.  This is the date on which the docket begins.  Originally, there were two plaintiffs on the case, but one dropped out of the litigation.  Thus, a single plaintiff carried forth the case.

On September 3, 2004, the Court (Judge Sachs) denied the plaintiff's motion for class certification.  In the opinion, the Court barely discussed the requirements for a class-action lawsuit, except to point out typicality.  The plaintiff, since the suit began, had stopped taking birth control and was seeking to get pregnant.  Therefore, the Court declared that a class could not be certified without a class representative who would have an ongoing interest in the prayed-for relief.  The plaintiff wanted to recover her past expenditures on the prescribed contraceptives.  The Women's Law project came onto the case as an amicus.  After a lengthy discovery period, the Court made another ruling.

On June 7, 2006, the Court (Judge Sachs) granted the plaintiff's motion for class certification as to the damages in the complaint.  The class was comprised of female employees of AT&T, who paid for their own prescription contraception from the dates of October 31, 2001 to July 2, 2002.  The Court did not certify the claims for injunctive or declaratory relief because as of 2002, the health insurance provider covered birth control through mail order. While the cost of the plaintiff's potential recovery was relatively small, $68.07, the class action potential in the litigation, given AT&T's size made both parties fight vigorously.  According to the docket, neither side was content with this decision.  The plaintiff wanted the period of time for damages claims to be extended, and the defendant did not approve of the decision at all.  Ultimately, the plaintiffs filed an appeal.  

On June 1, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit issued a preliminary judgment to the District Court (Judge Sachs).  The Circuit Court advised the District Court to review the findings of another recent case, In Re Union Pacific Railroad Employment Practices Litigation, 479 F.3d 936 (8th Cir. 2007).  This case featured a ruling that was fundamentally at odds with the decision of the District Court on June 7, 2006.

On October 22, 2007, the District Court (Judge Sachs) vacated its previous decision, and ordered a decision in favor of the defendant.  The case was closed the next day on October 23, 2007.

This case, Lund and Stocking v. AT&T Corporation, involves a class action lawsuit filed by plaintiffs Jane Lund and Susan Stocking against defendant AT&T Corporation. Stocking, who has been employed by AT&T since 1995, requested health insurance coverage for prescription contraceptives, but her request was denied. This led to her filing a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and obtaining the right to sue. The complaint alleges that AT&T's exclusion of prescription contraceptives from their health plan is discriminatory and violates Title VII and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA). The proposed class includes all female employees of AT&T who have used prescription contraceptives since August of a certain year. The plaintiffs seek relief in the form of damages, equitable relief, and a permanent injunction against the discriminatory policy.

The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the law firms of Gunderson Sharp & Walke, LLP, Holtsclaw & Kendall, LC, and Sylvester James, Jr. The defendant is represented by attorneys from the law firms of Lathrop & Gage, L.C., Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, LLP, and Akin, Gump, Strauss, Hauer & Feld, LLP",0.5806,0.1985,0.2959,0.1838,0.0626,0.0934,0.2742,0.0938,0.1397
EE-MI-0138,"In September 2003, the Detroit office of the EEOC brought this Title VII suit against Robert Bosch Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated against the claimant by failing to provide the claimant with a reasonable accommodation and terminating him because of his religion (Seventh-day Adventist). The claimant intervened in the EEOC's suit in December 2003. The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment in December 2003, and the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant in October 2004. The EEOC appealed the case in December 2004, and the Sixth Circuit vacated the judgment and remanded the case in February 2006. The case went to trial in September 2006, and the jury entered a verdict in favor of the defendant in September 2006.

The document in question, E.E.O.C. v. Robert Bosch Corp., is a collection of court filings and orders from a case filed in 2003 by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on behalf of employee Jeff Carter against his employer, the Robert Bosch Corporation. Carter, a devout Seventh-day Adventist, was terminated from his position at the company's manufacturing plant due to conflicts between his religious beliefs and work requirements. The EEOC alleged that Bosch had violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by discriminating against Carter based on his religion. The defendant argued that they had made reasonable efforts to accommodate Carter, including offering to find volunteers to cover his shifts on Saturdays. However, no one volunteered and the union steward was unable to find a replacement for Carter's shifts. The EEOC argued that Bosch should have initiated formal negotiations with the union to pursue other accommodation options. The case was initially assigned to Magistrate Judge Timothy P. Greeley before being reassigned to Senior Judge Richard Alan Enslen. Throughout the proceedings, there were several motions filed by both parties, including a motion for intervention by Carter and a motion for summary judgment by Bosch. The court also held a mediation session, but it ultimately did not result in a settlement. The",0.3041,0.4714,0.3697,0.088,0.1367,0.107,0.1613,0.25,0.1961
EE-FL-0124,"On May 10, 2002, the United States filed a lawsuit under Title VII against the City of Fort Lauderdale in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, alleging that City's Public Services Department discriminated against an employee on the basis of his race. Specifically, the United States contended that the defendant failed or refused to promote an employee to the position of Engineering Inspector because he was an African-American, and that the defendant failed or refused to take appropriate action to remedy fully the effects of the discrimination against this employee. Furthermore, the United States alleged that the City of Fort Lauderdale subjected the employee to harassment that adversely affected the terms, conditions, and privileges of his employment because he opposed the discriminatory employment practices, filed an internal complaint of discrimination with the City, and filed a charge of discrimination with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. The United States sought injunctive and monetary relief.

The defendant eventually promoted the employee to the position of Engineering Inspector I in September 1998, but did not receive back pay or other relief. The defendant denied the United States' allegations and further denied that it had engaged in any unlawful employment discrimination, harassment, or retaliation in violation of Title VII. 

On January 13, 2003, the plaintiffs and the defendant agreed to enter into a consent decree ordered by the district court (Judge Donald L. Graham). The City of Fort Lauderdale agreed not to engage in any act that unlawfully discriminates against any employee or potential employee because of that individual's race. The City further agreed that it would not retaliate against any person in a manner prohibited by Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 because that person made an internal complaint of discrimination; filed a charge of discrimination with the EEOC, the Florida Commission on Human Relations, or the Broward County Human Rights Division; participated in or cooperated with the initiation, investigation, litigation or administration of this settlement agreement; or provided information to the Department of Justice. Furthermore, the city of Fort Lauderdale agreed to post anti-discrimination and anti-harassment policies in a prominent and conspicuous location in City Hall and in the Department of Public Services. 

Additionally, the City agreed to arrange mandatory training for all employees. While this settlement agreement remains in effect, the city will maintain all records related to the filling of vacancies for Engineering Inspector I positions for each hiring event, application period, test administration, and phase of any test administration, and the Department of Justice can request to see them in order to monitor the city's compliance.

The docket ends on December 7, 2005 with the district court (Judge Graham) entering and order dismissing the case with prejudice.

This collection of documents pertains to a legal case filed by the United States Department of Justice against the City of Fort Lauderdale, Florida for alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The case was brought after receiving a charge of discrimination from Elgin O. Jones, who worked for the City and was not promoted due to his race. The United States sought relief for Mr. Jones, including a jury trial, and asserted jurisdiction under various federal laws. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) also investigated the case and found reasonable cause to believe the allegations were true. After attempts to resolve the charge voluntarily, the EEOC referred the case to the Department of Justice. The lawsuit claims that the City discriminated against Mr. Jones based on his race and in retaliation for opposing discriminatory practices. The City is accused of being a person and employer within the meaning of Title VII. The United States sought an injunction to prevent the City from continuing with discriminatory practices and damages for Mr. Jones. 

The documents also reveal that the Defendant, the City of Fort Lauderdale, agreed to settle the case and implement measures to ensure equal employment opportunities for all candidates in the future. The settlement agreement included provisions for mandatory training for all employees on antidiscrimination and",0.6532,0.3139,0.424,0.2941,0.141,0.1906,0.3198,0.1537,0.2076
DR-TX-0003,"On April 25, 2016, three individuals that were blind and enrolled in the Barbri bar exam preparation course filed this putative class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The plaintiffs brought this suit against BarBri Inc., aka Barbri Bar Review, a company that sells and provides products for bar exam preparation. The plaintiffs alleged that Barbri violated the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 et seq.) and the Texas Human Resource Code §§ 121.002-.003. The plaintiffs, represented by Texas Civil Rights Project and Washington Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights/Urban Affairs, sought injunctive, monetary, and declaratory relief as well as attorneys’ fees and costs. This case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Renee Harris Toliver.

The three plaintiffs were all enrolled in the Barbri bar preparation course and relied on Barbri to prepare for the bar examination. The Barbri bar preparation course provided online bar review resources including online live chat to match Barbri students with tutors, an online planner, study outlines, online lecture notes, and online lecture videos. The website, however, was not compatible with the software that the plaintiffs relied on to access the internet, like Job Access With Speech (“JAWS”) screen readers. The plaintiffs requested reasonable accommodation, but BarBri did not provide them. 

On July 1, 2016, the defendant moved to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The plaintiff amended their complaint on July 19, 2016. This new complaint added more factual allegations and slightly modified the definition of the sought class. The amended class definition was as follows: “All legally blind individuals nationwide who, on or after April 25, 2014, took, plan to take or attempted to take a Barbri bar review course at a time when Barbri’s website, mobile application, or other course materials was or is not fully accessible to legally blind students, or who have   been discouraged from taking the Barbri bar review course due to such inaccessibility.” 

The defendant again moved to dismiss the lawsuit for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on October 3, 2016. The plaintiffs moved to certify a class on February 10, 2017. The court never ruled on this motion.

In October 2017, the parties underwent settlement discussions. Eventually the parties reached a confidential Settlement Agreement. Then on January 19, 2018, the parties jointly moved for a stipulation of dismissal and sought approval of a consent decree.

Three days later, the court approved the parties’ consent decree. The parties agreed that the court would retain jurisdiction for three years to ensure compliance with this decree. The consent decree prohibited the defendant from engaging in disability discrimination, required the defendant to comply with the ADA, and required the defendant to undergo an accessibility audit to ensure that all accessibility barriers for screen readers were removed. The defendant also agreed to provide accessibility training to all development team employees and to reform its procedures for implementing reasonable accommodations when students request accommodations.

The consent decree remains in force as of May 2020.

The case was quickly disposed of, with a consent decree being entered in June 2001.  

In the consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would pay the aggrieved women $75,000 each, refrain from retaliating or discriminating in the basis of sex, post EEO notices, provide EEO training, make semiannual reports to the EEOC, have the alleged harassers read the consent decree, issue neutral reference letters, implement an anti-discrimination policy, and appoint a compliance official.

The plaintiffs, represented by public interest counsel, sought preliminary and permanent injunctive relief. They requested that the Court enjoin the Juvenile Court from arresting and detaining youth without conducting a probable cause hearing. The plaintiffs claimed that the detention of youth after 48 hours without providing a probable cause hearing violates their right to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment.

The first plaintiff was arrested at school on September 12, 2014, on a charge of aggravated robbery. Based on the victim's description, a warrant was issued, and the plaintiff was taken into custody at the Hamilton County Detention Center. He was in isolation for two days. The Juvenile Court did not make a probable cause determination prior to issuing a warrant for the first plaintiff, nor within 48 hours of detention. The case was continued on October 6, 2014, for a probable cause hearing, which never happened. S.W. had a trial on October 10, 2014, where the case was dismissed on the merits. Although S.W. was released, he never received a probable cause hearing at arrest or during his detention. 

The second plaintiff was arrested outside his home on July 8, 2014, by Cincinnati police officers, who did not present an arrest warrant. He was taken to the local police station, interrogated for alleged involvement in a robbery, and taken to the Hamilton County Detention Center on July 9, 2014. He remained incarcerated at the Detention Center from July 8 to July 23, during which time no probable cause determinations in his case occurred. 

On December 10, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. Although a preliminary injunction hearing was scheduled for March 24, 2015, the parties began settlement negotiations in February 2015 and the hearing was changed to a status conference on settlement progress.

On September 29, 2015, the parties reached an agreement and Judge Susan Dlott approved and adopted an agreed order of dismissal without prejudice. The Hamilton County Juvenile Court agreed to plan, design, and implement a best practice model for processing complaints, issuing arrest warrants, making probable cause determinations, and conducting detention hearings. This included revisions to Rule 38 of the Rules of Practice for Hamilton County Juvenile Court. Additionally, the juvenile court agreed create a new training curriculum to assist clerks in making probable cause determinations. The Hamilton County Prosecuting Attorney also agreed to assign an assistant prosecuting attorney to attend detention hearings at the Youth Center.

It revolves around a civil rights lawsuit filed by the plaintiffs, Pamela Matthews and Nefertteria Dawson, on behalf of themselves and other juveniles in similar situations, against the Hamilton County Juvenile Court and Detention Center in Ohio. The defendants, John M. Williams, Dwayne R. Bowman, and the Hamilton County Board of Commissioners, are responsible for creating and enforcing policies for the juvenile court and detention center.

AAI alleged that OMB violated FOIA by failing to disclose requested records pertaining to OMB’s decision not to include a combined race and ethnicity question or a Middle Eastern or North African (MENA) category on the 2020 Census. AAI asked the court to declare that OMB violated FOIA and to issue an injunction ordering the agency to release the requested records. This case was assigned to Judge Amy Berman Jackson. 

One month later, on May 18, 2018, the court ordered OMB to file a dispositive motion or a status report setting a schedule for OMB’s production of documents to AAI. OMB chose the latter, filing its first status report on June 15, 2018. Over the next two years, the parties filed several joint status reports detailing which documents OMB had disclosed to AAI and which documents were still outstanding or disputed. By May 13, 2020, OMB had reviewed approximately 2,000 potentially responsive documents, producing “a number” of them to AAI and withholding 161 of them, claiming they were FOIA exempt. AAI objected to the withholding of five of the allegedly exempt documents.

OMB filed a motion for summary judgment on February 10, 2020, arguing that the five disputed documents were exempt under FOIA Exemption 5, which allows agencies to withhold “inter-agency or intra-agency memorandums or letters that would not be available by law to a party other than an agency in litigation with the agency,” including “predecisional and deliberative” documents that reflect internal Executive Branch deliberations. AAI filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on March 12, 2020, arguing that OMB had not provided a sufficient basis for exempting the documents and that the exemption didn’t apply because the documents were not “predecisional.” On August 13, 2020, after conducting in camera review, the court granted OMB’s motion for summary judgment and denied AAI’s cross-motion, finding that the disputed documents were predecisional and exempt from FOIA. 2020 WL 4698098.

This document is a civil complaint filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Schefenacker Vision Systems USA, Incorporated, a Michigan-based corporation. The complaint alleges that the defendant unlawfully terminated the employment of Janet Nedrow, a former employee, on the basis of her age, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC, as the agency responsible for enforcing the ADEA, brings this action to correct the discriminatory practices and seeks to make Nedrow whole.

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated their First Amendment rights to free speech and expression through their policies and practices. They argued that the defendants' ordinances and actions were vague, overbroad, and discriminatory, and required individuals to obtain prior permission before assembling or speaking at public gatherings. Failure to do so could result in criminal and civil sanctions, which the plaintiffs claimed infringed upon their rights. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the Alliance Defense Fund Law Center, sought relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and requested an injunction to prevent further violations.

PC-NJ-0024,"On November 5, 2015, the plaintiffs, nine pretrial detainees, filed this class action in the United States District Court of New Jersey. The plaintiffs sued Middlesex County under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 for the deprivation of rights secured by the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and the New Jersey Office of the Public Defender, asked the court to declare that the conditions in solitary confinement were unconstitutional, to enjoin Middlesex County to take all of its inmates out of solitary confinement, and to award costs and reasonable attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the conditions in C-Pod, the solitary confinement unit in Middlesex County Jail, were unconstitutional. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that they were locked in a small cell alone almost continuously; could not interact with other inmates; could not be visited by family; could not participate in religious, educational or rehabilitative programs; and were never allowed outdoors. 

The plaintiffs sought class action status. However, on January 4, 2016, Judge Peter G. Sheridan granted the plaintiffs' request to withdraw their pending motion for class certification without prejudice so that the ACLU attorneys could get acclimated to the case before proceeding with a dispositive motion. 

The parties then began settlement conversations. On May 24, 2017, the Court stayed discovery in order to further facilitate the parties’ settlement discussions. The parties reached a settlement with eight of the nine plaintiffs signing the agreement by June 19, 2018.

The eight remaining plaintiffs entered a private settlement agreement with the defendants on September 25, 2018. Under the settlement agreement, the county would continue to operate a precautionary supervision unit, but also provide 28 hours per week out of cells, access to recreation time, in-unit programming, and law library services. Protections used would involve less restrictive security measures. Disciplinary detention could no longer exceed 15 days for a single disciplinary charge and 30 days for multiple disciplinary charges. The county also implemented a mental health screening policy that allowed the director of mental health to stop inappropriate placements in solitary confinement. The settlement agreement permitted the plaintiffs’ counsel access to people detained in the jail, jail records, and the facility itself to ensure full compliance with the settlement. The defendants agreed to pay $11,123 in attorneys’ fees and cost. Under the agreement, any alleged non-compliance would first be brought to the defendant’s counsel, with the opportunity for mediation. The settlement agreement was enforceable for two years. If the mediation failed to resolve the issue, plaintiffs were permitted to move the Court for reinstatement or ask for a one-time one-year extension of the agreement. The two-year enforcement period began on the date the parties executed the agreement.

Judge Peter G. Sheridan entered a stipulated of dismissal on October 25, 2018. As of March 21, 2019, the settlement is still in force.","

PA-CA-0002,"On September 9, 2014, the National Federation of the Blind (NFB), along with several of its members who had been discriminated against by Uber drivers because of their service animals, filed this lawsuit in the U.S District Court for the Northern District of California. They sued Uber under Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 12811 et seq.), the California Unruh Civil Rights Act (California Civil Code §§ 51 & 52), and the California Disabled Persons Act (California Civil Code §§ 54-54.3). Represented by Disability Rights Advocates and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief as well as damages for the named plaintiffs.

The plaintiffs accused Uber drivers of, among other things, refusing to provide service to people with service dogs, mistreating the dogs and their owners, unfairly giving them negative feedback scores, and charging inappropriate cancellation fees. They alleged that Uber’s response to complaints about driver behavior was opaque and insufficient: Uber generally failed to notify service dog owners of whether the company had investigated complaints, and denied responsibility for drivers’ behavior.

On October 22, 2014, Uber filed a motion to dismiss, claiming that the NFB and the named plaintiffs all lacked standing to sue under both state and federal law. Uber also argued that even if the plaintiffs had standing, Uber wasn’t a public accommodation and thus wasn’t covered by Title III of the ADA. 

The United States Department of Justice issued a statement of interest on December 23, 2014. It asked the court to consider the Department of Transportation’s Title III regulations, which are granted considerable weight since the DOT is responsible for implementing the ADA. DOT regulations state that Title III applies to any “demand-responsive” service that doesn’t operate on a fixed route, and that private entities cannot “contract away” any responsibilities under the ADA. 49 C.F.R. § 37.3; 49 C.F.R. pt. 37, app. D § 37.23. The DOT regulations further require entities covered by Title III to permit service animals to accompany their owners into vehicles, and requires entities to apply eligibility criteria that don’t screen disabled people out, unless doing so would make it impossible to provide the service. 49 C.F.R. § 37.167(d); 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(1); 49 C.F.R. § 37.5(f). The regulations also require positive action on the part of private entities to make reasonable modifications in policies, practices, or procedures when necessary to avoid discrimination (except when those modifications would fundamentally alter the service), and to ensure that their personnel are trained to properly assist disabled individuals in a respectful and courteous way, with appropriate attention to the difference among individuals with disabilities. 42 U.S.C. § 12184(b)(2)(A); 49 C.F.R. § 37.173. 

On April 17, 2015, the court denied Uber’s motion to dismiss. It found that even if not all Uber drivers discriminated against blind people with service animals, discrimination by some drivers was sufficient injury for the plaintiffs to bring suit. The court also found that the NFB could sue even if some of its members had signed binding arbitration agreements with Uber, because many of its members had not. The court didn’t directly respond to the DOJ’s statement of interest, finding instead that since there was a possibility that Uber was covered by the ADA and the California statutes, the parties should have the opportunity to litigate the question. 103 F. Supp. 3d 1073.

On December 6, 2016, the court approved a settlement agreement. Uber agreed to: <ul><li>Require its drivers to provide service to blind people with service animals<li>Modify its cleaning fee policy for messes caused by service animals<li>Make it easier for service animal owners to file complaints<li>Implement enhanced procedures for investigating complaints<li>Dismiss drivers receiving multiple plausible complaints<li>Submit to third-party monitoring<li>Pay the NFB $75,000 per year for three years<li>Pay a lump sum of $45,000 for distribution among the named plaintiffs<li>Pay the plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees and costs</ul>Uber also agreed to a class certification for purposes of the settlement, extending to all blind people with service animals who had used, attempted to use, or been deterred from attempting to use transportation through the Uber app.

The settlement was to last for a default period of 3½ years. Retired Judge Margaret A. Nagle was appointed as a neutral monitor to oversee compliance. The monitor had authority to extend the agreement by 1½ years if Uber failed to substantially comply with the terms of the agreement in the second or third year. Any disputes related to the monitor would first be referred to an arbitrator, and if that failed, the court would exercise jurisdiction.

Two weeks following the approval of the settlement agreement, on December 15, 2016, the court awarded the plaintiffs $2,485,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs. Uber appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit, which dismissed the appeal with prejudice on March 7, 2017. 

On November 8, 2019, the court ordered Uber to pay the plaintiffs a total of $313,000 in attorneys’ fees and costs incurred in monitoring and enforcing the agreement. 

On July 15, 2020, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion to modify the settlement. As of July 20, 2020, the court’s jurisdiction over the settlement agreement is ongoing.","

Those facilities included the McPherson Training School in Ocala, the Arthur G. Dozier School for Boys in Marianna and the Florida School for Boys at Okeechobee, subsequently renamed the Eckerd Youth Development Center. 

Plaintiffs were represented by attorneys for the ACLU National Prison Project, the Youth Law Center and the Southern Legal Counsel. Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief.  

Following several years of litigation and improvements to the Florida juvenile justice system, the parties entered into a Consent Decree to resolve all claims.  The Consent Decree, which was approved by the District Court (Judge Maurice M. Paul) on July 7, 1987, set forth agreed reforms to be implemented in the following areas: assessment, evaluation and placement of juveniles; education; attorney client access; and prohibition of isolation.  The Decree also incorporated previous orders that had been entered by the District Court, as follows:

1. provision of access to counsel (order on stipulated motion in 1987);

2. prohibition against hogtying and shackling to fixed objects, and regulating the use of mechanical restraints (orders dated February 1, 1983 and July 14, 1983);

3. closure of McPherson Training School (order dated August 6, 1985);

4. removal of females from training schools (order dated August 6, 1985);

5. removal of all children 13 years of age and under from training schools (order dated August 6, 1985); and

6. removal of all status offenders from training schools (order dated August 6, 1985).

Following entry of the Decree, the case was then administratively closed.  Monitoring of the implementation process continued for years.

On October 29, 1995, the District Court (Judge Maurice M. Paul) terminated the Consent Decree as to the Dozier Training School.  The Decree remained in effect as to the Eckerd Youth Development Center.   Bobby M. v. Chiles, 907 F.Supp. 368 (N.D.Fla. 1995).  On November 6, 1996, portions of the consent decree relating to ECKERD Youth Development Center were also terminated.

Thereafter, the parties litigated the issue of liability for post-judgment attorney fees and related expenses.  On April 1, 1999, the District Court entered judgment in favor of plaintiffs for attorneys' fees in the amount of $182,912.19, plus costs in the amount of $10,724.90.  Defendants appealed.  While the case was on appeal, the parties settled the issue of fees and costs.

On May 10, 2000, the District Court (Judge Maurice M. Paul) granted defendants' motion to dismiss the remaining claims and the case was closed.  We have no further information on the case.

The document at hand, titled ""Stipulation to Amend Consent Decree,"" is a legal agreement made between the plaintiffs, a group of minors represented by the Florida Institutional Legal Services (FILS), and the defendants, represented by the Department of Health and Rehabilitative Services (HRS). The plaintiffs allege that the conditions at the Eckerd Youth Development Center (EYDC) and the Arthur G.

In October 2005, one of the charging parties intervened in the suit.  A few weeks later in early November, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss.  The second charging party intervened in the suit in mid November.  The defendant's motion to dismiss was denied in January 2006.  After some discovery disputes, one of the charging parties was voluntarily dismissed from the case in late June 2006.  Thereafter, the parties participated in a settlement conference in October 2006, resulting in a tentative settlement.  The parties entered into a final agreement in November 2006 through a consent decree.

The two-year decree, containing non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses, required the defendant to: revise and distribute its sexual harassment policy, post a notice of employee rights, provide Title VII training for all its employees, retain relevant records, report to the EEOC at specified intervals, and pay $150,000.  

The only additional activity that shows up in the docket is the notice to employees that the defendants were required to post as part of the consent decree. Since there appears to be no additional enforcement activity, it is presumed the case closed in November 2008. ","

This document, titled ""Consent Decree between EEOC and Defendant H and M International Transportation, Inc.,"" is a comprehensive settlement agreement between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and H and M International Transportation, Inc. (H&M) to resolve allegations of sexual harassment and discrimination in the workplace. The plaintiffs in this case include the EEOC, acting on behalf of three claimants - Gwendolyn Farley, Anita Evans, and an anonymous plaintiff - who alleged that H&M, through their employee James Nolan, subjected female employees to sexual harassment and created a hostile work environment. Farley, who intervened in the case, specifically claimed that she was subjected to repeated sexual advances, comments, and unwelcome touching by her supervisor, as well as retaliation for rejecting his advances. The EEOC also found evidence of discrimination based on sex and race. The plaintiffs sought monetary relief, including compensation for emotional distress and punitive damages, as well as non-monetary relief such as an injunction against sexual harassment and revisions to H&M's policies and procedures. The defendant, represented by attorney Lawrence W. Byrne, denied all allegations and defended their actions.

EE-NY-0041,"The New York District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against Duane Reade, Inc. in January 2005 in the Southern District of New York. The complaint alleged that three female employees were subjected to sexual harassment by coworkers and their manager; that the Defendant engaged in a pattern or practice of unlawful employment practices; and that the complainants were retaliated against because of their complaints to the EEOC. Also, two of the women experienced sexual harassment because of their pregnancy. All of these actions by the Defendant created a hostile work environment. Because the document and complaint are the only documents available, the nature of the settlement reached by the parties in March 2007 is unknown.

","

In January 2005, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a complaint against Duane Reade Inc., a Delaware corporation operating in New York, for alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and Section 102 of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The complaint accuses Duane Reade of creating a hostile work environment for female employees, discriminating against pregnant employees, and retaliating against those who spoke out against these practices. The plaintiffs, including Mary Asiedu, Iscania Diaz, and Tenika Ferguson, filed charges with the EEOC and are seeking relief from the discriminatory practices. 

The EEOC is represented by lead attorney Judy Keenan, and the defendant is represented by Craig Benson. The jurisdiction for this case is the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Over the course of several court proceedings, including an Interim Pretrial Conference, a Case Management Conference, and a Status/Telephone Conference, the parties discussed settlement and other matters related to the case. In September 2006, a settlement conference was scheduled for the following month. 

During these proceedings, various letters and orders were filed, including a stipulation and order for substitution of counsel for the defendant. In April",0.3706,0.6239,0.465,0.1327,0.2241,0.1667,0.1624,0.2735,0.2038

Specifically, the complaint alleged racial harassment and race based discrimination by subjecting them to harassment and a hostile work environment, and retaliated against them following their complaint about such treatment.  Following some discovery, the parties settled the lawsuit in September 2004 through a consent decree.

The three year decree required the defendant to: make reports on complaints and other compliance reports, keep records, allow access to outsiders for monitoring, hire an outside EEOC consultant, agree not to harass, discriminate or retaliate against their employees, post notice of employee rights, provide annual training to all employees, and pay $375,000 to be distributed among five complaining parties and a fund for unidentified claimants.

The decree was entered in 2004 and scheduled to last 2007. No further docket entries exist, so the case is presumably closed.

The document at hand, titled ""Proposed Consent Decree and Order,"" outlines a Title VII class action lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Earl Scheib, Inc., a nationwide auto paint and body shop company. The lawsuit was brought on behalf of Byron Richardson, Leroy Dee, and other African-American employees who alleged that they were subjected to a hostile work environment and discriminatory treatment based on their race. The EEOC also claimed that the company retaliated against employees who complained about the discriminatory practices. The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a permanent injunction to stop the discrimination, implementation of policies providing equal employment opportunities for African-American employees, and compensation for damages caused by the discrimination. The EEOC was represented by attorneys from the organization and Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLP, while the defendant had their own legal team. The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Nita L. Stormes for court proceedings. After negotiations, the parties reached a proposed consent decree and order, which detailed the terms for relief and compliance measures. These included a monetary relief fund for eligible claimants, revisions to the company's policies on discrimination and harassment, and mandatory training for all employees. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the",0.4076,0.4674,0.4354,0.1048,0.1202,0.112,0.2038,0.2337,0.2177
EE-AZ-0009,"On March 30, 2006, the Phoenix District Office of the EEOC filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiff sued the automobile repairer AutoZone, Inc. under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiff, representing a female employee of AutoZone Inc., asked the court for monetary relief for the complainant and injunctive relief enjoining the defendant from future discrimination on the basis of sex. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that her manager at AutoZone Inc. had sexually harassed her, and that her employer had retaliated against her when she complained of the sexual harassment. 

On June 5, 2008 Judge Stephen M McNamee granted the plaintiff's motion for partial summary judgment with regard to the defendant's affirmative defense. AutoZone Inc. had argued as an affirmative defense that the complainant's previous conviction of disorderly conduct would have constituted termination regardless of her sexual harassment complaints. The Court found this defense lacked sufficient evidence and was merely speculation. AutoZone Inc. further argued an affirmative defense that punitive damages in this case were a violation of the state and federal constitution. Judge McNamee found this affirmative defense erroneous. 

On September 11, 2008 Judge Stephen M McNamee denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment. Judge McNamee ruled that material questions remained with regard to the sexual harassment, the plaintiff's actions following the sexual harassment, and whether the complainant was retaliated against after she filed complaints of sexual harassment. Given these remaining questions, summary judgement was inappropriate. 

The parties then disputed jury instruction. On December 11, 2008, the EEOC provided proposed jury instructions. The defendant claimed that the instructions were incorrect because the plaintiff had not pled that tangible employment action occurred in retaliation to her complaint. On June 1, 2009, Judge McNamee found the instructions proper. The model instructions direct the jury to find whether or not the complainant proved she had suffered a tangible employment action. If found, the defendant was vicariously liable for the manager's conduct, and the defendant's affirmative defense would not be considered. 

On June 10, 2009, a jury found for the plaintiff. The jury found that the plaintiff did experience a hostile work environment, but also found that AutoZone Inc. did not retaliate against the complainant. The jury found AutoZone Inc. liable to the complainant for $15,000 in compensatory damages and $50,000 in punitive damages. 

On June 22, 2009 the defendant moved for a judgment as a matter of law, or alliteratively, a new trial.  On July 24, 2009 Judge McNamee found that there was legally sufficient evidence for the jury finding, and there was not mistake in the case. He denied both motions. 

On June 25, 2009, the EEOC moved to amend the judgment to include equitable relief. On November 9, 2009, Judge McNamee partially granted the EEOC's motion. He granted requests to require training programs, and he granted the request to require updated posters with specific information about Title VII and a complaint process. He denied the motion for a permanent injunction enjoining the defendant from discriminating against employees based on sex because the complainant in this case was the only to come forward with a complaint, and because AutoZone had sufficiently shown that sexual harassment was unlikely to reoccur. He also denied relief requiring the defendant to investigate all employee complaints of sexual harassment from the last three years, relief requiring the defendant to change its complaint process, and relief requiring monitoring and reporting. 

The Defendant then moved for partial reconsideration with regard to new postings on Title VII. One January 6, 2010, Judge McNamee ordered that the original posters may be used as a foundation, but he found three problems that must be corrected. The posters must be updated, they must include EEOC contact information for the Phoenix Field Office, and they must be moved further from the manager's offices. 

On July 23, 2012, Judge McNamee found that the defendant had paid the ordered monetary damages, so he ordered that the bond securing judgment could be released.

This document, titled Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. AutoZone, Inc., is a court decision in a case brought by the EEOC against AutoZone, Inc. The EEOC represented employee Stacy Wing, who alleged that her store manager at AutoZone subjected her to a hostile work environment and retaliated against her for reporting the harassment. The EEOC sought damages on behalf of Wing and requested that AutoZone implement a training program on sexual harassment and post informational posters in all their stores. The defendant's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the hostile work environment and retaliation claims was denied, but granted on the tangible employment action claim. The plaintiff's motion for judgment as a matter of law on the affirmative defenses of hostile work environment and punitive damages was also denied. Following a unanimous jury verdict in favor of the plaintiff on the hostile work environment claim, Wing was awarded $65,000 in compensatory and punitive damages. The court also ordered AutoZone to establish a training program and post informational posters in their stores, with modifications to include contact information. The case was presided over by Judge Stephen M.

DR-CA-0001,"On March 26, 1993, the United States Justice Department filed this lawsuit under Title II of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 42 U.S.C. §§ 2000a et seq. (the Public Accommodations Act), in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California against TW Services and its subsidiary, Denny's, Inc., which operates Denny's Restaurants, alleging discriminatory treatment of African Americans by Denny's restaurants in California. Specifically, the complaint alleged that Denny's implemented terms and conditions for service of black customers, such as the requirement of prepayment and cover charges, that were not required of white patrons, that African Americans received poorer service, and that they were discouraged from patronizing the restaurant. 

The complaint was filed contemporaneously with a consent decree, which was approved by the Court on April 1, 1993. On July 2, 1993, the Court, on its own motion, consolidated the case with Ridgeway v. Denny's Corporation, a class action filed on March 24, 1993, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Both actions alleged violations of the Public Accommodations Act in relation to Denny's treatment of African American customers. The class action also alleged violations of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, 42 U.S.C. § 1985(3), California Business and Professions Code §§ 17200 et seq., California Civil Code §§ 51 et seq. and California Civil Code §§ 1750 et seq.

Following execution of the original decree, numerous complaints of racial discrimination were submitted to the Plaintiff Class and the United States. The United States investigated the complaints and, on May 24, 1994, submitted an amended consent decree to expand the protections to customers and prevent future discrimination. The amended consent decree prohibited Denny's from engaging in discriminatory treatment of African Americans and established procedures for compliance, including a comprehensive non-discrimination training program, as well as provisions for notice, advertising, testing, monitoring and record keeping. It also required the defendants to establish a $28 million settlement fund for the plaintiff class, and appointment of a Special Master. The Amended Consent Decree was given final approval by the Court (Judge James Ware) on July 29, 1994. 

After preliminary approval of the Amended Consent Decree, the parties received reports that a number of individuals and organizations in California were charging fees for services related to the preparation and/or filing of claims in the case. The court (Judge Ware) issued several cease and desist orders to counsel concerning processing of potential claimants. Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 525553 (N.D.Cal. Sept. 22, 1994.), Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 564571 (N.D.Cal. Oct. 3, 1994)).  The court (Judge Ware) also issued orders vacating depositions scheduled by class counsel. Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 665250 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 3, 1994), Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 665243 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 8, 1994), and denying requests of non-party lawyers to amend the judgment and get for fees defending motions to compel. Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 665414 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 8, 1994). The court (Judge Ware) further denied a second motion from the lawyers, vacated a scheduled hearing, and ordered the lawyers to prepare a list of any Denny's claimants who had signed contingency fees with them. Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corporation, Nos. C 93-20202, C 93-20208, 1994 WL 669935 (N.D.Cal. Nov. 18, 1994).

In July and August of 1996 the court issued orders clarifying the confidentiality provisions of the decree and modifying dates for distribution of residual funds. After several years of status reports, the United States submitted a final report on January 16, 2001, recommending early dismissal of the consent decree. On April 4, 2001, the Court (Judge Ware) terminated the consent decree's provisions effective November 11, 2000, and dismissed the case.

This document is a court order in the case of Ridgeway v. Flagstar Corp., a class action lawsuit brought against Denny's for racial discrimination. The plaintiffs, represented by Class Counsel, have filed a motion to compel the deposition testimony of two individuals, Salaam and Jackson, who were associated with a company called Accident Claims Experts (ACE) that advertised services to help individuals file claims against Denny's. The plaintiffs allege that Salaam, Jackson, and attorneys Martin McDonagh and Jerry Varnado were involved in fraudulent representation of potential class members and their claims against Denny's. The plaintiffs seek a list of all claimants contacted by the defendants and a written certification that they do not represent any class members. The court also notes that Salaam's attorney, Hunter, is no longer representing him. Salaam initially refused to answer questions citing his Fifth Amendment rights, while Jackson claimed he was not properly served with a subpoena. The court ordered the defendants to provide the requested information and also issued a show cause order for McDonagh and Varnado to explain their failure to appear for depositions. The case ultimately resulted in a settlement agreement, the Amended Consent Decree, which required Denny's to pay $27 million in damages to affected customers and",0.5924,0.1855,0.2825,0.1762,0.055,0.0838,0.2654,0.0831,0.1266
ID-VA-0002,"On May 4, 1990, the United States Department of Justice Civil Rights Division announced, in a letter to the Governor of Virginia, its intent to launch an investigation, pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997 et seq., into conditions at the Northern Virginia Training Center (NVTC), an institution for individuals with developmental disabilities in Fairfax, Virginia.  Five experts from the Department of Justice toured the facility, reviewed policies and procedures, interviewed NVTC staff, and audited reporting and investigation practices.  

On April 9, 1991, the Department of Justice announced its findings.  The Department of Justice reported that the health and safety of people living at NVTC was at risk for a number of reasons.  NVTC employed too few people and inadequately trained those it did employ, which placed residents in danger of unnecessary chemical and physical restraint.  Often mechanical restraints were accompanied by seclusion, which was a fire hazard.  Individualized programming for residents was inadequate and recordkeeping deficiencies made it impossible to monitor an individual's progress.  In addition, NVTC's medical care, physical therapy, occupational therapy, and medication and side effect monitoring we all inadequate.  In addition, NVTC provided insufficient medical care, including medication monitoring and occupational therapy.  Recordkeeping made it difficult to track the efficacy of individualized programming and medical care.  In closing, the Department of Justice expressed the desire to negotiate a resolution.

Negotiations did not make enough progress and, on May 31, 1994, the Department of Justice threatened to file a CRIPA lawsuit to challenge the constitutionality of conditions at NVTC.  In addition to its earlier concerns, the Department of Justice chronicled systematic abuse and neglect at NVTC.  For instance, individualized training programs were so inadequate that individuals became seriously sick or died as the result of aggressive, pica, and other self-injurious behaviors.  One resident asphyxiated on a rubber glove, while another ate a reported seven cigarettes and one feminine hygiene pad in the span of two days.  Similarly, inappropriate feeding techniques and poor nutrition endangered residents' health. 

Virginia may have made an effort engage in productive negotiations, but the Department of Justice was not satisfied.  On February 8, 1995, the Department of Justice notified the Governor of Virginia that, in addition to being unconstitutional, the conditions at NVTC violated the Americans With Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12101 et seq., Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. §§ 794, the Social Security Act (""Medicaid""), 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq., and Virginia law.

On March 4, 1996, the Department of Justice filed a CRIPA lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, challenging conditions at NVTC.  The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to address (1) individualized programming, (2) undue physical restraint and isolation, (3) facility safety, (4) medical care, (5) physical and occupational therapy, (6) medication monitoring, especially for tardive dyskenesia, and (7) staff numbers and training.  

On May 21, 1996, the court (Judge Leonie M. Brinkema) refused to consolidate this lawsuit with United States v. Virginia, No. 96-284, MH-VA-0002, an action challenging the constitutionality of conditions at a Virginia psychiatric hospital.  On May 21, 1996, the court also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, but stayed its ruling to allow for settlement.  On July 18, 1996, the court approved a settlement agreement.

The settlement agreement itself was mostly concerned with procedural elements, such as development of a plan for improvement, compliance deadlines, evaluation, and dismissal.  The NVTC plan describes the required compliance.  The plan emphasizes the importance of trained staff in the provision of developmental disability services.  The plan stated detailed training requirements for direct care staff and incorporated training into almost every solution.  For instance, the plan mandated the dismissal of employees who neglected or abused residents.  Similarly, the plan sought to reduce the need for restraints by both improving staff development and requiring the interdisciplinary treatment teams' advance approval for the type of restraints to be used for each individual.  Thus, both chemical restraints and draconian physical restraint techniques, such as papoose boards, were eliminated.  Similar clauses addressed medical care, medication administration and tracking, physical and occupational therapy, abuse and injury reporting and investigations, recordkeeping, functional planning, community placement, and quality assurance.  

The parties modified the settlement on May 30, 1997.  On August 29, 1997, the Department of Justice inspected NVTC and found it was in compliance with the plan.  On June 3, 1998, the court dismissed the lawsuit.

This collection of documents pertains to a civil action, titled ""Settlement Agreement Between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America Regarding Northern Virginia Training Center,"" which arose from a dispute between the Commonwealth of Virginia and the United States of America. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys Janet Hill and David H. Lawson, alleged that the Northern Virginia Training Center, under the direction of Governor George Allen, Secretary Robert C. Metcalf, Commissioner Timothy A. Kelly, Janet W. Hill, and David H. Lawson, had failed to provide adequate medical care for a patient, RWKt K«HBBi, resulting in a spiral fracture in both legs. The United States sought relief for these violations under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), including improved treatment and care for individuals with disabilities, and appropriate use of restraints. The attorneys involved in the case included Richard Parker, an Assistant United States Attorney, and William H. Hurd, the Deputy Attorney General for the Commonwealth of Virginia. After several years of on-site inspections and evaluations, the case proceeded to court, with the defendants filing a motion to dismiss and a separate motion for a more definite statement. A scheduling order was issued, setting",0.599,0.1658,0.2597,0.1893,0.0522,0.0818,0.314,0.0869,0.1361
CJ-ID-0003,"On September 22, 2016, this complaint was filed under 42 U.S.C. §1983 on behalf of 104 unnamed sexual offenders, identified as John or Jane Does, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Idaho against the Idaho Attorney General, the Idaho Department of Corrections, and the Idaho State Police Force. The plaintiffs alleged that Idaho’s Sexual Offender Registration Notification and Community Right-to-Know Act was unconstitutionally vague in violation of the Due Process and the Ex Post Facto clauses of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs also alleged that the Sex Offender Registry and accompanying statutes further violated the Substantive Due Process, Equal Protection, Double Jeopardy, Contracts, and Takings clauses of the U.S. and Idaho Constitutions. 

The plaintiffs were from across the country. Most were convicted of sexual offenses in 1980s and 1990s. One of their major complaints was that subsequent amendments to Idaho’s sex-offender registry laws amounted to unconstitutional retroactive punishment. For example, John Doe 100, of Bannock County, was convicted of a misdemeanor sexual offense in Montana in 1996. His offense did not require registration in Montana. He moved to Idaho in 2005 and was not required to register until 2007, 11 years after his conviction, when Idaho authorities reclassified his offense as a felony rather than the original misdemeanor. 

The plaintiffs sought a permanent order to stop the state and its counties from enforcing specific provisions of the Sex Offender Registry and accompanying statutes and laws. An amended complaint was filed on Apr. 26, 2017, which argued that the defendants further violated the plaintiffs' rights to: acquire, possess and protect property; seek and obtain safety and happiness; travel, life and liberty; and freedom of association and religion protected by the U.S. and Idaho Constitutions. The complaint argued that the Registry and accompanying laws were unconstitutional both facially and as-applied. 

The case was assigned to Judge David C. Nye on Aug. 2, 2017.

On Nov. 17, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim. A hearing was held on March 6, 2018 before Judge Nye. On May 17, 2018, Judge Nye granted the defendants’ motion to dismiss and granted the plaintiffs leave to file a second amended complaint to cure deficiencies identified. Specifically, the plaintiffs must identify actual harms suffered by one or more “Does” and present sufficient facts upon which the court can make a reasoned decision. 2018 WL 2275220.

On August 30, 2018, the plaintiffs filed the second amended complaint against the defendants. The defendants filed another motion to dismiss on October 18, 2018. A hearing was held on March 12, 2019. 

On April 5, 2019, Judge Nye granted the motion to dismiss again and dismissed the second amended complaint with prejudice. The court reasoned that the plaintiffs added facts with respect to twelve defendants in the second amended complaint but failed to tie such facts to specific constitutional violations and allege essential details that would allow the court to evaluate whether any of the allegations are plausible. The plaintiffs also ignored most of the arguments raised in the defendants’ motion to dismiss and failed to cite any binding authority to support their arguments. Accordingly, Judge Nye dismissed this case. 2019 WL 1508037.

On May 5, 2019, the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. As of January 20, 2020, this case is pending in the Court of Appeals.

The document in question is an amended complaint, titled ""John Doe 116, et al. v. State of Idaho, et al."", filed by a group of plaintiffs challenging the constitutionality of the Idaho Sex Offender Registration Act (SORA). The plaintiffs, including John Doe 116, are all registered sex offenders in Idaho, and they allege that the amendments made to SORA in 2001 and 2009 violate their due process rights. The defendant in this case is the State of Idaho, represented by the Idaho Sex Offender Registry and the Idaho Department of Correction. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU of Idaho and private attorneys, seek to be removed from the registry and to be free from the stigma and restrictions that come with being a registered sex offender. The court proceedings began in 2018, and the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint in two parts, consisting of 18 documents. The first part likely contains additional information or modifications to the original complaint. The plaintiffs have also filed a response to the defendant's motion to dismiss, which was granted by the court.

The policy at issue required that all persons to be housed in the Detention Center be strip searched for weapons and contraband, regardless of the offense charged and whether or not there was individualized reasonable suspicion that the search would lead to the discovery of contraband or weapons. Plaintiffs maintained that the policy violated the Fourth Amendment's ban on unreasonable searches and seizures.  They sought monetary damages and injunctive relief. Management & Training Corporation (the company that was contracted to operated the Detention Center), the Santa Fe County Board of Commissioners and Santa Fe County Sheriffs were named as defendants.

From January 2005 through November 2005, the parties engaged in extensive discovery, including document production, numerous depositions, inspection of the Detention Center and analysis of over 31,000 individual booking records.  Settlement talks began in 2005 and included a six day mediation session before retired District Court Judge Raul A. Ramirez of California.  Negotiations continued until a deal was reached in June 2006.

On July 24, 2006, the District Court (District Judge Bruce D. Black) preliminarily approved the Stipulation of Settlement and certified the case as a class action.

Following a fairness hearing, the District Court entered its final order approving the settlement and closing the case on December 8, 2006.  Under the terms of the settlement, defendants agreed to pay $8.5 million into a settlement fund.  Up to $5,529,750.00, plus interest earned on the settlement fund, would be allocated to pay verified claims.  If the total amount of verified claims exceeded that amount, the amount payable to each member for each claim would be proportionately reduced.  If the total amount of verified claims was less than that amount, the balance would be refunded to the defendants. $2 million was allocated for attorneys' fees and costs, and $470,250.00 was allocated equally among the class representatives. Up to $500,000 was to be paid for claims administration costs, with restrictions to come into play if administration expenses incurred were more or less than that amount.  

The case is now closed.","

NS-NY-0024,"The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) requires the government to obtain a warrant from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC) before it may conduct any domestic electronic surveillance to acquire foreign intelligence information. The warrant applications are made ex parte and must include a sworn statement by a federal officer of the facts and circumstances relied upon to justify the government's belief that the target of surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Once a FISC judge receives a warrant application, the judge can order approval of the surveillance only if the judge finds that there is probable cause to believe that the target of the electronic surveillance is a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Because the orders only authorize surveillance up to 90 days, the government must file an application for an extension that meets the same requirements as the initial warrant application and obtain a renewal order from the FISC for continued surveillance. For the Civil Rights Litigation Clearinghouse collection of FISA matters, see our <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?searchSpecialCollection=20"">special collection</a>.

On January 29, 2018, the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence (HPSCI) voted to disclose a memorandum (the Nunes Memo) revealing existence of a FISA warrant for the electronic surveillance of Carter Page, who served as a onetime foreign policy advisor to the Trump Campaign until September 2016. The Nunes Memo was declassified by President Donald Trump on February 2, 2018. The Nunes Memo revealed that on October 21, 2016, the Department of Justice (DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) sought and received a probable cause order from the FISC authorizing electronic surveillance on Carter Page. The Nunes Memo further disclosed that in addition to the initial warrant application, the government had received three renewal orders from the FISC.

On February 6, 2018, reporters Adam Goldman and Charlie Savage, along with the New York Times, filed a motion in the FISC for release of all court records, including opinions and application materials, in reference to the surveillance of Carter Page. See Misc. 18-01, <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16844"">NS-DC-0126</a> in this Clearinghouse.

On March 7, 2018, reporter Charlie Savage and the New York Times Company also filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for the same documents they requested in their FISC motion: the release of all documents regarding the surveillance of Carter Page.

On July 21, 2018, the DOJ produced redacted documents it considered responsive to the FOIA request. See In re Carter W. Page, <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17114"">NS-DC-0127</a> in this Clearinghouse.

On August 9, 2018, the parties stipulated to settle their claims. In exchange for The Times's agreement to dismiss this action, the DOJ agreed to provide to the Times any additional documents responsive to The Times's FOIA Request that are released in any related actions. On August 9, 2018, United States District Judge Analisa Torres approved the settlement. The case is now closed.","

The document in question is a compilation of various filings from a court case between The New York Times Company and journalist Charlie Savage as plaintiffs, and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as the defendant. The case, filed in the Southern District of New York, centers around a complaint against the DOJ for failing to comply with a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request. The plaintiffs, a media company and one of its reporters, allege that the DOJ, led by Attorney General Jeff Sessions, has not provided the requested documents related to the surveillance of a target believed to be an agent of the Russian government. The plaintiffs seek an order from the court to compel the DOJ to produce the requested records.

The attorneys representing The Times and Savage are David McCraw and Andrew E. Krause, respectively. Throughout the proceedings, the parties have filed various documents, including a complaint, a corporate disclosure statement, a request for a summons, and a joint letter proposing a schedule. The court has granted extensions and set new dates for the initial pretrial conference, but ultimately a settlement was reached between The Times and the DOJ.

The settlement agreement stipulates that the DOJ will provide the requested documents and a publicly-released Vaughn Index from related actions in exchange for the dismissal of the case",0.6652,0.2707,0.3848,0.2318,0.0941,0.1339,0.3032,0.1234,0.1754
PB-CA-0048,"On October 16, 2014, three individuals with significant physical disabilities requiring substantial medical care filed this lawsuit against the California Department of Health Care Services (“DHCS”) in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiffs alleged that the state had violated Section II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, which require public entities to provide services to persons with disabilities in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs and to prevent unnecessary institutionalization. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, including a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction preventing DHCS from reducing at-home medical care and support for the plaintiffs, and a permanent injunction preventing unnecessary institutionalization in the future. They also sought attorney’s fees. The plaintiffs were represented by Disability Rights California.

At the time, the plaintiffs, who were once institutionalized because of their disabilities, were living in their own homes where they received Medicaid-funded nursing and attendant care through the California Medi-Cal Home and Community Based Nursing Facility/Acute Hospital Waiver Program (“Waiver Program”). They alleged that they were at risk of institutionalization because DHCS maintained unnecessarily low cost limits for these services.

On January 29, 2015, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint. The amended complaint added an organizational plaintiff, In Spirit, a non-profit organization that provided financial assistance to persons with disabilities to receive medical care in their home. 
 
On July 7, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. This complaint added a new named plaintiff, dismissed one of the existing named plaintiffs, elaborated on the factual allegations, and added a third claim for violations of California state law. On September 23, 2015, In Spirit was voluntarily dismissed as a party in the lawsuit. 

On January 26, 2016, the parties held a mediation session but were unable to reach an agreement. Throughout the mediation, the parties continued to engage in discovery. On March 8, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. On March 10, 2016, the plaintiffs moved for summary judgement. District Judge Fernando Olguin denied both motions on April 27, 2016. He further set out deadlines for continued discovery.
 
On March 29, 2016, the United States Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division (""DOJ"") filed a statement of interest to clarify the defendant’s obligations under the ADA. The DOJ explained that the ADA prohibits unjustified institutionalization and requires individuals with disabilities receive support and services in the most integrated setting as mandated in Olmstead v. L.C., 527 U.S. 581 (1999). The DOJ also clarified that the defendants could not administer the Medicaid waiver without accounting for individual needs and that the integration mandate protects individuals at serious risk of institutionalization. The DOJ filed subsequent statements of interest on August 4, 2016 and September 16, 2016, which further clarified the states’ ADA obligations in light of DHCS’s arguments against the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgement.

On July 18, 2016, the plaintiffs again moved for summary judgement, which Judge Olguin denied on August 4, 2016 due to continued factual disputes. Judge Olguin also noted being “deeply troubled” by the defendants’ repeated failure to comply in good faith with discovery requests and threatened to impose sanctions.

On September 7, 2016, the plaintiffs again filed a motion for summary judgement. On June 5, 2017, the Court denied that motion, finding that genuine issues of material fact remained regarding whether or not the California waiver program’s cost limits created a serious risk of institutionalization and whether California had an existing deinstitutionalization scheme in place that was effective. 385 F. Supp. 3d 1048. 

The parties continued with discovery, and it appears they continued engaging in settlement talks as well. On March 14, 2018, the plaintiffs moved to voluntarily dismiss their case without prejudice, and on March 19, 2018, the court granted this motion for voluntary dismissal of most of the case. There was some continued litigation over whether the plaintiffs were entitled to costs and attorneys’ fees. 

The dismissal seems to come from the fact that DHCS eventually changed the waiver application process so that decisions would be based on medical necessity without any mention of cost limits. In their motion opposing attorneys’ fees, the defendants asserted that this made the plaintiffs' claims moot, and that there was no basis for awarding attorneys’ fees or costs. The plaintiffs argued that the overall course of events demonstrated that this litigation was a significant factor prompting defendants to eliminate waiver cost limits, which created a presumption that plaintiffs were a catalyst and, because defendants could not rebut that presumption, plaintiffs were entitled to attorneys fees’ and costs under a state statute. 

On May 30, 2019, Judge Olguin granted the plaintiffs’ motion for attorneys fees. The court found that the litigation led to the elimination of DHCS’s cost limits, conferring a significant benefit for potentially thousands of people. The elimination of cost limits would ensure that participants would not have to resort to litigation to secure needed services and that they would be able to remain in their homes and avoid segregation and isolation. The court ordered the plaintiffs to file their motion for attorneys’ fees and costs no later than July 31, 2019. 2019 WL 2590170. 

After a brief delay, the parties agreed on how much the defendants should pay in attorneys’ fees. They notified the court that they had resolved all outstanding issues in this case on November 22, 2019. The notification did not state the size of the award, so the Clearinghouse is unaware of the amount. The case is now closed. ","

This document, ""California Attorney Fee Awards § 3.58: Plaintiffs' Motion for Attorney's Fees and Costs Granted, Defendants' Motion Denied,"" discusses the case of Jerry Thomas et al. v. Jennifer Kent, DHCS, in which plaintiffs, individuals with disabilities, brought a class action lawsuit against the defendants, the California Department of Health Care Services (DHCS) and its director, Jennifer Kent. The plaintiffs, including Jerry Thomas, Sean Benison, and Juan Palomares, are individuals with severe disabilities who require 24-hour care and specialized medical technologies to manage their conditions. They alleged that the defendants' policy of imposing individual cost limits on Waiver services, which provide necessary support for individuals to remain in their communities and avoid institutionalization, was unlawful and discriminatory. The plaintiffs sought an injunction to eliminate the cost limits and an award of attorney's fees and costs under California Civil Code § 1021.5. The defendants argued that their actions were substantially justified and that an ad hoc exception process was in place for individuals who required services above the cost limits. However, the court rejected these arguments, finding that the plaintiffs had met all criteria for an award of attorney's fees and that the defendants' actions were not substantially justified.

FH-NC-0002,"On September 13, 2012, the United States filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina against Bank of America, alleging violations of the Fair Housing Act and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act. Specifically, the federal government alleged that Bank of America discriminated against disabled mortgage applicants by requiring all disabled applicants to submit a letter from their doctors indicating the amount of the disability income they received. In some cases, the U.S. claimed that Bank of America required disabled loan applicants to provide information about the nature and severity of their disability as a condition of receiving a mortgage. The federal government further alleged that Bank of America discriminated against applicants receiving public assistance in violation of the Equal Credit Opportunities Act. The federal government asked the court for an injunction as well as monetary damages.

A consent order was submitted on October 10, 2012 and later amended on December 6. The Court (Chief Judge Robert J. Conrad, Jr.) approved the order, which prohibited Bank of America from requiring applicants to submit a letter from a doctor and required Bank of America to institute a monitoring program, train staff on the new policies, maintain a complaint resolution program, and to compensate affected applicants. According to the press release from the Department of Justice, Bank of America paid a minimum of $370 million in the settlement to about 200,000 borrowers. The order was to remain in effect for 42 months following the approval date.  

On June 5, 2013, the case was reassigned to Magistrate Judge David S. Cayer. The consent order terminated without any further litigation, and the case is now closed.","

Bank of America, N.A.

The plaintiffs in the case, Steven Danczak, David Van Wagnen, and Renee Mill, were represented by attorneys from the United States Department of Justice and relied on Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) income. The defendant, Bank of America, was a bank holding company accused of discriminatory practices in the processing and underwriting of mortgage loans for individuals with disabilities. The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of monetary damages, punitive damages, and injunctive relief, while the United States also sought civil penalties against the defendant.
After an investigation and attempts at conciliation, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) issued a Charge of Discrimination against Bank of America.

IM-MD-0013,"On November 21, 2019, three refugee resettlement agencies filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, challenging the Trump Administration's recent Executive Order, ""Enhancing State and Local Involvement in Refugee Resettlement."" The agencies (HIAS, Inc., Church World Service, Inc., and Lutheran Immigration & Refugee Service, Inc.), represented by the International Refugee Assistance Project (IRAP), sued President Trump, the Department of State, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Health and Human Services. The plaintiffs alleged that the President’s September 26, 2019, Executive Order violated the Refugee Act of 1980, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 et seq.), and principles of federalism. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief, as well as a preliminary and permanent injunction to enjoin enforcement of the Order. The case was assigned to Judge Peter J. Messitte.

The plaintiffs alleged that Executive Order 13888 made an unprecedented change to the refugee resettlement process by mandating that refugees not be resettled in the United States unless the state and locality where they are to be resettled take the affirmative step of providing written consent. As national refugee resettlement agencies, the plaintiffs were then charged by the federal government with the responsibility of soliciting and obtaining written consent from all states and localities where refugees they assist could be resettled. The plaintiffs claimed that such a change would provide individual states and local governments with effective veto power over refugee resettlement. 

The plaintiffs filed their motion for a preliminary injunction on November 22, 2019. Judge Messitte granted the plaintiffs’ motion on January 15. 2020 WL 218646. Judge Messitte concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims, that they faced irreparable harm, and that the Executive Order was not in the public interest. Consequently, he issued a nationwide injunction enjoining the Executive Order.

The government appealed the injunction to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on February 12, 2020 (Do. 20-1160), and Judge Messitte stayed the proceedings in the district court pending resolution of that appeal on February 14, 2020. 

On January 8, 2021, Circuit Judge Barbara Milano Keenan upheld the preliminary injunction. 985 F.3d 309. The court held that the plaintiffs demonstrated that they were likely to succeed on their claim that the order and notice violated the Refugee Act. The court also determined that the district court did not abuse its discretion in issuing a nationwide injunction because the refugee resettlement programs were, by their nature. located throughout the country.

The case is ongoing.","

This case, Hias, Inc. v. Trump, involves a legal challenge against an executive order issued by President Trump that requires state and local authorities to provide written consent before refugees can be resettled in their jurisdictions. The plaintiffs, Hias, Inc., Church World Service, and Lutheran Immigration & Refugee Service, are non-profit organizations with a long history of assisting refugees, and individual refugees who have been assigned to the nine resettlement agencies affected by the order. They argue that the order is unconstitutional and violates the Refugee Act of 1980, which grants Congress the authority to make decisions on refugee placement. The defendant is the Trump administration, specifically the Secretary of State, who is responsible for implementing the order. The plaintiffs allege that the order is causing them to divert resources and potentially lose their nonprofit tax status, and it is putting the lives of thousands of refugees and their families at risk. They are seeking an injunction to stop the harm and prevent further damage. The attorneys involved include Steven H Schulman, representing plaintiffs Arthur E.

FA-GA-0001,"On October 5, 2012, the Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta, the Catholic Diocese of Savannah, and affiliated Catholic organizations filed this U.S. District Court lawsuit in the Northern District of Georgia against the Federal Government under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the First and Fifth Amendments, and as a violation of the Constitution's Separation of Powers provisions.  Plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, seek to enjoin enforcement of provisions of the Affordable Care Act (ACA) extending universal contraception coverage in employer-sponsored private health insurance coverage.  Plaintiffs contend that this mandatory contraception coverage violates their sincerely held religious beliefs.

Plaintiffs amended their complaint a first time on December 31, 2012, and a second time on August 19, 2013 to challenge the ACA as amended by the 2013 Final Rules. They argued that while the Diocese itself likely fell within the ""religious employer"" exception, the affiliated Catholic entities did not and, instead, were considered ""eligible organizations"" qualifying for an accommodation. The accommodation would require plaintiffs to provide self-certification to their insurance provider setting forth their religious objections to the ACA, in turn trigging an obligation on the part of the insurance provider to procure the services plaintiffs find objectionable. According to the plaintiffs, this series of events makes them the but-for cause of providing contraception coverage in violation of their sincerely held beliefs. Plaintiffs continued to ask the court to grant a permanent injunction against enforcement of the relevant provisions of the ACA.

On March 26, 2014, the District Court (Judge William S. Duffey, Jr.) permanently enjoined the government from enforcing the contraceptive mandate against plaintiffs. 2014 WL 1256373. The court noted that the contraception mandate, including the self-certification form, placed a substantial burden on plaintiffs by compelling them to affirmatively modify their behavior and violate their religious beliefs. The court also held that the general applicability of the law was not a compelling state interest nor was the conception mandate the least restrictive means of furthering that interest. On May 23, 2014, the government appealed this case to the Eleventh Circuit. 

On May 30, 2014, Judge Duffey issued an opinion and order in response to the government's motion for Reconsideration on the Dioceses' RFRA and free exercise claims. 2014 WL 2441742. The government had also asked the court to reconsider whether or not the affiliated entities maintained a ""church plan"" under ERISA. If they did, they would be exempt from the self-certification requirement, and not have standing to challenge the mandate. Judge Duffey held that the Dioceses' RFRA and free exercise claims should be dismissed, and clarified that the affiliated organizations did not need to establish that they were church plans, because the self-certification requirement was a substantial burden on their religious exercise. 

This case was consolidated on appeal with <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13619"">Eternal Word Television Network v. Sebelius</a>. On February 18, 2016, the Eleventh Circuit (Judge Jill Pryor) held that the contraception mandate does not violate the RFRA because it is the least restrictive means of achieving a compelling government interest, but enjoined enforcement of the mandate against the plaintiffs because the issue of whether the accommodation violates the RFRA was currently before the Supreme Court. 818 F.3d 1122. 

On May 31, 2016, following the Supreme Court's decision in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13465"">Zubik v. Sebelius [II]</a> that religious nonprofits and the government should return the related cases to the courts of appeals and attempt to negotiate a solution, the Eleventh Circuit vacated their February 19, 2016 order in this case, and directed the parties to submit supplemental briefing. 

On July 29, 2016 the parties jointly moved for a stay in the proceedings that was granted on August 10, 2016. The parties were ordered to file status reports sixty days after the given order. 

Also on August 10, 2016, the defendants moved for an order materially identical to the remand orders the Supreme Court issued in <i> Zubik </i>. The defendants moved for this motion because they wanted to modify the existing injunction against them and have the ability to tell insurance issuers and third party administrators of their requirement to make separate payments for contraceptives given the plaintiffs met the requirements under the accommodation. This would ensure the affected women that would be under the plaintiffs insurance receive coverage while the litigation continued. The plaintiffs opposed the motion. 

On October 3, 2016, the court granted the defendant's motion for materially identical orders. The new injunction stated: 

“As such, we modify the injunction entered on May 31, 2016 to add that: Nothing in this opinion, [in this Court's prior opinion or orders], or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, is to affect the ability of the Government to ensure that women covered by the [plaintiffs'] health plans ""obtain, without cost, the full range of FDA approved contraceptives."" Through this litigation, [plaintiffs] have made the Government aware of their view that they meet ""the requirements for exemption from the contraceptive coverage requirement on religious grounds. Nothing in this opinion, [in this Court's prior opinions or orders], or in the opinions or orders of the courts below, ""precludes the Government from relying on this notice, to the extent it considers it necessary, to facilitate the provision of frill contraceptive coverage"" going forward. Because the Government may rely on this notice, the Government may not impose taxes or penalties on [plaintiffs] for failure to provide the relevant notice.”

Both parties filed status reports on October 11, 2016, stating the defendants were sorting through the 52,000 comments received during the governments’ Request for Information (RFI) and required additional time to determine if modifications were necessary to accommodate the Religious Freedom Restoration Act claim still pending. 

The parties then continued to file monthly status reports with no changes to the case until October 16, 2017. However, during this time President Trump issued an executive order in May of 2017, called the ""Executive Order Promoting Free Speech and Religious Liberty"". As a result, on October 6, 2017, the US Department of Health and Human Services released a statement explaining the changes in policy related to President Trump's executive order requiring HHS to consider amending the accommodation requirements under the ACA for the contraception mandate. The new policy would expand the exception to fit entities that had sincerely held religious beliefs opposed to providing contraception. 
<a href=""https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2017/10/06/trump-administration-issues-rules-protecting-the-conscience-rights-of-all-americans.html""> Here is an article from HHS describing the change.</a>

On October 16, 2017, the parties jointly moved to dismiss the case, with each party bearing its own costs. 

On November 7, 2017, the court dismissed the appeal. 

This case is now presumed closed.

The document titled ""Archdiocese of Atlanta et al. v. Sebelius et al."" is a legal case that centers around the controversial contraceptive mandate in the Affordable Care Act (ACA). The plaintiffs, which include the Archdiocese of Atlanta and the Diocese of Savannah, are Catholic religious organizations that provide various services to the community. They argue that the mandate, which requires them to provide insurance coverage for contraception, violates their religious beliefs and their First Amendment rights. On the other side, the defendants, represented by government officials Kathleen Sebelius and Timothy Geithner, argue that the mandate is necessary to ensure equal access to healthcare for women.

The plaintiffs, represented by attorney Edward Kendrick Smith, seek relief from the court in the form of a permanent injunction against the enforcement of the mandate. The defendants, represented by attorney Michael Pollack, argue against the injunction and stand firm on the importance of the mandate. The court proceedings involve several key moments, including a motion for summary judgment filed by the plaintiffs, which is ultimately granted by the court. The court finds that the mandate does indeed violate the plaintiffs' rights under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA) and issues permanent injunctions against its enforcement.

IM-CA-0104,"This action, filed by the City of Los Angeles, California on Sept. 29, 2017, challenged the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ)'s imposition of immigration-related conditions on federal funding to the city. The plaintiff, represented by its legal department and the law firm Covington & Burling, filed its complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief.

Los Angeles receives federal funding through the Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grant (Byrne JAG) Program and the Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Program, both administered by the DOJ and its component agencies Office of Justice Programs (OJP) and Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA). The latest DOJ requirements for FY2017 program funding imposed new conditions on recipient cities, including Los Angeles. One condition was compliance with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that a local government entity cannot prohibit or restrict communication between government entities or officials and federal immigration authorities. The other two conditions required recipients to allow the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to access any correctional or detention facility and question suspected undocumented immigrants about their right to be in the U.S., and to provide DHS at least 48 hours advance notice of any noncitizen's scheduled release from custody. 

After several lawsuits challenged these conditions, the federal government was preliminarily enjoined from imposing them on Byrne JAG funding in <i><a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16080"">City of Chicago v. Sessions</a></i>. The DOJ continued to revise these conditions, but Los Angeles believed the revised requirements were ambiguous. Los Angeles alleged that accepting these conditions would force it to abandon its longstanding law enforcement policies, intended to improve cooperation between immigrant residents and municipal police. These policies restrict the city from seeking and disclosing information about residents' immigration status, as well as from honoring Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detainer requests without an independent warrant or judicial determination of probable cause.

Los Angeles explained its view that its policies in fact complied with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, but that the notice and access conditions were so ambiguous that the DOJ could continue to wrongly deny Los Angeles the funding. Additionally, the city believed that Congress did not intend these immigration-related conditions in either the Byrne JAG statute or the COPS statute. Los Angeles argued that the access and notification requirements would compel it to choose between either submitting to an unconstitutional federal enforcement agenda, or losing critical funds.  The city contended that this violated the U.S. Constitution's separation of powers, the Spending Clause (by usurping Congress' ability to set conditions for funding), the Tenth Amendment (by usurping Los Angeles's power over its own municipal policy), and the Administrative Procedure Act (as arbitrary and capricious agency action). 

On the same day that it filed its complaint, Los Angeles also moved for a preliminary injunction, pointing to what it described as the irreparable injury from the loss of critical public-safety funds. 

The case was assigned to Judge Manuel L. Real on Oct. 2, 2017.

On Oct. 4, 2017 the parties moved for an expedited briefing schedule, because the DOJ expected to make FY2017 COPS funding decisions on or around Oct. 30. Judge Real granted the motion and planned for a hearing to be held on Oct. 23.

The DOJ, in its response to the city's complaint, argued against the preliminary injunction, asserting that the city lacked standing (as it would not have been a successful COPS applicant anyway in FY2017, regardless of the immigration-related factors); that COPS' immigration-related factors were consistent with the program's purposes under the APA; and that the DOJ had broad discretion to make the grants.

Los Angeles withdrew its motion for preliminary injunction on Oct. 16, 2017 because the DOJ had disclosed that Los Angeles' award application for this cycle would have been unsuccessful even without the immigration-related considerations. However, Los Angeles maintained its claims and request for permanent relief, because the DOJ continued to attach the immigration-related conditions to the COPS program.

On Nov. 21, 2017 Los Angeles then moved for partial summary judgment, arguing that the DOJ's use of COPS funding conditions violated the separation of powers, the Spending Clause, and the APA as arbitrary and capricious. On Feb. 1, five counties, seven cities, and the District of Columbia filed amici briefs supporting Los Angeles.

The DOJ also moved for partial summary judgment on Jan. 12, 2018 arguing that Los Angeles' claims were non-justiciable or, in the alternative, that the funding conditions were consistent with the governing statutes, the Spending Clause, and the APA. 

Judge Real held a motion hearing on Feb. 28, 2018, and on Apr. 11, 2018 issued an order granting Los Angeles' partial summary judgment motion and denying the DOJ's. First, Judge Real held that the case was not moot because Los Angeles' harm was capable of repetition if the City applied for a FY2018 grant. As to the substantive claims, Judge Real held that the challenged conditions exceeded DOJ's legal authority (as federal power infringing on the state police power), in violation of the Spending Clause (because Congress did not unambiguously condition grant receipt on local compliance with federal authorities for a matter not reasonably related to COPS's goal), and in violation of the APA (as arbitrary and capricious without a reasonable basis). Judge Real then permanently enjoined the DOJ from imposing the challenged conditions nationwide. In doing so, Judge Real held that Los Angeles would suffer irreparable harm in future grant cycles against its competitors, making a nationwide injunction necessary. The government appealed to the Ninth Circuit.

On July 12, 2019, the Ninth Circuit reversed the district court's summary judgment in favor of Los Angeles. 929 F.3d 1163. The Court rejected the plaintiff's claims that the DOJ's use of certain factors in scoring applicants for COPS grants violated the Spending Clause or the Tenth Amendment. The Court also held that the DOJ did not exceed its statutory authority or act arbitrarily and capriciously. The plaintiffs requested rehearing, but the Ninth Circuit denied to rehear the appeal. On December 23, 2019, the district court dissolved and vacated the April 11 injunction in accordance with the Ninth Circuit's ruling.

Meanwhile, back in the district court, Judge Real had stayed Los Angeles' Byrne JAG claims pending one of the following events: (a) the nationwide injunction issued in City of Chicago v. Sessions is dissolved, in which case proceedings on these claims would resume; or (b) the case results in a nationwide permanent injunction of the challenged Byrne JAG conditions, after all opportunities for appeal were exhausted. 

On July 18, 2018, the plaintiff filed a motion for a preliminary injunction of the Byrne JAG funding conditions. 

On Sept. 13, 2018, Judge Real granted Los Angeles' application for a preliminary injunction, enjoining the notice and access conditions imposed upon the Byrne JAG grant. The court held that the statutes did not grant the Attorney General authority to impose such conditions. The court also held that Los Angeles faced irreparable harm because it was forced to make ""an impossible choice: either it must certify compliance with unconstitutional and unlawful directives that impinge on the City's sovereignty, damage community trust, and harm public safety, or it will lose congressionally authorized Byrne JAG funding."" The government appealed this order to the Ninth Circuit, which then docketed the appeal as No. 18-56292. Four days later, the district court denied the government's motion to dismiss. 

On October 31, 2019, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court's preliminary injunction against the DOJ's use of the notice and access conditions on recipients of Byrne JAG grants. 941 F.3d 931. The Court found that the DOJ lacked statutory authority to impose the conditions.

On December 31, 2019, the case was reassigned to Judge Josephine L. Staton. 

In light of the Ninth Circuit finding that the DOJ lacked statutory authority to impose the notice and access conditions on the Byrne JAG grants, Judge Staton entered final judgment for Los Angeles regarding the notice and access claim on March 20, 2020. Judge Staton converted the September 2018 preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from enforcing the notice and access conditions. In addition, the Court entered partial summary judgment in favor of the defendants on the COPS claims and dismissed these claims with prejudice.

The defendants appealed the final judgment in favor of Los Angeles on the notice and access claims in May 2020, docket 20-55545. The parties then began mediation, and the Ninth Circuit stayed the appeal pending mediation.

This case is ongoing.","

""City of Los Angeles v. Barr"" is a landmark case that has sparked a larger debate over the interpretation of provisions in the United States Code related to the issuance of grants for criminal justice programs. The case was filed in 2017 by the City of Los Angeles, represented by its mayor Eric Garcetti, against the Department of Justice (DOJ), led by Attorney General William Barr. The dispute centered around the DOJ's imposition of special conditions on grant recipients for the Byrne Justice Assistance Grant (JAG) Program. The plaintiffs argued that the DOJ's interpretation of the statute gave them unprecedented power to withhold funds and impose conditions on all grantees, which went against the purpose and structure of the program. They sought a ruling that the DOJ's actions were beyond their legal authority. The defendants, in turn, argued that their actions were in line with the express purpose of promoting community-oriented policing and that they had the discretion to impose these conditions. The attorneys involved were representatives from the City of Los Angeles and the DOJ, and the case was heard by a panel of three circuit judges. After a series of court proceedings, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the district court's decision, ruling in favor of the City of Los Angeles. The court determined that the DOJ",0.7956,0.1227,0.2126,0.375,0.0576,0.0999,0.4489,0.0692,0.12
CJ-OH-0002,"On December 31, 2003, Lewis Williams and John Roe, who were both death-sentenced inmates of the Mansfield Correctional Institution in Mansfield, Ohio filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Ohio.  Williams and Roe asked the Court to stay their executions and issue an injunction against the defendants' use of their current lethal injection protocol, which they alleged would violate their Constitutional rights by torturing them to death.  Specifically, they feared that the short-acting anesthetic used by the defendants would wear off too soon, allowing them to feel the excrutiatingly painful effects of the potassium chloride that was used during the lethal injection process.  In addition, they argued that the defendants' use of pancuronium bromide would paralyze them, making them unable to cry out or alert their executioners that the anesthetic had worn off too soon.  

The defendants argued that the complaint was in reality a successive habeas petition, which needed to be transferred to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, and that the District Court had no jurisdiction over the claim.  On January 6, 2004, the District Court (Judge James L. Graham) construed the petition as a successive habeas petition and transferred the case to the Sixth Circuit.  

On February 3, 2004, the Sixth Circuit granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, ruling that this was a successive habeas petition, and that the plaintiffs had not met the requirements for filing a successive habeas petition.  The plaintiffs sought review by the U.S. Supreme Court, and on March 5, 2004, the U.S. Supreme Court denied the petition for writ of certiorari.  

Lewis Williams was executed by lethal injection on January 14, 2004.

John Roe was executed by lethal injection on February 3, 2004.

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the case Williams, et al. v. Taft, et al., which was a prisoner civil rights lawsuit filed on December 31, 2003. The plaintiffs, Lewis Williams Jr. and John Glenn Roe, were two death-sentenced inmates who brought a legal challenge against the State of Ohio. They alleged that the current method of execution by lethal injection violated their constitutional rights, specifically the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments. The defendants, Governor Robert Taft, Director Reginald A. Wilkinson, and Warden James Haviland, were responsible for carrying out the execution and setting the procedures for it. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief to prevent their executions, as well as reasonable attorneys fees and any other appropriate relief. They were represented by attorneys from the Ohio Public Defender's Office, while the defendants were represented by an attorney from the Ohio Attorney General. The plaintiffs' case was challenged by the Sixth Circuit's previous ruling in In re Sapp, which stated that second or successive habeas corpus petitions must be transferred to the Sixth Circuit for authorization. However, the plaintiffs argued that a recent case, Reid v. Covert, allowed for a direct appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court in civil rights cases.

Specifically, the defendant paid the charging party, a female employee, at wage rates less than it paid its male employees for completing essentially the same work.  In addition, the defendant retaliated against the charging party by terminating her when she complained of the discrimination.  After some scheduling orders, the parties settled through consent decree in December 2003.  

The two-year decree required the defendant to: expunge the charging party's personnel file from all references to the charge of discrimination, post a notice of the consent decree, provide annual EPA and Title VII training, develop and distribute  a written anti-discrimination policy, report to the EEOC at specified intervals, and pay $20,000 to the charging party.

The documents pertain to a case filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Newonics, Inc. for violating the Equal Pay Act of 1963 and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The case involves a female employee, Deborah Wayland, who was allegedly paid less than her male counterparts for the same work as an Assembly Lead. The EEOC filed a complaint and jury trial demand seeking to restrain Newonics from continuing to pay wages based on sex and to provide appropriate relief for Wayland. The jurisdiction for the case was the United States District Court for the District of Utah, and the parties involved were the plaintiff, EEOC, and the defendant, Newonics, Inc. The defendant was considered an employer under various laws and had at least 15 employees. The complaint invoked sections of the Fair Labor Standards Act, the Equal Pay Act, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, and the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The EEOC alleged that Newonics had engaged in unlawful employment practices at its West Valley City location, discriminating against Wayland because of her sex.

EE-FL-0091,"The Miami District office of the EEOC filed suit against Outback Steakhouse of Florida, Inc. on September 30, 1999 in the U.S. District Court in the Middle District of Florida.  The EEOC claimed that Outback violated Title VII and the Equal Pay Act of 1963 when it discriminated against the intervenor employee based on sex (female), paid her less money than her male counterparts, transferred her based on retaliation, attempted to force her to sign an illegal release concerning her rights under Title VII, and ultimately fired her for not signing the release.  The intervenor intervened in December 1999 citing the same Title VII issues found in the EEOC's brief.  After both sides filed motions for summary judgment, which were denied, the case went to trial on September 10, 2001.  Eight days later, the jury returned a verdict for the plaintiff, awarding the plaintiff $27,108.28 in earnings, $36,894.61 in back pay, $50,000 for pain and suffering, and $2,100,000.00 in punitive damages.  However, since punitive damages are capped by 42 U.S.C. s 1981a(b)(3)(D), the total award amounted to $364,002.89.  This award was decreased to $346,369.43 after the court granted the defendant's motion to amend the judgment.  The court also granted the intervenor $90,501.38 in fees.

Outback appealed a number of post-trial motions for a new trial, judgment as a matter of law, and others.  The EEOC cross-appealed and motioned to dismiss the appeal for lack of jurisdiction, which the appellate court granted.  The district court then sent the two parties to post-judgment mediation for injunctive relief and the issues raised in the appellate court.  Ultimately, the court entered a post-judgment consent decree, awarding equitable relief. The defendant was required to conduct training twice a year; submit reports of complaints to the EEOC; post notice of equal employment rights; and refrain from discrimination and retaliation.

The plaintiffs alleged that in the absence of these services, they were unlawfully denied their personal liberty, freedom of association, and meaningful access to community life.

On September 26, 2007, the court certified the class.

On May 30, 2008, the parties entered a court-approved settlement agreement. Under the settlement, Massachusetts agreed that within six months of the effective date of the settlement it would issue a proposal to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to establish a Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services (HCBS) (§1915(c) of the Social Security Act) waiver program that would enable individuals with traumatic brain injuries the option of a community-placed living situation. Initially this program would offer 300 such waivers.  Individuals receiving the waivers would participate in developing their own Individualized Service Plan with an interdisciplinary team and would receive services appropriate to their level of need. Waiver recipients would have the option of living with family, where applicable, or of living in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, e.g., their own apartment or home, or in a group home.

Massachusetts reserved the right to deny waivers to any person whose annual costs of care to Medicaid from residential habilitation and other waiver services, plus Title XIX state plan services, would exceed $164,131, and also to deny waivers to any person whose annual Medicaid waiver costs, exclusive of Title XIX and residential costs, would likely exceed $87,919.  The settlement limited the total cost of the waiver program, inclusive of all Medicaid and state-funded expenditures for the participants, to $15,000,000. In order to stay within this cap, the state reserved the right to take corrective actions, such as reducing the number of waivers available. Massachusetts also agreed to implement an education and outreach program in order to educate individuals with acquired traumatic brain injuries about the program.

On June 2, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking reasonable attorneys' fees and costs under the fee shifting provisions of the ADA, which allow a ""prevailing party"" plaintiff to recover expenses from a defendant. 42 U.S.C. § 12205. Massachusetts objected, arguing that the court-approved class action settlement, which expressly was not a court-ordered consent decree, was insufficient to establish the plaintiffs as the prevailing party. The court granted the plaintiffs' motion, ordering the State to pay $750,000 in attorneys' fees. 683 F. Supp. 2d 121. Massachusetts appealed. On February 17, 2011, the First Circuit Court of Appeals (Selya, J.) affirmed the lower court’s decision. 636 F.3d 1. 

On June 19, 2013, the parties agreed to a new settlement agreement that would replace the original agreement, which the state was unable to fully implement because it could not secure federal grant funding for community-based services, leaving thousands of individuals with brain injuries languishing in facilities across the state.  Under the Amended Agreement, the state would use another federal grant project, the Money Follows the Person (MFP) Demonstration, as well as other waiver programs, to provide residential and non-residential supports for up to 1,174 Medicaid-eligible people with brain injuries who were in long-term rehabilitation facilities and nursing homes.  

On July 11, 2013, the district court (Judge Michael A. Ponsor) issued final approval of the amended settlement agreement. The court retained jurisdiction over the case. The agreement was to last for six years.  

On June 27, 2014, Judge Ponsor revised a Protective Order originally granted on August 27, 2007, adjusting and broadening the scope of protected health information (PHI) for class members and their guardians.

No substantive docket entries were made during the remainder of the six-year term, which ended on July 1, 2019, so the case is presumably now closed. ","

This document, titled ""Stavros Center for Independent Living v. Patrick,"" is a class action lawsuit brought by individuals with acquired brain injuries and advocacy organizations against Governor Deval L. Patrick and other state officials. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants have violated federal laws and regulations by not providing necessary services and support for individuals with brain injuries, resulting in unnecessary institutionalization. The plaintiffs seek relief through a settlement agreement, which was approved by the court in 2008. However, a final decision on the settlement had yet to be made. Following a motion to bifurcate attorneys' fee proceedings, the court granted the plaintiffs' request for attorney fees and costs. The case was heard by Judge Michael A. Ponsor, with attorneys representing both parties, including John Stephan and Theresa Pelegano for the defendants, and Steven J. Schwartz and Alice Moran for the plaintiffs. The court ultimately ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering the defendants to provide appropriate community-based support services for individuals with brain injuries.

EE-WA-0086,"In May 2001, the Seattle District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide, Inc., d/b/a W Seattle Hotel, in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington.  The defendant allegedly subjected the charging parties and other similarly situated individuals to a sexually hostile work environment consisting of both verbal and physical abuse.  In addition, the defendant retaliated against several employees by further harassing them, resulting in the constructive discharge of some of them.  

In October 2001, five of the charging parties intervened in the suit.  In March 2002, the defendant made offers of judgment to some of the intervening parties.  Two of the charging parties accepted the offers, and the court entered a judgment against the defendant in their favor for a total of $200,000 in early April.  Later that month, the EEOC and the defendant settled their claims through a consent decree.  The remaining parties seemed to have settled with the defendant at a later date, voluntarily dismissing their claims in late May 2002.

The two-year consent decree between the EEOC and the defendant contained non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses and required the defendant to: obtain a sexual harassment consultant to conduct an audit of its sexual harassment policies and procedures, expunge the charging parties' personnel files of all references to the charges of discrimination, provide the charging parties with neutral employment references, develop a complaint procedure, provide annual Title VII training for all employees, report to the EEOC every six months, and pay $100,000 to be divided among three class members.

This document collection pertains to a legal case filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide Inc. in 2001. The EEOC, represented by attorneys A. Luis Lucero Jr., Kathryn Olson, Carmen Flores, and Gwendolyn Young Reams, alleged that the defendant engaged in discriminatory employment practices based on sex and retaliation. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington, Seattle, with Judge Thomas S. Zilly presiding over the case. The complaint and jury demand were filed on May 16, 2001, on behalf of five plaintiffs, Brandi McGuire, Clare McFadden, Rachel Beals, Katie Barker, and Steven Sloan, who were all employed by the defendant. The plaintiffs alleged that they were subjected to sexual harassment, discrimination, and retaliation by male managers and investors, including the display and sale of pornographic material in the workplace. They also claimed that their complaints were not addressed by management, leading to a hostile work environment and constructive discharge. Seeking justice, the plaintiffs requested a jury trial and monetary compensation for lost wages, emotional distress, and other related losses, as well as the implementation of policies to prevent future discrimination",0.4462,0.3258,0.3766,0.1443,0.1053,0.1217,0.241,0.176,0.2035
FH-DC-0009,"On November 24, 1999, Plaintiffs first filed this lawsuit against the U.S. Department of Agriculture (""USDA"") in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.  Plaintiffs, Native American farmers who alleged they were victims of discriminatory lending practices by the USDA, brought suit under the Declaratory Judgment Act, 28 U.S.C. §2201, and the Equal Credit Opportunity Act, 15, U.S.C. §1691.  Specifically, Plaintiffs claimed that the USDA's Farm Service Agency (""FSA"") had failed to respond to investigation reports submitted by the Civil Rights Action Team and the Office of the Inspector General, which found widespread discriminatory lending practices against Native American farmers.  According to the reports, the FSA utilized subjective interpretations of loan approval guidelines improperly to the detriment of Native American farmers, failed to advise Native Americans of the availability of USDA loan and loan servicing opportunities, and systematically erected barriers that prevented Native Americans from receiving loans or loan servicing.  Plaintiffs claimed that the USDA failed to supervise in response to these reports, and failed to investigate the civil rights complaints that its office received in response to those discriminatory practices.  The ""Omnibus Consolidated Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 1999,"" 7 U.S.C. §2279, waived the statute of limitations for these civil rights claims, normally barred after two years.  Plaintiff sought (1) declaratory judgment that the USDA had violated their rights to equal credit, participation in loan programs, and full and timely enforcement of discrimination complaints, and (2) monetary compensation and injunctive relief from the discriminatory practices outlined above.

On July 22, 2000, the U.S. moved for judgment on the pleadings, or in the alternative, summary judgment.  Plaintiffs moved on October 11, 2000 for a preliminary injunction.  However, District Court Judge Emmitt G. Sullivan denied both motions on June 18, 2001.

On November 28, 2001, Judge Sullivan granted certification of the class.  2001 WL 34676944.  This class was described as ""[a]ll Native American farmers and ranchers who (1) framed or ranched between January 1, 1981, and November 24, 1999, (2) applied to the USDA for participation in a farm program during that time period, and (3) filed a discrimination complaint with the USDA individually or through a representative during the time period.""  The U.S. filed an interlocutory appeal of the class certification with the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, and asked the District Court to stay the case pending the appeal on December 18, 2002.  Judge Sullivan denied the motion to stay on December 28, 2001.  The interlocutory appeal was denied by the Court of Appeals on October 29, 2002 (Judge David S. Tatel).  309 F.3d 789.

On December 5, 2003, Judge Sullivan granted a motion by class-member Phil Givens to opt out of the class.  In response, the Plaintiff class sought reversal by the Court of Appeals, petitioning the Court of Appeals for a writ of mandamus on February 9, 2004, but the petition was denied in a per curiam opinion on March 3, 2004.

On March 23, 2006, Judge Sullivan entered an order granting the motions by multiple involuntary members to opt out of the class and pursue individual relief.  236 F.R.D. 1.  Plaintiffs submitted their eighth amended (and final) complaint on February 11, 2008.

On December 19, 2010, the parties notified the court that they had reached a settlement, and on December 22, Plaintiffs moved for preliminary approval of the settlement and settlement agreement class certification.  Judge Sullivan granted the preliminary approval on November 1, 2010, and granted final approval of the settlement agreement on April 28, 2011.  On April 29, 2011, Judge Sullivan entered an order of final judgment, dismissing this action with prejudice.  This began the 180-day period of the settlement agreement claims process, ending on October 26, 2011.

The settlement agreement created a total compensation fund of $680,000,000.  In exchange for Plaintiffs' agreement to dismiss the suit, Defendants agreed to suspend all collection efforts that were currently in the Service Center Information Management System or on individuals who file claims pursuant to the agreement.  In addition, all members of the class would be able to make a claim to an appointed ""claim administrator,"" who would make its best effort to make a determination on the claim within 10 days.  These claims would be in one of two tracks: ""Track A"" required ""substantial evidence"" of discrimination, and awarded a liquidated damage amount of $50,000.  ""Track B"" claims required more--a preponderance of the evidence of discrimination--and could pay an award up to $250,000.  If any claimant was also making a claim in response to the <a href=http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12515><i>Pigford v. Glickman</i></a> or <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12757""><i>Garcia v. Vilsack</i></a> settlements, that individual was not eligible for a claim award in this settlement.  The deadline for claims under the settlement agreement was set at 180 days after final approval of settlement agreement.  Pursuant to a cy pres provision, any leftover or unclaimed funds were to be distributed to non-profit organizations serving Native American farmers and ranchers. Additional provisions of the settlement included: the USDA agreed to create a Council for Native American Farming and Ranching (responsible for transmitting recommendations concerning changes to FSA regulations or internal guidance that would eliminate barriers to program participation by Native Americans), create an ombudsperson for Native Americans and other socially disadvantaged farmers and ranchers, and commence a review of their policies and training materials, promising to make all necessary revisions to prevent further discriminatory behavior.

On August 30, 2013, the Plaintiffs filed a status report notifying the court that the claims process had concluded, but that approximately $380,000,000 remained available for cy pres distribution. On September 24, 2014, the Plaintiffs filed a motion to modify the settlement’s cy pres provision: while the cy pres funds would still go to non-profit organizations serving Native American farmers and ranchers, the plaintiffs proposed changes in the mechanism for distributing funds. However, on May 19, 2015, Marilyn and George Keepseagle (“the Keepseagles”), lead named plaintiffs and class representatives, opposed class counsel’s proposed modification, retained their own counsel, and filed their own motion to modify the settlement agreement, proposing that the court order a pro rata distribution of the remaining settlement funds to successful claimants. On July 24, 2015, Judge Sullivan denied both motions to modify the settlement agreement, concluding that there was no basis to approve the modifications under the law governing the disposition of unclaimed settlements nor under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 60(b)(5) or 60(b)(6). 2015 WL 4510837.

On December 14, 2015, all the plaintiffs, including the Keepseagles, filed an unopposed motion to modify the settlement agreement’s cy pres provision. The proposed modification was a compromise between class counsel’s and the Keepseagles’ prior proposals and provided for (1) a supplemental award of $18,500 to each claimant who prevailed in the original claims process, and (2) an amended process through which $38,000,000 of cy pres funds were to be distributed. On April 20, 2016, Judge Sullivan approved the modification. 2016 WL 9455764.

In June 2016, two class members appealed Judge Sullivan’s approval to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, contending that all of the remaining funds should have been distributed pro rata to the successful claimants and that the cy pres provision was unconstitutional. On May 16, 2017, the Court of Appeals (Judges Brown, Wilkins, and Edwards) affirmed the district court in finding that the modification was “fair, reasonable, and adequate”; the Court declined to reach the merits of the appellants’ legal challenges to the cy pres provision, finding that they had explicitly waived those claims before the district court and forfeited them because they had never raised any legal challenges to the cy pres provision previously despite multiple clear opportunities to do so. 2017 WL 2111020. The Supreme Court then declined to hear the case on March 26, 2018, finally permitting the modification to the agreement to be implemented.  ","

This document, titled Keepseagle, et al v. Veneman, et al, is a compilation of individual summaries from various segments of a larger legal case involving Native American farmers and ranchers. The plaintiffs, represented by a team of attorneys including Sam Hirsch, Katherine Amy Fallow, Jessica Ring Amunson, and Joseph M. Sellers, allege that the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and its Secretary, Thomas J. Vilsack, engaged in systemic discrimination against them in the provision of farm loans and other government programs. The plaintiffs claim that they were unfairly denied loans and other benefits based on their race, leading to financial losses and hindering their ability to compete in the agricultural industry. The case, which was filed in 1999 and terminated in 2011, involved numerous court proceedings including hearings, motions, and conferences, with various attorneys being involved at different stages. The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of monetary damages and changes to the USDA's policies and practices to prevent future discrimination. Ultimately, the court found in favor of the plaintiffs and awarded them monetary compensation and injunctive relief to ensure fair treatment by the USDA in the future.

EE-AR-0063,"On November 4, 1998 plaintiffs, a group of eight black employees and one Asian employee of a Sears store in Little Rock, Arkansas, filed suit against Sears, Roebuck and Co. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas alleging that the defendant had unlawfully discriminated against them on the basis of race in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981, Title VII (42 U.S.C. § 2000e), and state law.  The complaint stemmed from an allegation of unequal pay but included other related allegations.  Specifically the employees alleged disparate treatment and disparate impact in terms of pay, training, placement, transfer, and promotion.  They sought a declaratory judgment, a permanent injunction, damages, and costs and fees.

On July 3, 2000 the district court (Judge Susan Webber Wright) denied the defendant's motion for summary judgment on the individual claims of each plaintiff and granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification as modified by the court.  The class was comprised of current and former non-white hourly employees of the Sears store in question from November 4, 1995 for the disparate treatment claims and from November 4, 1997 for the disparate impact claims.

The parties thereafter pursued settlement negotiations and on May 17, 2001 the court (Judge Wright) granted preliminary approval to their agreement.  The settlement provided for injunctive relief and damages.  The defendant agreed to hold a job fair for all class members, modify its hiring and promotion procedures, modify its evaluation and employee recordkeeping protocols, and monitor its compliance with the settlement and report to the court and class counsel.  Class members were awarded a total of $1,142,000.00 and defendant agreed to pay attorney's fees of costs of $417,717.00.  The case terminated on August 17, 2001 when the court (Judge Wright) granted final approval to the settlement agreement.

This document, titled ""Class Action Lawsuit Against Sears for Discrimination Against Minority Employees at University Store"" discusses a lawsuit filed by several plaintiffs against Sears, alleging discrimination against non-White hourly employees at their University Store. The lead plaintiff, Tamera L. Williams, represented herself and others in a similar situation, while the defendant, Sears Roebuck & Company, was represented by multiple attorneys from the law firm Winston & Strawn in Chicago. The plaintiffs, including Robinson, Droughn, Harris, and others, claimed that they and other minority employees were subjected to discriminatory practices, including unequal pay, disparate treatment in job assignments and promotions, and subjective evaluations used to deny promotions and higher paying positions. The plaintiffs sought to certify a class of 932 current and former minority employees and have met the requirements for certification under Rule 23(a). The defendant, Sears, denied these allegations and argued that the plaintiffs were not adequate representatives of the class.

The case was filed in 1998, invoking the jurisdiction of the court under federal civil rights laws. The plaintiffs sought compensatory and punitive damages, as well as a declaration that Sears had violated federal and state civil rights laws. They also requested a permanent injunction against Sears from engaging in discriminatory practices. The parties engaged in",0.5263,0.3571,0.4255,0.1202,0.0814,0.0971,0.2201,0.1494,0.1779
IM-DC-0090,"This case involves a dispute about visa processing. Following a March 20, 2020 decision by the State Department to cease most visa services, President Trump issued Presidential Proclamation 10014 on April 20, suspending the entry of all immigrants into the U.S. for two months, unless they qualified for an exception. Two months later, the entry suspension was extended to December 31, 2020 and expanded to include temporary nonimmigrant visas in Proclamation 10052. As a result, the State Department suspended review and adjudication of visas for non-excepted applicants (the No-Visa Policy). 

Many groups were affected, including diversity lottery (DV-2020) winners who had not yet been issued a visa and who would not have their eligibility carry over into the next year, and minors who would age out of the preferential treatment for which they were eligible. 

On May 28, 2020, U.S. citizens and lawful permanent residents who had sponsored noncitizen minor children or other relatives for immigrant visas filed this class action lawsuit against President Trump, the State Department, and the Department of Homeland Security in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, with Judge Amit P. Mehta presiding. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary and permanent injunction preventing the government from acting to “deny or refuse consideration” of their visa petitions, a declaration that the Proclamations were unlawful, and attorney’s fees. They sued under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) (5 U.S.C. § 706) and the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. §§ 1182, 1185) and alleged that the defendants’ conduct exceeded their authority and violated the plaintiffs’ rights under the Due Process Clause. 

The plaintiffs moved to certify a class of visa sponsors whose beneficiaries or derivative beneficiaries were subject to the Proclamations and at risk of aging out on June 2. 

On June 23, Judge Mehta denied the plaintiffs' motions for a preliminary injunction and class certification because they failed to show that a justiciable case or controversy existed. Specifically, Judge Mehta found that the plaintiffs had not shown that they faced imminent injury because some of the plaintiffs’ minor beneficiaries had successfully applied for visas under the “national interest exception” (a separate administrative procedure), and others had been unable to apply for visas for reasons unrelated to the Proclamations. 2020 WL 3429786. 

The plaintiffs then amended their complaint on July 17, 2020, adding as plaintiffs corporations that were unable to hire necessary workers because workers’ visas had not been issued along with diversity visa selectees whose visas had to issue by September 30 to remain eligible for entry. They also proposed the following four subclasses: 

1.	Those who will be unable to receive their diversity visas before Sept. 30 deadline, and will thus be unable to immigrate. 

2.	Citizens who have sponsored an immediate relative who now cannot immigrate. 

3.	Lawful permanent residents who have an “approved immigrant visa petition for a preference relative” who, because of the Proclamations, will be unable to immigrate.

4.	 U.S. employers whose employees or potential employees cannot now immigrate.

Several states and the District of Columbia also filed an amicus brief arguing that immigrants were good for their economies and that the presidential action would hurt their recovery.

Three other suits filed between July 10, 2020 and August 5, 2020 were fully consolidated with this case on August 13: <i>Aker v. Trump</i>, No. 20-cv-1926; <i>Mohammed v. Pompeo</i>, No. 20-cv-1856; and <i>Fonjong v. Trump</i>, No. 20-cv-2128. In all of these cases, the plaintiffs were diversity visa selectees and derivative beneficiaries challenging Presidential Proclamations 10014 and 10052 under the APA; two (<i>Mohammed</i> and <i>Fonjong</i>) were filed by the same law firm. 

Judge Mehta also partially consolidated <i>Panda v. Wolf</i>, No. 20-cv-1907, with this case to the extent that <i>Panda</i> raised similar issues. <i>Panda</i> involved an APA challenge to Proclamation 10052 but also included an equal protection argument that the government's conduct disparately impacted Indian nationals. On September 16, Judge Mehta denied the <i>Panda</i> plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction in the part of that case continuing separately. 2020 WL 5545554. The <i>Panda</i> plaintiffs appealed, and on September 29, <i>Panda</i> was stayed pending the outcome of the appeal.

Following the consolidation, many influential companies filed an amicus brief as well, arguing that they would suffer serious economic harm from the proclamations. The companies included Adobe, Amazon, Apple, Google, Microsoft, Paypal, Reddit, Twitter, Uber Technologies, and Zillow. 

The plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint on August 23, 2020, adding a claim under the Mandamus Act (28 U.S.C. § 1361) and requesting that the court issue an order of mandamus requiring defendants to adjudicate visa petitions. 

On September 4, 2020, Judge Mehta granted the DV-2020 plaintiffs a preliminary injunction. The defendants were ordered to “undertake good-faith efforts . . . to expeditiously process and adjudicate DV-2020 diversity visas.” Defendants were preliminarily enjoined “from interpreting and applying the COVID Guidance to DV-2020 selectees” in such a way as not to process their visas because they were not “mission critical.” The remaining motions and requests were not granted. The court also delayed certifying a class, and the non DV-2020 plaintiffs did not obtain injunctive relief because vacatur of the policy would not eliminate their family separation problem. 2020 WL 5367010.

On September 14, 2020, the court amended the preliminary injunction to prevent the State Department from waiting 14 days to issue visas to DV-2020 applicants who were inside certain COVID-affected regions because the delay served no rational purpose. 2020 WL 5886855. On September 24, 2020, non DV-2020 plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit over the ruling against their motion for a preliminary injunction. 

On September 30, 2020, the court certified a class in <i>Gomez</i> consisting of all “Individuals who have been selected to receive an immigrant visa through the U.S. Department of State’s FY2020 Diversity Visa Lottery and who had not received their immigrant visa on or before April 23, 2020, when the Presidential Proclamation 10014, later extended by Presidential Proclamation 10052, took effect.” But the court declined to certify a class in <i>Aker</i> because it was unclear how many applicants who were issued visas before the Proclamation had not been able to have them renewed, and because there was no legal impediment to renewing a visa. It also ordered the State Department to reserve 9,095 visas (calculated based on the expected reduction due to COVID-19) to correct for the loss of visas due to the illegal processing delays. 2020 WL 5861101. 

This case is ongoing.

PN-AZ-0002,"On September 2, 2010, the United States Department of Justice (""DOJ""), Civil Rights Division, filed this lawsuit under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 in the United States Court for the District of Arizona, Phoenix Division. The DOJ sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that Maricopa County had violated the Civil Rights Act by failing to comply with a DOJ investigation. Specifically, the DOJ claimed that Maricopa County had refused to comply after a year of being minimally cooperative and obstructing the DOJ investigation into the police practices in Maricopa County.

Maricopa County receives federal funds for its Sheriff's Office. Under an implementing regulation, offices that receive financial assistance agree to give the DOJ access to their records and they make contractual agreements to that effect.  The DOJ was investigating a violation of the Omnibus Crime Control Act and the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act, and had requested documents from the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO). The DOJ made 51 specific requests. After over a year had passed, the MCSO had only partially complied with 3 of these 51 requests. The DOJ found them to be in violation of Title VI and initiated this lawsuit.

On June 2, 2011, after the parties had both filed motions for summary judgment, a settlement agreement was reached. The agreement granted the DOJ access to the MCSO facilities. Additionally, the MCSO agreed to produce the documents that the DOJ had requested, as well as a blanket agreement to comply with Title VI. On August 1, 2011, the Court (Judge Murray G. Snow) dismissed the case 60 days after a Joint Motion to Remove Case to the Inactive Docket was made.

There is no further activity and this case appears to be closed.

On May 10, 2012, presumably as a result of the continued investigation, the United States filed a lawsuit against Maricopa County in a related case, United States v. Maricopa County, et. Al, docket #2:12-cv-00981-LOA, (Clearinghouse Code: <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12017"">PN-AZ-0001</a>).","

The document in question is a comprehensive summary of the case ""United States v. Maricopa County,"" which was initiated by the United States Department of Justice against Maricopa County, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO), and Sheriff Joseph M. Arpaio. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants engaged in a pattern or practice of discriminatory and unconstitutional conduct against Latinos in law enforcement activities. The plaintiffs, represented by the Assistant Attorney General of the Civil Rights Division and the United States Attorney, filed the complaint in June 2011, in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The case number is 2:10-cv-01878-PHX-GMS. The complaint outlines various violations, including discriminatory policing practices and jail practices, and seeks a court order to remedy these violations and prevent future discrimination. The court proceedings included motions for removal and stay, which were granted, and the case was placed on the inactive docket for 60 days. The agreement between the parties resulted in the case being placed on the inactive docket, with provisions for compliance, enforcement, and the appointment of a monitor to ensure that MCSO follows Title VI mandates.

NS-CA-0016,"On April 7, 2015, Human Rights Watch (HRW), a non-partisan, non-profit human rights organization, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California. The plaintiff sued under the Administrative Procedures Act against the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The plaintiff, represented by the Electronic Frontier Foundation, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief claiming that a mass surveillance program conducted by the DEA violated the HRW and its staff's First Amendment free speech and free association rights as well as their Fourth Amendment right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures.

Specifically, HRW alleged that the DEA had been engaged in a secret mass surveillance program as early as the 1990s. HRW noted that the DEA acknowledged the existence of this program in a declaration filed in January 2015 for a separate case (included as an exhibit in HRW's complaint). According to HRW, the surveillance program indiscriminately swept in call records for calls between the United States and ""Designated Countries"" that are ""determined to have a 'demonstrated nexus to international drug trafficking and related criminal activities.' "" HRW alleged that these call records were recorded in databases, which were then made accessible to the officers and employees of the DEA, DHS, and FBI. HRW claimed that during the course of its work, it communicated with individuals in Designated Countries, and that the surveillance program put HRW's contacts at risk and burdened HRW's human rights advocacy efforts. HRW alleged that the defendants violated its First Amendment and Fourth Amendment rights, and requested declaratory and injunctive relief and reasonable attorneys' fees.

On June 15, 2015, the defendants, represented by an attorney from the Department of Justice, moved to dismiss the case for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, arguing that HRW failed to establish that it has standing to pursue its claims. On August 14, 2015, Judge Philip S. Gutierrez issued an order holding in abeyance ruling on the defendants' motion. Judge Gutierrez determined that HRW should be allowed an opportunity to conduct discovery to respond to the defendants' attack on standing, and authorized HRW to serve a limited number of interrogatories on the defendants.

On December 14, 2015, HRW filed for voluntary dismissal without prejudice, as the defendants had provided additional information through discovery concerning the destruction of call records collected in bulk. Two days later, Judge Gutierrez submitted an order dismissing the case without prejudice.   ","

This case, titled Human Rights Watch v. Drug Enforcement Administration et al., is a civil lawsuit filed by the international human rights organization, Human Rights Watch (HRW), against the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other government agencies. HRW alleges that the defendants have violated their First and Fourth Amendment rights through a mass surveillance program that collects and retains call records and other information from designated foreign countries. According to HRW, this program hinders their ability to effectively communicate and advocate for human rights, as the collected information includes their communications with individuals and organizations in these designated countries.

The case was initially filed in 2015, and updated in 2018. The plaintiff, HRW, is represented by attorneys Elizabeth A. Brandenburg, Kenneth Herbert Schellin, and V. Bruce J. Einhorn. The defendants include the DEA, James Comey, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Justice, represented by attorneys Kathryn L Wyer and Loretta Lynch.

HRW sought injunctive and declaratory relief, asking the court to declare the program unconstitutional and to prevent future use and dissemination of their call records obtained through the program.

The complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated against employees in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.  More specifically, the complaint alleged the defendant terminated the employment of four employees based on their ages.  The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment which was denied in January 2005.  This case consolidated with a suit brought on behalf of the complainants by a private attorney (2:05-cv-00714-WMA).

The document in question is a docket report for case number 2:05-cv-00733-WMA in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Alabama. It was accessed on April 4, 2007 at 14:38:48 by a PACER user with the login hs0328, under the client code nniles. This case, titled Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc., involves a dispute between the plaintiffs and the defendant, with the plaintiffs seeking relief for alleged age discrimination in employment by the defendant.

The plaintiffs, Mildred Byrd, Ermea J. Russell, L.B. Garrison, Sharon Tittle, Robbie Scogin, and Beverly McCluskey, are former employees of Wal-Mart Store 409 in Haleyville, Alabama. They are represented by a team of attorneys, including lead counsel John Smith and co-counsel Sarah Jones. The plaintiffs allege that the defendant, a large corporation in the manufacturing industry, has engaged in unfair business practices that have caused harm to their clients. Specifically, they claim that in December 2002, Wal-Mart terminated four employees, all over the age of 49, from their employment in the receiving department due to their age.

PN-WI-0001,"Plaintiffs, ACLU national and the ACLU of Wisconsin, along with Covington & Burling attorneys, filed this class action alleging that the Milwaukee Police Department's (MPD) stop-and-frisk policies were unconstitutional. The case was filed in the Eastern District of Wisconsin on February 22, 2017. The complaint alleged under Section 1983 that Milwaukee's stop-and-frisk policies violated the Fourth Amendment's search and seizure protections as well as the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause. It also alleged under Section 2000d that Milwaukee was in violation of Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorney's fees and costs. 

This case was brought as a class action on behalf of all persons who had been or would have been stopped by MPD officers after January 7th, 2008. More broadly, the complaint alleged that in 2008, when Milwaukee adopted a ""broken windows"" policy regarding crime prevention, MPD began engaging in high-volume, suspicion-less stops as well as stops illegally motivated by race and ethnicity. The complaint alleges a formal and informal quota system of stops that led to a threefold increase in stops from 2007 to 2015. Plaintiffs also defined a subclass of black and Latino individuals. All of the named plaintiffs in the class were black or Latino, and the complaint detailed specific allegations of suspicion-less stops for each of them as well as data indicating the impact that Milwaukee's stop-and-frisk policy had specifically on black and Latino communities.   

The parties were engaged in negotiations almost from the beginning - a Joint Interim Settlement Report was filed in September 2017, and minute orders show that the parties were engaged in mediation and later settlement negotiations throughout the fall of 2017 and into the spring and summer of 2018. A settlement was approved on July 23, 2018. The settlement covers a range of issues: changes to officer training; revisions to MPD policies and guidelines regarding reasonable suspicion and probable cause; body camera usage; data collection, coding, and publication; timely filing of reports after stops; supervision from within MPD for officers conducting stops; procedures for both external and internal complaints regarding stop-and-frisk; data auditing by MPD; hiring, counseling, retraining, and discipline; and community engagement. 

The District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin retained jurisdiction to enforce the agreement under Judge J. P. Stadtmueller. To achieve compliance with the agreement, MPD must incorporate all substantive parts of the agreement into policy, hire and train needed personnel, appropriate sufficient funds, and show sustained and continuing improvement on constitutional policing based on a variety of data-based factors. The settlement terminates after five years. The ACLU and an outside consultant (CJI) will act as monitors. The settlement indicates $1,900,000 in attorney's fees and costs, and Milwaukee is also responsible for paying for CJI's fees. 

<b>Current status</b>
MPD is required to provide data on variety of police and civilian interactions quarterly, and to make training and policy materials available for review. CJI is to file a report each year regarding MPD's compliance and their review of relevant data. If MPD is non-compliant, CJI can submit six-month updates on those issues, indicating whether they have been fixed. The case is ongoing: CJI filed an initial report in September of 2019, a six-month report indicating items on which MPD is non-compliant in April of 2020, and a second semi-annual report on Jun 5, 2020.

This collection of documents, which includes court filings and updates, pertains to a civil case, Charles Collins, et al. v. City of Milwaukee, et al., filed in the United States District Court Eastern District of Wisconsin. The plaintiffs, including Charles Collins, Tracy Adams, and D.A., alleged that the Milwaukee Police Department (MPD) engaged in discriminatory practices during traffic stops, field interviews, and frisks. These practices, motivated by race and ethnicity, violated the plaintiffs' Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, as well as Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a court-ordered settlement agreement that outlined specific requirements for the MPD, including the documentation of police encounters and the implementation of training and audit procedures. The defendants, represented by the City Attorney's Office, denied the allegations and argued that they had not violated any constitutional or statutory rights. The court proceedings involved multiple filings, updates on the progress of compliance with the settlement agreement, and challenges faced by the defendants in meeting the requirements. The court also received evidence and reports from a consultant hired to monitor and assess compliance with the agreement. The final verdict has not yet been reached, as the defendants are still working towards full compliance with the settlement agreement.",0.6432,0.2334,0.3425,0.2075,0.0751,0.1103,0.338,0.1227,0.18
CJ-FL-0009,"In the fall of 2018, Florida voters amended the Florida Constitution, restoring voting rights to most people convicted of felonies “upon completion of all terms of sentence, including parole or probation.”  (This excluded people convicted of murder or sexual offenses.)  On June 28, 2019, Governor Ron DeSantis signed Senate Bill 7066 into law, defining “all terms of sentence” to include payment of all conviction-related restitution, fines, fees, and costs (“legal financial obligations”).  People who could not determine the amount of their obligations, or who could not afford to pay them, were effectively disenfranchised.

In June and July 2019, five lawsuits were filed challenging SB7066: 
<ul> <li>June 15, <i>Mendez v. DeSantis</i></li> <li>June 28, <i>Jones v. DeSantis</i></li> <li>June 28, <i>Raysor v. Lee</i></li> <li>June 28, <i>Gruver v. Barton</i></li> <li>July 1, <i>  McCoy v. DeSantis</i></li> </ul> All five suits, filed in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Florida, were assigned to Chief Judge Mark Walker.  Consolidated on June 30, 2019 for purposes of case management, they were ultimately tried together as a single consolidated case.  Chief Judge Walker recused himself on July 17, 2019, because his wife’s law firm had been retained to represent one of the defendants.  The consolidated case was reassigned to Judge Robert L. Hinkle.

The plaintiffs were 19 individuals, the League of Women Voters of Florida, the NAACP Florida State Conference, and the Orange County Branch of the NAACP.  Each group of plaintiffs advanced different legal theories and named different defendants.  Combined, the consolidated suit named as defendants Governor DeSantis, his Secretary of State, and the Supervisor of Elections for each county where an individual plaintiff resided.  The consolidated suit alleged that SB7066 violated the Ex Post Facto Clause of the United States Constitution; the First, Eighth, Fourteenth, and Twenty-Fourth Amendments; the National Voter Registration Act; and the Florida Constitution.  The plaintiffs, represented by the Brennan Center for Justice, the Campaign Legal Center, the Southern Poverty Law Center, the ACLU, the ACLU of Florida, the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, and private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief restoring their voting rights.

In their amended complaint of July 16, 2019, the <i>Raysor</i> plaintiffs sought class certification (which was eventually granted on April 7, 2020).  The proposed class included “all persons who would be eligible to vote in Florida but for unpaid financial obligations.”  Class members asserting that they were “genuinely unable to pay” would form a subclass. 

The Governor petitioned the Florida Supreme Court on August 9, 2019 for an advisory opinion on the validity of SB7066.  The court’s <a href=""https://www.brennancenter.org/sites/default/files/2020-01/Supreme%20Court%20Opinion.pdf"">advisory opinion</a> of January 16, 2020 announced that the constitutional amendment’s language “all terms of sentence” would have been understood by Florida voters to include “all legal financial obligations imposed in conjunction with an adjudication of guilt.”  While awaiting this advisory opinion, the Governor unsuccessfully sought a stay of proceedings in the district court.

On August 15, 2019, the court denied the Supervisors of Elections’ motion to dismiss the case or to stay discovery.  The <i>Gruver</i> plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction the same day.  The injunction was granted on October 18, 2019, effective against all defendants except the Governor and the Supervisor of Elections for Orange County.  The injunction prohibited officials from taking any action to prevent the named plaintiffs from registering to vote (if they <i>asserted</i> inability to pay) or from voting (if they <i>demonstrated</i> their inability to pay).  Simultaneously, the court denied the Governor and the Secretary of State their motion to dismiss or abstain.  410 F. Supp. 3d 1284.  The Eleventh Circuit upheld on February 19, 2020.  950 F.3d 795.

The <i>Gruver</i> plaintiffs sought in late October to expand the preliminary injunction to cover four additional named plaintiffs who were seeking to vote in November municipal elections.  This motion was denied the first week of January 2020.

In the meantime, the district court partially stayed the injunction on December 19, 2019.  While still protecting the plaintiffs’ ability to <i>register</i>, the modified injunction did not guarantee their ability to <i>vote</i>.  This partial stay expired on February 11, 2020.  The Eleventh Circuit upheld the preliminary injunction on February 19, ruling that, among other things, the state’s pay-to-vote requirement should be analyzed under a standard of heightened scrutiny rather than rational basis review.  950 F.3d 795.
 
On March 30, 2020, the court denied the state defendants’ motion for summary judgment, but dismissed the plaintiffs’ abandoned Ex Post Facto and Florida Constitution claims.  The plaintiffs’ class certification motion was granted the following week, on April 7 (not in time for class members to vote in the March 2020 presidential primaries).

The trial was held from April 27–May 6 by videoconference (due to the COVID-19 pandemic). The court issued its opinion on the merits on May 24, 2020.  Ruling that the state was in violation of the Fourteenth and Twenty-Fourth Amendments and the National Voter Registration Act, the court declared Florida’s requirements unconstitutional as applied to: those who could not vote because they could not afford to pay; those who could not vote because the amount to pay was unknown and “cannot be determined with diligence”; and those who could not vote because they owed the state “fees” or “costs.”  However, a requirement to pay “fines and restitution…is not unconstitutional as applied to those who are able to pay.”  The court named each plaintiff and specifically declared his or her eligibility to vote.  It ruled that the plaintiffs in <i>McCoy</i>, <i>Raysor</i>, and <i>Gruver</i> could collect attorneys’ fees and costs (the plaintiffs in <i>Jones</i> and <i>Mendez</i> had not actively participated in the majority of the litigation).  

As to the class and the subclass, the court issued an injunction requiring the state to create and advertise a form for obtaining an individual advisory opinion on voting eligibility.  The injunction specified that if the state failed to respond to an individual submission within 21 days, the person would be automatically eligible to vote.  It further directed the state to publish requirements for voting eligibility following a felony conviction.

The court explicitly retained jurisdiction to enforce the declaration and injunction.

The state defendants appealed the ruling on June 1, 2020.  On June 14, the district court denied their motion to stay the ruling pending appeal.  On July 1, the Eleventh Circuit granted the state’s motion for initial hearing <i>en banc</i> (that is, before the entire court, rather than a panel of three judges).  Without explanation, it also granted a stay of the district court’s injunction, pending appeal.  The Supreme Court, also without explanation and over a dissent by Justices Sotomayor, Ginsburg, and Kagan, denied a request to lift the stay.

On July 15, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion in the Eleventh Circuit seeking to disqualify 3 of the court’s 12 judges from hearing the appeal.  Judges Lagoa and Luck had been justices of the Florida Supreme Court when it issued its advisory opinion in this case in August 2019; both had committed to the United States Senate that they would recuse themselves from cases in which they had previously played a role.  Judge Brasher, as the Solicitor General of Alabama, had vigorously <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15502"">defended Alabama against a similar lawsuit</a> shortly before his appointment to the federal judiciary.

Judge Brasher disqualified himself on July 21, 2020, but denied the plaintiffs’ motion to disqualify as moot: he emphasized that he was recusing because of his chambers policy, not as a result of the plaintiffs’ motion.  Judges Lagoa and Luck denied the motion to disqualify on July 27, 2020.

The Eleventh Circuit heard oral arguments on August 18, 2020. On September 11, 2020, the court issued an opinion that reversed the judgment of the district court on the grounds that the plaintiffs failed to prove Constitutional violation. 

The court held that: (1) the amendment and the statute did not violate Equal Protection Clause; (2) the amendment and the statute did not violate Twenty-Fourth Amendment; (3) felon re-enfranchisement laws were not void for vagueness; and (4) the amendment and the statute did not deny the plaintiffs' rights to procedural due process. 

Because section 2 of the Fourteenth Amendment expressly allows for felon disenfranchisment, the Supreme Court had held in <i>Richardson v. Ramirez</i> that the Equal Protection Clause does not forbid it. Applying that precedent, the court held that Florida's Amendment 4 and Senate Bill 7066 did not violate the Equal Protection Clause under rational basis review. Additionally, the court held that because court costs and fees are legitimate parts of a criminal sentence, there was no basis to regard them as a tax. As such, the laws did not disenfranchise the individuals for failure to pay a tax, but rather because they had not ""satisfied the demands of justice"" as mandated by state statute. The state's justification for these voting requirements qualified as a constitutionally legitimate interest. Therefore the statutes satisfied the requirements of the Twenty-Fourth Amendment. Lastly, the criminal processes necessary for a conviction were sufficient to justify denying individuals the right to vote. The deprivation was a consequence of a felony conviction in Florida, so the court upheld Florida's conditional restoration of the right to vote.

The appeals court reversed the judgment of the district court and vacated the challenged portions of its injunction. Additionally, the Ninth Circuit severed and lifted the stay of the cross-appeal (Case No. 20-12304). This cross-appeal had been filed on June 19, 2020 by the plaintiffs in the <i>McCoy</i> case, which has been consolidated earlier in the litigation. 

On October 21, 2020, the plaintiffs in the <i>McCoy</i> case filed an opening brief for the cross appeal on the questions of (1) whether a Nineteenth Amendment claim requires proof of discriminatory intent and (2) the appropriateness of the test applied by the lower court to the equal protection claims, given that the plaintiffs in <i>McCoy</i> are women.

The case is ongoing.","

This document, titled ""Case 4:19-cv-00300-RH-MJF (Case: 20-12003),"" is a compilation of summaries from a court case challenging Florida's statute, § 98.0751, which restricts the right to vote for individuals with past felony convictions. The plaintiffs in this case include both individuals with felony convictions seeking to regain their right to vote under Florida's Amendment 4 and civil rights organizations advocating for the rights of these individuals. The defendant in this case is the Governor of Florida, who is responsible for enforcing the state's laws. The plaintiffs allege that the statute, which requires individuals with felony convictions to pay all outstanding legal financial obligations before being allowed to register to vote, is unconstitutional. They argue that this law effectively denies the right to vote for the majority of individuals who were supposed to benefit from Amendment 4. The plaintiffs also contend that the state did not make a sufficient effort to help citizens determine how much they owe, making it difficult for them to become eligible to vote. Seeking relief, the plaintiffs are requesting a declaration that the statute is unconstitutional and an injunction to prevent its enforcement. The attorneys involved in this case represent both sides, with the plaintiffs being represented by a diverse group of lawyers including",0.8065,0.1006,0.1789,0.287,0.0357,0.0635,0.3733,0.0466,0.0828
SD-KS-0001,"This is the case in which the U.S. Supreme Court announced in 1954 that segregated schools were inherently unequal, and in 1955 required school districts to desegregate ""with all deliberate speed.""  It is the most famous civil rights case in American history.  But it also had a specific set of plaintiffs -- schoolchildren in Topeka, Kansas -- and a specific history in its own community.  This summary focuses on that history, rather than the broader setting and the Supreme Court jurisprudence.  

On February 28, 1951, a group of black parents and children residing in the Topeka, Kansas, school district filed, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Kansas, a complaint naming as defendants the district's school board and certain school administrators.  The plaintiffs were represented by local NAACP cooperating attorney Charles Bledsoe and sought class action status for their case, which they filed citing what was then 8 U.S.C. § 43, part of the Civil Rights Act of 1870.  Their complaint alleged that the defendants, acting pursuant to state statute, denied the plaintiff's equal protection rights under the Fourteenth Amendment by operating separate public schools for white and black children, denying black children the right to enroll in and attend the schools attended by similarly-situated white children.  The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants' conduct denied, solely on the basis of ""race and color,"" to the child plaintiffs educational advantages, opportunities and facilities equal to those provided to white children, and that the black children forced by state law to attend racially-segregated schools ""do not and cannot"" enjoy the educational benefits afforded to whites.  The plaintiffs alleged that some black students had to travel two miles farther to attend an all-black school than if allowed to attend the nearest all-white school.  The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees, and asked that the court convene a three judge panel, then required by 28 U.S.C. § 2281, to consider the constitutionality of the state statute. 

On March 22, 1951, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint making the same basic allegations and seeking the same relief.  It named as an intervening defendant the State of Kansas.  The amended complaint was itself amended on May 29, 1951, when plaintiffs' counsel amended a paragraph to specify that the education opportunities provided by the defendants to the plaintiff children were inferior to those provided to white children in numerous respects, including ""physical facilities, curricula, teaching, resources, student personnel services, access, and all other educational factors, tangible and intangible....""  Moreover, the amended paragraph alleged that, apart from all other factors, the racial segregation practiced by the defendants ""in and of itself"" constituted an inferiority in educational opportunity offered to blacks, when compared to that offered to whites.

The school board's June 7, 1951, answer denied the claimed violations of constitutional rights.  It also sought to correct or clarify certain claims made in the complaint, asserting that the operation of separate schools only occurred in the district's elementary-level facilities, that the city had but a single district with multiple attendance territories, that it provided free transportation for black children to any of the four black elementary schools operated for them in the district while providing no transportation for white elementary school students, and that, on average, the distances traveled to schools by black and by white children were the same.  The state's answer, filed on June 15, 1951, generally denied the plaintiffs' allegations, specifically denying that the state statute was unconstitutional (and added, as had the other defendants' answer,  that the plaintiffs' complaint had mis-cited  the state statute of which they complained, by citing one applicable to cities of the second class, whereas Topeka was a city of the first class).  The state also asserted that the complaint failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  That claim must have been rejected in an unpublished ruling, for the case was tried that summer.

After a trial of approximately ten days, on August 3, 1951, the three-judge panel sitting as the district court issued its opinion upholding the state statute and denying the plaintiffs' claims for relief.  The court briefly reviewed the issues of facilities, curricula, instruction, and travel, finding that comparable educational facilities and services were provided to students of both races.  It concluded that in the maintenance and operation of the separate schools ""there is no willful, intentional or material discrimination.""  Recognizing that prior Supreme Court precedent (including Plessy v. Ferguson, 163 U.S. 537 (1896)) allowing segregation in state-provided services seemed, to some degree, undercut by recent Supreme Court decisions, the district court adjudged that the prior cases, not having been overruled, controlled.  Brown v. Board of Education, 96 F. Supp. 797 (D. Ks. 1951) (Circuit Judge Walter August Huxman).   The plaintiffs appealed directly to the U.S. Supreme Court, as then permitted under 28 U.S.C. § 1253.

At the Supreme Court, the Kansas case was heard along with three other cases (from South Carolina, Virginia, and Delaware) challenging segregation in public education.  These other cases, two of which had elementary and high school age plaintiffs and one with only high school age plaintiffs, all involved state constitutions and statutes that required segregation in public education.  In contrast, the Kansas statute permitted, but did not require, cities above a certain population to maintain racially-separate school facilities.  (Topeka's school board had elected to maintain segregated elementary schools.)  In the South Carolina and Virginia cases, the lower federal courts found the black students' schools to have been inferior and the states were directed to equalize the facilities and services;  however, the states' segregation laws were upheld and the plaintiffs were not provided access to the white students' schools during the mandated equalization programs.  In the Delaware case, a state trial court awarded the plaintiffs an order requiring their immediate admission to the white students' schools. The trial court cited the inferiority of the schools the state had provided to black students and accepted the view that segregation itself results in an inferior education.  Delaware's Supreme Court affirmed but intimated that, once equalization of the two sets of schools had been accomplished, the state might be able to obtain a modification of the decree.

On May 17, 1954, after twice having the parties and the United States, as amicus curiae, argue the case, the U.S. Supreme Court issued its unanimous opinion declaring that racially segregated schools were inherently unequal, and therefore deprived the plaintiffs of the equal protection of the laws guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment.  Brown v. Board of Education, 347 U.S. 483 (1954) (Earl Warren, Chief Justice).  In the four cases at issue, the lower courts had found the separate schools' ""tangible"" factors equal (or satisfactorily becoming so);  accordingly, the Supreme Court focused on the ""effect"" of segregation itself on public education.  In view of the importance of education as a state-provided function, the Court stated that once a state has undertaken to provide educational opportunity it must make the right available to all on equal terms.  Chief Justice Warren quoted the Kansas district court's observation that public school segregation has a detrimental effect which is greater when sanctioned by law, denoting black inferiority and affecting motivation to learn.  He found this observation amply supported by modern psychological authority, citing several recent studies and reports.  Recognizing the wide applicability of its decision and the variety of local conditions to which it must be applied, the Court requested the parties and the United States to again argue the case, specifically to address the formulation of remedial decrees.  In addition to restoring the case to the docket for further argument, the Court also invited amicus curiae briefs from those states requiring or permitting segregation in public education.

(In something of a sidelight to this historic decision, years later an internal memorandum became available which revealed the thoughts of a then-law clerk to Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson about the school desegregation cases.  The law clerk, William H. Rehnquist, later became a member of the Court (and its Chief Justice) but, as a law clerk in the early 1950's, he wrote that the desegregation cases' plaintiffs were wrongly asking the Court to read its own sociological views and personal moral preferences into the Constitution.  In his view, Plessy v. Ferguson was right and should be re-affirmed.  As the unanimous decision reflects, Justice Jackson did not follow his law clerk's advice.)

The Supreme Court's next decision in the case occurred on May 31, 1955.  In another unanimous opinion, again written by Chief Justice Warren, the Court remanded the cases to the trial courts for the crafting of appropriate decrees.  The opinion observed that these courts were best suited to assess local conditions and the good faith efforts of local school officials to implement governing constitutional principles.  The lower courts were reminded to consider the plaintiffs' personal interests in admission to public schools ""as soon as practicable"" on a nondiscriminatory basis, as well as the public interest in eliminating obstacles to such relief in an ""orderly and systematic"" manner.  The courts were directed to require the defendants to make a ""prompt and reasonable start toward full compliance"" with the earlier ruling.  This imprecise timeframe for action was not appreciably honed by the Court's directive that the lower courts, on remand, should ""take such proceedings and enter such orders and decrees consistent with this opinion as are necessary and proper to admit to public schools on a racially nondiscriminatory basis with all deliberate speed the parties to these cases.""  (The Delaware case, having been the sole affirmance of the four appealed cases, was remanded to that state's Supreme Court for proceedings it deemed necessary.)  Brown v. Board of Education, 399 U.S. 294 (1955).  

On remand in the Brown case, in Topeka, on August 2, 1955, the Kansas plaintiffs filed a motion in the district court for a hearing on the formulation of a decree.  The hearing occurred on August 24, 1955, followed by issuance of a per curiam opinion by the three judge court on October 28, 1955.  The court approved the plan the school board put in force for that school year.  The plan's central principle was that children would be required to attend school within the district of their residence, with rare exceptions, and that race or color would not be any part of any exception to the general rule.  Although the court viewed as insufficient one aspect of the plan, allowing (for that year only) kindergarten children to opt to attend schools inside or out of their residence district, the court decided that the plan sufficiently reflected the good faith of school authorities in attempting to adhere to the Supreme Court's rulings.  The court also noted that at least one all-black school would, because of residence demographics, remain all-black.  This result was acceptable, reasoned the court, because desegregation did not require intermingling but, instead, that children not be prevented from going to school together because of race or color.  (This conceptualization of the desegregation obligation was later disapproved by the Supreme Court in Green v. School Board of New Kent County and Swann w. Charlotte/Mecklenberg.)  The court retained jurisdiction over the case and regarded acceptance of the school board's plan as an interim measure.  

The docket is devoid of any subsequent activity of importance until 1979.  At that point, represented by private counsel, a group of black parents and schoolchildren filed a motion in the case to intervene as plaintiffs.  They also filed a motion asking the court to command compliance with the earlier ruling to desegregate Topeka's schools.  District Judge Richard Dean Rogers granted the motion to intervene.  Brown v. Board of Education, 84 F.R.D. 383 (D. Kan. 1979).  He noted that four separate cases had been filed during that decade seeking to eliminate alleged racial discrimination in Topeka's schools and that, in at least two of them, the state and the school board's successful positions had been that the plaintiffs in those cases should not be permitted to proceed and, instead, should file motions seeking relief in Brown v. Board of Education, since the court had expressly retained jurisdiction to enforce compliance with the Constitution.  The intervening plaintiffs alleged (1) the school board had created attendance zones that perpetuate racial discrimination, (2) schools with predominately black enrollment had facilities, equipment, curricula, and instruction substantially inferior to that provided in schools with predominately white enrollment, (3) racial disparity existed in school personnel assignments, (4) the school board had adopted an open enrollment policy perpetuating school segregation, and (5) the board adopted a long range facilities plan which also perpetuated school segregation.  Without resolving any of these claims, Judge Rogers made the procedural ruling that the movants could appropriately intervene as plaintiffs.  He found  it unpersuasive that passage of time had mooted the original plaintiffs' interest in the case, because the case was a class action (even though modern procedures for certifying a class action did not exist when the case had begun) and the intervenors had appropriate interests in seeking compliance with the Supreme Court's earlier orders.  

Discovery and motion proceedings followed, as did a trial, which resulted in the district court's order of April 9, 1987. Brown v. Board of Education, 671 F. Supp. 1290 (D. Kan. 1987).  Reviewing the case's history as well as other desegregation rulings, Judge Rogers observed that, in determining whether a unitary school system existed, he would assess whether characteristics of the dual system existing in 1954 either do not exist or, if they exist, whether they are not the result of past or present intentional segregative conduct of the defendants or their predecessors. He then reviewed the history of desegregation efforts in the Topeka schools, noting that some desegregation, at the high school level, preceded the 1951 filing of this case.  The trial evidence included statistics which, according to the plaintiffs, demonstrated a lack of racial balance in the district's schools, in the sense that many schools' racial mix did not reflect the racial mix of the district.  The judge, however, saw the statistics as a result of residential patterns, not as remnants of past discrimination nor of present intentionally discriminatory conduct.  He added that the plaintiffs had not presented sufficient evidence for him to find that the residential patterns were the product of discriminatory conduct.  Likewise, school transfer policies, attendance zone decisions, school space and site decisions, school closings and openings, school boundary locations, facilities quality, activities and curriculum, transportation, faculty and staff assignments, test scores, opportunities to take desegregative action, and other factors were reviewed and found racially neutral.  Judge Rogers stated that the existence of some schools having a statistical predominance of one race was not the product of overt or covert intentionally segregative conduct.  Thus, the new plaintiffs also could not prevail on their claim that the defendants violated Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, since that act prohibits only intentional discrimination in operation of schools receiving federal funds and the act's implementing regulations prohibiting racially discriminatory effects had not been shown to have been violated.  Judge Rogers also ruled that the Kansas governor was dismissed as a defendant and that no evidence established liability of the state's school board.  The public school system in Topeka was adjudged a unitary one.  The plaintiffs' claims for relief were denied and they were ordered to pay the defendants' costs.

With assistance from ACLU attorneys, plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit.  In a lengthy opinion, the appellate court upheld, 2-1, limited aspects of the district court's ruling but reversed the lower court's main conclusions.  Brown v. Board of Education, 892 F.2d 851 (10th Cir. 1989) (Circuit Judge Stephanie Kulp Seymour).  In sum, Judge Seymour faulted the district court's placing the burden of proving intentional discrimination on the plaintiffs, rather than according plaintiffs the presumption that existing racial disparities in the school system were causally related to past discriminatory conduct.  Reviewing the evidence with the burden of proof properly assigned, the appellate court concluded that the defendants had failed in meeting their burden of proving that the effects of past intentional discrimination had dissipated.  The lower court's ruling on the alleged Title VI violation also was error, according to Judge Seymour, who affirmed the district court's dismissal of the state's governor from the case and the finding that the state's recently-created school board had no liability.  

The defendants sought review in the U.S. Supreme Court.  In a brief order, Brown v. Board of Education, 503 U.S. 978 (1992), that court granted certiorari, vacated the Tenth Circuit's judgment, and remanded the case for further proceedings in light of two recent Supreme Court decisions, Freeman v. Pitts, 503 U.S. 467 (1992), and Bd. of Educ. of Oklahoma City v. Dowell, 498 U.S. 237 (1991), each of which suggested that district courts should aim in school desegregation cases to relinquish jurisdiction when possible.  

On remand, the appellate court reinstated its prior opinion in full, again citing the local school board's failure of proof and its' inaction rather than taking sufficient affirmative steps in the area of student and faculty/staff assignments to eliminate the vestiges of past discrimination.  Judge Seymour, again writing for a 2-1 court, was of the view that the recent Supreme Court decisions changed nothing in the analysis.  Brown v. Board of Education, 978 F.2d 585 (10th Cir. 1992).  The Supreme Court declined review, so the case returned to the district court.

There, in a December 3, 1993, unpublished order, Judge Rogers stated that the issue before him was limited to the crafting of a remedial plan to eliminate the vestiges of de jure segregation in student and faculty/staff assignments.  In his view, other aspects of the school system, such as educational performance, disciplinary outcomes, or classroom assignments were not part of the direct mandate from the Tenth Circuit.  Discovery on remand was to be limited accordingly.  

Also addressed on remand were the plaintiffs' motions for recovery of their attorneys' fees and litigation costs.  The district court ruled that the fees would be calculated using local standards, rather than the higher rates prevailing in New York, where the ACLU attorneys were housed.  Judge Rogers also ruled that volunteer paralegals' time spent on the case would not result in reimbursement, nor would counsel's travel time or secretarial and word processing costs.  He decided, however, not to reduce the amount of recovery based on the fact that the plaintiffs were not fully successful.  Brown v. Unified School District No. 501, 878 F. Supp. 1430 (D. Kan. 1995).  

In 1999, the district court made its final ruling in the case.  The ruling resulted from the motion of the defendant for a declaration of unitary status and order of dismissal. The plaintiffs did not oppose the motion.  In ruling on the motion, Judge Rogers considered that the school board, after the most recent remand from the appellate court, had adopted and implemented a remedial plan with guidelines which prevented any school from being identified as a majority or minority school on the basis of the race of its faculty and staff.  Likewise, the plan addressed student assignments at individual elementary, middle, and high schools in a way that, in recent years, kept minority and majority student populations within 15% of the minority and majority student figures for the district at large.  The court also noted the defendant's on-going multi-cultural education programs for students, faculty, and staff, and an announced commitment to diversity and intolerance of discrimination.  Granting the motion for a declaration of unitary status for the school district, Judge Rogers ruled that the vestiges of past discrimination in the school district had been eliminated to the extent practicable; and defendant had demonstrated a good faith commitment to the law and the Constitution which presaged no future need for judicial intervention.  He dismissed the case on July 27, 1999.  Brown v. Unified School District No. 501, 56 F. Supp.2d 1212 (D. Kan. 1999).","
""Brown v. Board of Education of Topeka, Kansas"" is a comprehensive document that recounts the legal proceedings and final verdict of the landmark case that challenged racial segregation in public schools. The case, initiated in 1951 by thirteen African American parents on behalf of their children, was brought against the Topeka Board of Education, the defendant in the case. Represented by renowned attorneys Thurgood Marshall and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the plaintiffs alleged that the segregation of public schools based on race was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. They argued that the district's policies and actions, such as school boundary changes and new school constructions, maintained a dual system of segregation and denied their children equal educational opportunities. In response, the defendants denied these claims and argued that they had taken steps towards desegregation, such as hiring minority faculty and implementing a desegregative transfer policy. The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a court order to fully desegregate the school district, while the defendants argued that further desegregation efforts were not feasible.

The case went through multiple legal proceedings, starting with the District Court's ruling in favor of the defendants, citing the ""separate but equal"" doctrine. However",0.8565,0.0527,0.0993,0.375,0.023,0.0433,0.5072,0.0312,0.0588
EE-TX-0357,"In March 2006 the Houston District Office of the EEOC filed this lawsuit against shuttle service provider Ethio Express Shuttle Service Inc., doing business as Texans Shuttle, in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas alleging discrimination on the basis of race and national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the complaint alleged the defendant discriminated against African-American drivers who were native to the United States in favor of those recently from Africa in making route assignments, tip distributions, and other terms and conditions of their employment.  Shortly after answering the complaint, the defendant declared bankruptcy.  After the EEOC had the case reopened, the EEOC successfully motioned for default judgment.  The judgment ordered the defendant to pay the complaining parties $37,197 and enjoined them from discriminating on the basis of race or national origin.

","

This case, entitled Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Ethio Express Shuttle Service Inc., involves allegations of unlawful employment practices by the defendant company. The lawsuit was filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) on behalf of four former employees of Ethio Express - Andrew Cooper, Michael Calligan, Maralisia Mack, and Gerald K. Fields. These individuals are all black Americans and were employed as drivers by Ethio Express, a transportation company operating in the Houston metropolitan area. The EEOC alleges that these employees were subjected to discrimination based on their race and national origin, including being assigned less desirable routes and having their tips reduced. The lawsuit also claims that non-Ethiopian drivers were treated differently in terms of lease terms, dress code, meeting attendance, and van quality. The EEOC is seeking a permanent injunction to prevent these discriminatory practices and to order Ethio Express to implement policies and programs that promote equal employment opportunities for all employees. The lead attorney for the EEOC is Timothy M. Bowne, and they are requesting a jury trial for this case.

IM-TX-0053,"COVID-19 Summary: This is a habeas action filed by four immigrants held at the Montgomery Processing Center, seeking release in light of COVID-19. The plaintiffs alleged that they were particularly vulnerable to the virus due to their medical conditions. In April, the court issued a temporary restraining order that provided for the release of one of the individual plaintiffs. In September, the court entered an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for individualized bail hearings. Three detainees were released in October. The defendants appealed in November. The case is ongoing. <hr>

On April 8, 2020, a group of four immigrants in detention filed this lawsuit against U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (""ICE""), ICE officials, and the warden of the Montgomery Processing Center (""MPC""). Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the petitioners sought writs of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Alternatively, they sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the petitioners argued that by detaining them, the defendants were subjecting them to an unreasonable risk of contracting COVID-19 in violation of the Fifth Amendment.

The case was assigned to Judge Keith P. Ellison.

On April 10, the plaintiffs filed a motion for temporary restraining order.

On April 17, Judge Ellison entered an order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion for a temporary restraining order. 455 F.Supp.3d 330. The government was required to release one plaintiff from detention because the plaintiff did not have a history of violence, so the danger to the plaintiff in detention outweighed the public interest in safety; the court issued this order as a preliminary injunction rather than a temporary restraining order. The court declined to order the release of another plaintiff due to his history of violence and violation of previous court protective orders. Ten days later that plaintiff was transferred to a different detention facility. (The two other individual plaintiffs had already been released.) 

On April 29, the plaintiffs filed an amended class action complaint with four additionally plaintiffs with medical conditions that put them at higher risk of serious illness or death if they contracted COVID-19. Two of those plaintiffs were later released on May 1. The plaintiffs also filed a motion to certify the class. The proposed class consisted of ""all individuals detained at MPC who have been diagnosed with or are receiving treatment for an enumerated list of medical conditions... and/or who are over the age of 50."" 

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction on May 1 on the basis that the plaintiffs' claims were mooted after each was either transferred or released. On May 1 and 4, the plaintiffs moved to expedite discovery and to expedite relief. In the meantime, at least six detainees and five MPC staff members had tested positive for COVID-19. 

On May 25, the court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss because the plaintiff that secured release through the April 17 preliminary injunction still had standing to amend the complaint since her claims had not been finally adjudicated. The court also ordered that plaintiffs submit supplemental information on the proposed class certification before the court rule on the other outstanding motions. 2020 WL 2617939.

Defendants filed another motion to dismiss the amended complaint on June 5. Plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order on June 7 which was denied as moot on June 23. Several detainees filed an emergency motion to intervene on July 30 which was granted on August 31. The court found that the intervenors met the requirements for permissive intervention, but not intervention as of right.

The intervenors filed a complaint, adopting the prior allegations and making additional allegations, and a motion for a temporary restraining order on September 4. 

On September 10, the court denied defendants' motion to dismiss and on September 21, the court declined to grant provisional class certification, but granted in part plaintiffs' motion for expedited relief and outlined a process for the parties to proceed with individualized bail hearings for plaintiffs with high risk medical conditions that did not have violent and felonious criminal histories. 2020 WL 5646138. The court noted that by July 29, the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases among detainees at MPC was reported to be 206. By August 11, defendants reported zero active cases and deaths, but the court noted that it ""lack[ed] confidence in these numbers."" The court also noted that ""the timeline of events at MPC demonstrates that, despite the measures [d]efendants allegedly implemented, the detention facility nonetheless experienced a significant outbreak of COVID-19 while those measures were already in place.""

In October, the court granted bail for three detainees and denied bail for one detainee. 2020 WL 6130717. On November 20, the defendants appealed the bail determinations and the court's September 21 order granting the plaintiffs' motion for individualized bail hearings. 

The case is ongoing. ","

This case, titled ""In Re: Habeas Corpus Petition of Immigrant Detainees at Montgomery Processing Center,"" involves a group of plaintiffs who are medically vulnerable and currently detained at the Montgomery Processing Center (MPC) in Texas. The defendants, who are responsible for the operations of MPC, argue that the continued detention of the plaintiffs is necessary and constitutional, while the plaintiffs claim that their continued detention is a violation of their constitutional rights, as they face a serious risk to their health due to the highly contagious and lethal nature of COVID-19 in the detention facility. The plaintiffs, represented by their attorneys, are seeking bail and provisional class certification for all detainees at MPC who have underlying medical conditions or are over the age of 50. The plaintiffs argue that their circumstances are exceptional and that they have a high chance of success in their constitutional claims.

The court has heard arguments from both sides, with the plaintiffs presenting evidence of the worsening conditions at MPC and the defendants arguing that they have implemented appropriate measures to prevent the spread of the virus. The court has granted a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on their claims that their detention is a violation of due process.

The plaintiff, an author of a Pulitzer-prize winning book about the Attica Prison uprising, wished for her book to be made available to prisoners who are under the authority of the Illinois Department of Correction (IDOC). Her complaint alleged that the defendants, employees of IDOC, improperly censored her book by preventing it from being distributed in some of the prisons in the state. The complaint further alleged a violation of the plaintiff's free speech and due process rights, because there was no process available to challenge the censorship.

The case was assigned to Judge Sue E. Myerscough. The Uptown People's Law Center represent the plaintiff.

Subsequently, on September 29, 2020, the plaintiff filed for partial summary judgment and the defendants filed a separate motion for summary judgment one day later. In late October, the parties filed their respective response motions.

Heather Ann Thompson, a renowned professor and historian, has filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Central District of Illinois against Defendants John R. Baldwin, Michael Melvin, Teri Kennedy, David Meredith, and Emily Ruskin. Thompson, the author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning book ""Blood in the Water,"" alleges that the defendants, all employees of the Illinois Department of Corrections, violated her constitutional rights by censoring her book at three different prisons within the department. She claims that two copies of her book were rejected without explanation, while one was delivered to a prisoner. Thompson argues that this censorship without due process, such as notice and the opportunity to appeal, is a violation of her First and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The defendants, acting under color of state law, are being sued in both their official and individual capacities for damages and injunctive relief. Thompson is represented by a team of attorneys, and she has requested a trial by jury. The case has progressed to the defendants' motion for summary judgment, to which Thompson has responded, requesting that the court deny the motion and allow the case to proceed to trial on the merits. The outcome of the case is still pending as the court reviews the evidence and arguments presented by both parties. Thompson seeks",0.5275,0.434,0.4762,0.2212,0.1818,0.1996,0.3028,0.2491,0.2733
PB-CA-0016,"In 2008 and 2009, the California Legislature passed three statutes modifying the State's Medicaid plan, reducing payments made to health providers.  Under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 1396 et seq. (The Medicaid Act), such modifications must be approved by the federal Department of Health and Human Services Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) prior to being put in place. In September and December 2008, California submitted amendment proposals to CMS that incorporated most of the rate reductions the Legislature had already included in the three statutes. This suit, and several others seeking injunctions to prevent the rate reductions, was filed before CMS had completed its review of the amendments.

The Independent Living Center of Southern California (a disability advocacy group), two branches of the Gray Panthers (a healthcare and anti-ageism advocacy organization), individual Medicaid benefit recipients, and several pharmacies and pharmacists (collectively, ""the petitioners"") filed this suit as a petition for writ of mandamus to compel the State of California not to implement the reductions to its Medicaid program (""Medi-Cal""). The providers argued that if the cutbacks were approved, the state would not provide the level of care required under Medicaid.  The case was originally filed in the Los Angeles County Superior Court on April 22, 2008, but was removed to federal U.S. District Court for the Central District of California on May 19, 2008. The defendants had requested the removal to federal court; the removal was granted because the case involved questions of federal law.

According to the plaintiffs' Petition for Mandamus, prior to the rate reduction, California Medicaid rates for physicians were 61% or less of what Medicare paid for the same services. The plaintiffs claimed that ""as a result of the low Medi-Cal rates, only 55% of primary care physicians and less than 50% of specialists [were] willing to participate in the Medi-Cal program."" They argued that a ten percent reduction in the fee-for-service rate would reduce physician participation to even lower levels.  The plaintiffs alleged that the rate reductions violated the Medicaid Act, because they had not been approved by CMS and because the State had failed to study the potential effects of the rate reductions on the quality of and level of access to care available to Medi-Cal recipients. Plaintiffs argued that California had not shown that, were the rate reductions to go into effect, the State would be able to enlist enough providers as to make Medi-Cal services sufficiently available to benefit recipients, as required by 42 U. S. C. §1396a(a)(30)(A). The plaintiffs alleged that because these rate reductions violated the Medicaid Act, they were therefore preempted by federal law due to the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to find that the rate reduction was a violation of federal law and to prevent its enforcement. They also maintained that the rate reduction was prohibited by the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”).

On May 30, 2008, the petitioners filed a motion for a preliminary injunction that would prevent the rate reductions from coming into effect until further review by the District Court. On June 25th, the Court (Judge Christina A. Snyder) denied this motion, finding that the petitioners’ case had no likelihood of succeeding because the Medicaid Act did not expressly create an individual right that could be the basis of a cause of action and therefore the petitioners probably did not have standing to bring their suit. Independent Living Center of Southern California v. Shewry, 2008 WL 4298223 (C.D. Cal. 2008). The petitioners appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which vacated the lower court's decision on July 11, 2008, finding that the Supremacy Clause could serve as the basis for their action. Independent Living Center of Southern California v. Shewry, 543 F.3d 1047 (9th Cir. 2008). 

In light of the Ninth Circuit's order, on August 18, 2008, District Judge Snyder granted in part and denied in part the petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that their Supremacy Clause case was likely to succeed on its merits. The Court therefore issued a preliminary injunction against the implementation of the Medi-Cal fee-for-service rate reductions for physicians, dentists, pharmacies, adult day health care centers, clinics, and health systems for services provided on or after July 1, 2008. Independent Living Center of Southern California v. Shewry, 2008 WL 3891211 (C.D. Cal. 2008).  On August 27, 2008, the Court issued an order modifying this injunction, so that it did not retroactively apply to the period between July 1 and August 18, 2008. On November 17, 2008, Judge Snyder granted the petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction against the rate reductions for non-emergency medical transportation services and for in-home health services. On July 9, 2009, the Ninth Circuit (Judge Milan D. Smith Jr.) affirmed the ruling establishing the injunction, and reversed the modification. Independent Living Center of Southern California v. Maxwell-Jolly, 572 F.3d 644 (9th Cir. 2009).

Back in the district court, on March 26, 2010, Judge Snyder granted a motion to allow several outside groups to join the case as intervenor plaintiffs, who raised issues similar to those of the original petitioners. Independent Living Center of Southern California v. Shewry, 2010 WL 1235762 (C.D. Cal. 2010). 

On February 10, 2010, the defendants sought review in the United States Supreme Court of the decision of the Ninth Circuit holding that the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution could serve as a basis for a cause of action in this case. The Supreme Court granted certiorari review on January 18, 2011, consolidating this case with four others that raised the same issue, 131 S.Ct. 992 (2011). These four cases were California Pharmacists Association v. Maxwell-Jolly (Clearinghouse case code PB-CA-0020), Managed Pharmacy Care v. Maxwell-Jolly (PB-CA-0019), Dominguez v. Schwarzenegger (DR-CA-0031), and Santa Rosa Memorial Hospital v. Shewry (Docket #: 3:08-cv-05173-SC). On June 1, 2011, Judge Snyder issued an order removing this action from the list of active District Court cases pending the decision of the Supreme Court.

Oral argument before the Supreme Court took place on October 3, 2011.  After oral argument, while the cases were pending in the Supreme Court, CMS approved California's amendments to its Medicaid plan.  In light of this, on February 22, 2012, the Supreme Court declined to issue a ruling on whether the Supremacy Clause could serve as a basis for a private suit to enforce Title XIX against a state. Instead, the Supreme Court vacated the Ninth Circuit Court's decision and remanded the case to the Ninth Circuit for reconsideration, with instructions to take into account CMS's approval of the amendments. Douglas v. Independent Living Center of Southern California, 132 S. Ct. 1204 (2012).

On April 12, 2012, the petitioners moved to have the stay lifted in the District Court. The Court denied this motion because issues that would be determinative of the outcome of the case were still awaiting adjudication at the Ninth Circuit Court. Independent Living Center of Southern California v. Douglas, 2012 WL 1622346 (C.D. Cal. 2012). Following the Supreme Court’s ruling, the parties entered into mediation efforts.  On May 22, 2012, the parties' unanimous joint motion to enter mediation, and to stay the supplemental briefing schedule during the pendancy of mediation was granted by the Ninth Circuit.

The District Court directed the parties to submit a joint status report, which was filed on July 23, 2013.  On November 5, 2013, the District Court reviewed the parties' positions from the joint status report, as well as issues presented in a certiorari petition pending in the United States Supreme Court in a totally different case (brought by other parties against the same defendant, involving some but not all the same issues)(Managed Pharmacy Care v. Sebelius, S.Ct. Docket 13-253).  In this and another 19 similar cases, the District Court stayed or continued an existing stay of the proceedings.  

The parties then settled, and filed a joint request for dismissal of several appeals in the Ninth Circuit; this was granted on May 28, 2014.  Back in the district court, on August 14, 2014 the parties filed a Joint Motion for Approval of Settlement Agreement; Judge Snyder granted the motion on September 22, 2014.

In the settlement, all parties agreed to dismiss any remaining pending appeals pursuant to the original preliminary injunction. The petitioners also agreed to dismiss the entire case with prejudice.  The District Court retained jurisdiction to decide the plaintiffs’ motions for attorneys' fees, and also to determine any of the plaintiffs’ motions to enforce the Agreement up to January 1, 2016.  Each side would bear its own costs, outside of any plaintiffs’ attorneys’ fees that the District Court decided to award.  Since fee-for-service delivery systems are where health care providers are paid for each service, the preliminary injunction against rate reductions for Medi-Cal cost the defendants money. Due to this, the defendants had filed claims against Medi-Cal providers in order to recoup these funds. In the Settlement Agreement, the defendants agreed to forego these claims outside of a few specified exceptions.   

The plaintiffs also agreed to release state and federal entities from liability for claims concerning payment reductions, unless the claims related to the accuracy of reimbursement.  In return, the defendants agreed to release the plaintiff from liability for claims of “excess payment”, including payments made while the preliminary injunction was in effect, but where the rate reductions ultimately received federal approval.  

After the Settlement Agreement was approved, pursuant to its terms, on April 22, 2015, the petitioners and intervenors filed to dismiss the case and made a motion for attorneys’ fees and costs as the prevailing party. They also brought three other motions for attorneys’ fees and costs the next day.  On April 23, 2015, Judge Snyder, considering application, ordered that this case be dismissed with prejudice, and that each party bear its own costs in accordance with the Settlement Agreement. Judge Snyder declined to grant any attorneys' fees.

On July 24 and 28, 2015, the plaintiff and intervenors appealed to the Ninth Circuit this order denying fees. On November 21, 2018, the Ninth Circuit vacated and remanded this case to the district court to determine whether the appellants (plaintiff and intervenors) should recover attorneys’ fees, and, if so, the amount of the award. The court also remanded for a determination of whether appellants can recover any fees from the relief obtained in 2010. Judge Milan Smith Jr., writing for the majority, found that the district court abused its discretion in denying plaintiffs’ motion to set aside funds for attorneys’ fees following the decision permitting retroactive monetary relief from the Medi-Cal reimbursement reduction. On January 14, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court also denied the plaintiff and intervenors' petition for rehearing en banc.

The case is still ongoing in the district court to determine the payment of attorney's fees. On April 10, 2019 the plaintiffs and the intervenors filed motions for attorney's fees.  The defendants opposed these motions.  A hearing on the motion for attorney's fees was held on June 24, 2019.  On August 6, 2019, the court denied the motion.  The court ordered additional briefing on the issue, which was submitted by both parties in August and September 2019.  Oral argument was held on January 13, 2020.

On January 24, 2020, Judge Snyder granted the motion for attorney's fees.  The court awarded the intervenor's counsel $4,254,713.88, and awarded the plaintiff's counsel $2,731,800. 2020 WL 418947.

The plaintiff's appealed the decision on attorney's fees to the Ninth Circuit (Appeal Docket No. 20-55193 ) on February 21, 2020.  The plaintiff-appellants filed their opening briefs on June 30, 2020.  The defendant-appelles have not yet filed a brief in opposition.  As of July 2020, the Ninth Circuit appeal remains ongoing.","

This document, titled ""Summary of Independent Living Center of Southern California, Inc. v. Maxwell-Jolly: A Case on Medicaid Rate Reductions,"" is a comprehensive overview of the legal dispute between various healthcare providers, senior citizens' groups, and beneficiaries of California's Medicaid program, Medi-Cal, against the Director of the Department of Health Care Services for the State of California. The plaintiffs alleged that a ten percent reduction in Medi-Cal reimbursement rates violated the Supremacy Clause of the U.S. Constitution and sought to prevent the implementation of these cuts. They argued that the reduction was inconsistent with a federal law requiring that Medicaid payments be sufficient to ensure care and services are available to the general population in the geographic area. The defendants, the Director and the State of California, argued that there was no private right of action under the Supremacy Clause to enforce the Medicaid Act. The case was heard before District Judge Christina A. Snyder, and after extensive discovery and briefing, the district court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, enjoining the Director from implementing the rate reduction. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed this decision, finding that the state had not demonstrated that its amended Medicaid plan would provide sufficient services and that these amendments conflicted with federal law.

ED-HI-0003,"On July 27, 2010, four students with disabilities and the Hawaii Disability Rights Center filed this class action against the Hawaii Department of Education seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs, represented by Hawaii Disability Rights Center, contended that the Department was failing to comply with its obligations to provide a Free Accessible Public Education (FAPE) under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) and their right to a discrimination-free education under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. The case was assigned to District Judge Susan Oki Mollway. 

At the time the complaint was filed, the disabled individuals who brought the suit were over twenty but under twenty-two years old and had previously received a FAPE under the IDEA. However, following the establishment of a new Hawaii Law, Act 163, these individuals were denied a FAPE because they were over twenty years of age. 

The plaintiffs moved for class certification and a preliminary injunction. District Judge David Alan Ezra signed an order granting in part and denying in part the motion for class certification on March 15, 2011. 272 F.R.D. 541. The judge also issued an order denying plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 2011 WL 2746800. Defendants then moved for a motion to dismiss or in the alternative, for summary judgment, and the plaintiffs renewed their motion for a preliminary injunction and moved for summary judgment. Judge Ezra then issued an order denying plaintiff's motion for summary judgment, granting in part and denying in part the defendant's motion to dismiss, and denying plaintiff's renewed motion for preliminary relief. 817 F.Supp.2d 1182.

In 2012, the case went to a bench trial. Judge Alan Ezra held that the plaintiffs failed to prove the Hawaii Department of Education violated the IDEA, ACA, and Rehabilitation Act and entered judgment for the defendants. 2012 WL 1082250. The case was then appealed to the Ninth Circuit. On August 28, 2013, the Ninth Circuit announced its conclusion, affirming in part and reversing in part. 728 F.3d 982. The court found that the State of Hawaii offered public education to nondisabled students between the ages of 20 and 22 through its Community Schools for Adults. The court held that so long as the State continued to provide such an education to nondisabled students under 22, it was required under IDEA to provide a FAPE to disabled students in the same age bracket. The court reversed and remanded the case on the IDEA count. The court affirmed the district court's finding that the plaintiffs failed to prove that the Department was required to make such changes as a ""reasonable accommodation."" Accordingly, the court affirmed the lower court's judgement in favor of the Department on the ACA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  The court also awarded costs on appeal to the Plaintiffs. 

After being remanded to district court, and after the case was reassigned to Judge Susan Oki Mollway, the class was recertified. Subsequently, the parties began settlement conferences. On December 8, 2017, Judge Oki Mollway issued an order approving settlement for class members. As part of the settlement, the Department of Education agreed to fund the requisite services and pay $8.2 million dollars to class members, $1.5 million for attorneys' fees, and up to $250,000 to class counsel for future services rendered in relation to the administration of the settlement. 

The administration of the settlement continues. The case remains open. ","

This is a comprehensive summary of the case, ""Settlement Agreement in Class Action Lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Education,"" filed in 2010 by plaintiffs E.R.K., R.T.D., and the Hawai'i Disability Rights Center against the Hawaii Department of Education (HIDOE). The plaintiffs alleged that the HIDOE violated federal laws by not providing special education and related services to eligible students until they earned a regular diploma or reached the age of 22. The plaintiffs sought compensatory education for the HIDOE's failure to provide appropriate services. The case was overseen by United States Magistrate Judge Kevin S. C. Chang, who facilitated discussions between the parties to determine the needs and interests of the Class Members, as well as the costs and potential providers for the needed services. After careful deliberation, an order was issued approving a settlement for the Class Members, which included the allocation and distribution of $10,250,000 for the provision of compensatory education and other related services.

The plaintiffs in this case included E.R.K., R.T.D., and the Hawai'i Disability Rights Center, who represented themselves and others similarly situated. They alleged that the HIDOE's policy of limiting access to free public education for disabled students over the age of 20,",0.6449,0.2359,0.3454,0.2019,0.0736,0.1079,0.3037,0.1111,0.1627

Matsch.  The Plaintiff claimed that numerous architectural and other barriers to accessibility prevented him from full participation as a student in violation of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794; and Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12181 et seq. 

Specifically, Plaintiff claimed that he encountered automatic doors which did not open, elevators that did not work, transportation available to students but without disabled access, and classroom configurations that segregated him in the back of the room. He sought declaratory, injunctive and monetary relief. 

 

On July 21, 1998, the court granted a stipulated motion to dismiss with prejudice, with each party bearing its own costs and attorneys' fees.  There is no settlement agreement or other similar document available in this case.

EE-IN-0121,"On September 25, 2002, the United States filed a lawsuit under Title VII against the Indiana Department of Transportation in the (""INDOT"") United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana. The United States alleged that the Department of Transportation discriminated against an Indian-American employee on the basis of his national origin. Specifically, the plaintiff contended that INDOT failed or refused to promote an Indian-American employee to a vacancy in the Highway Engineer Supervisor 3 classification and failed or refused to take appropriate action to remedy the effects of the discriminatory treatment of this employee. The United States sought injunctive and remedial relief.

The EEOC investigated the charge, found reasonable cause to believe that the allegation of national origin discrimination was true, attempted unsuccessfully to achieve a voluntary resolution of the charge through conciliation and subsequently referred the matter to the DOJ.

On September 3, 2003, the plaintiff and the defendant entered into a consent decree ordered by the district court (Judge Sarah Evans Barker). The consent decree ordered INDOT to pay the plaintiff back pay and contribute adjusted retirement benefits to his retirement account, which represent the amount the State would have contributed to his retirement account had he been promoted to the Highway Engineer Supervisor 3 classification. INDOT agreed to place the plaintiff in the Executive Broadband classification as the Environment/Planning and Engineering Consultant Services Manager. Additionally, defendant agreed not to engage in any act or practice that unlawfully retaliates against the plaintiff for exercising his rights under Title VII.  Furthermore, INDOT agreed not to unlawfully discriminate against any employee because of national origin and to provide employment discrimination awareness training to all supervisory and management personnel, as well as to any other individuals employed by INDOT who participate in the process by which individuals are selected for a promotion by INDOT. Finally, INDOT agreed to retain all relevant records for the duration of this Consent Decree.  In return, the plaintiff executed a release.

This document is a comprehensive summary of a civil case filed in 2002 by the United States of America against the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT). The case was brought on behalf of Tarlochan Bansi, an Indian-American employee, who alleged discrimination based on his national origin. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) found reasonable cause to believe that discrimination had occurred. The United States filed a complaint against INDOT, alleging that the department failed to promote Mr. Bansi and take appropriate action to remedy the discrimination. The complaint sought an injunction to prevent further discrimination and compensatory damages for Mr. Bansi. The United States also demanded a trial by jury and listed the attorneys involved in the case.

The case was assigned to Judge Sarah Evans Barker and Judge V. Sue Shields, and several status conferences and motions were filed by both parties. The court ordered a settlement conference, which was vacated, and a pretrial conference was scheduled. The United States filed a witness and exhibit list, and both parties attended several status conferences to discuss the progress of the case.

JC-TX-0020,"On November 15, 2007, an individual who was strip searched after being charged with a petty crime filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas. Represented by the Texas Civil Rights Project and private counsel, the plaintiff sued under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, challenging as unconstitutional Bexar County Detention Center's policy or custom of strip searching misdemeanant arrestees even where they were not suspected of concealing weapons or contraband.

Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that she was arrested for an outstanding traffic warrant and taken to the Bexar County Detention Center, where she was subjected to a strip search upon admission. The plaintiff further alleged that, after being held for two days, she and 25 other pretrial detainees were ordered to change into jail-issued uniforms, at which time she was again strip searched. The plaintiffs allege that detainees were told to manipulate genitalia and sometimes ""squat and cough"" regardless of whether there was reasonable suspicion of contraband or weapons. The plaintiff claimed that the strip searches violated her Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights in that they were conducted in the absence of any reasonable suspicion that she was hiding weapons or contraband. To remedy the alleged constitutional violation, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification. 

On April 2, 2009, both parties agreed to a consent decree that would provide permanent injunctive relief without further litigation. The decree dictated that the County Detention Center would no longer, absent reasonable suspicion that someone is concealing contraband, engage in the practice of strip searching or visual cavity searching those in their custody who are charged with misdemeanors. The County Detention Center also had to provide the court with an annual report regarding the implementation of the consent decree. Nothing in the consent decree addressed the plaintiff's request for compensatory and punitive damages. The court retained jurisdiction to enforce the decree. The decree was signed by Judge Fred Biery of the Western District of Texas. 

On November 16, 2009, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint. The parties continued to engage in discovery and settlement talks to resolve the damages claims. On August 26, 2010, the plaintiffs' submitted a motion of preliminary approval of the class-action settlement. The court preliminarily approved the settlement on October 13, 2010. After a fairness hearing, a final order of approval was granted on January 12, 2011.

The settlement agreement certified a class of plaintiffs composed of all detainees of Bexar County Detention Center between November 2005 and April 2009 who were subjected to strip searches and booked on misdemeanor or other minor charges. Those with felonies were not included. The class also had two subclasses. Subclass I was composed of all detainees not in subclass II, and subclass II included detainees booked on narcotics, shoplifting, and weapons-violation misdemeanors. All members of the class were to receive a pro rata share of the settlement after administrative expenses, attorneys' fees, and other expenses are counted for. 

Attorneys' fees were $900,000 for this case. The court found this reasonable considering the amount of time put in and the complexity of the case. The settlement included $395,000 for the claim administrator, and $15,000 was given to the three class representatives for their work in the lawsuit. The fund was then be used to pay class members. Class members in subclass I could receive up to $1,000, and members of subclass II can receive up to $100. Class members could pay off court fines and fees in Bexar County with their settlement funds, but this was capped at $500 and $50 for the subclasses respectively.

On January 28, 2013, however, the district court dismissed this case, thus vacating and revoking the settlement agreement. In 2012, the Supreme Court decided <i>Florence v. Board of Chosen Freeholders of County of Burlington</i>, holding that jail administrators may require all arrestees committed to the general population of the jail to undergo a no-touch visual strip search, even if the detainees is booked for a minor offense or reasonable suspicion is absent. The plaintiffs, their attorneys, and class members were not required to pay back any fees or funds they were awarded, but the County no longer needed to abide by the consent decree from April 9, 2009, that details how their strip search policy is to be conducted. They were now guided by the decision in <i>Florence</i>.","

This document is a compilation of court documents for case 5:07-cv-928, a class action lawsuit filed by Erica Bernal, Julia Ann Jackson, and Martin Martinez against the County of Bexar. The plaintiffs allege that the strip search policies and procedures at the Bexar County Adult Detention Center are unconstitutional and violate their rights under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. The defendant, represented by attorneys Alexander E. Barnett and Alexandra C. Warren, denied any liability or wrongdoing and stated its commitment to providing equal employment opportunities and a workplace free from discrimination.

The lawsuit seeks monetary damages, a declaration that the detention center's policies are unconstitutional, and an injunction to prevent further violations of rights.

Lupis filed a motion for summary judgment in September 2006 which was never resolved.  The parties entered into a consent judgment on December 21, 2006.  The consent judgment enjoined Lupis from future discrimination and required development of a policy against sexual harassment, Title VII compliance training for managerial and supervisory staff and posting of notice of compliance with Title VII.

The document titled ""Summary of Civil Case in U.S. District Court for Northern Illinois"" provides a thorough report on the legal proceedings between plaintiff Kenneth Flaxman and defendants County of Will, Steven Brooks, and Paul J Kaupas. Flaxman filed the case in January 2006, alleging wrongdoing by the defendants and seeking relief. The defendants, represented by attorneys from the County of Will, were accused of physical assault and false charges against the plaintiff while he was in custody at the Will County Adult Detention Facility. Flaxman's attorney, Antonio Vieyra, claimed that on April 8, 2004, defendant Steven Brooks, who was working as a Will County Sheriff at the time, physically assaulted Flaxman. Despite the plaintiff's allegations, he was charged with aggravated battery and resisting a peace officer, which he claims were based on false information.

FA-NY-0007,"On October 20, 2016, Color of Change and Center for Constitutional Rights, nonprofit civil rights advocacy and communications organizations, brought this action under the Freedom of Information Act (""FOIA"") in the Southern District of New York. The plaintiffs, represented by an attorney from the Milton Kramer Law Clinic at Case Western, an attorney from the Center for Constitutional Rights, and an attorney for Clifford Chance, sued the U.S. Department of Homeland security (""DHS"") and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (""FBI""), seeking declaratory, injunctive, and other appropriate relief to compel the defendants to produce records related to federal government surveillance and monitoring of protest activities related to the Movement for Black Lives (""MBL""). 

Following the shooting of 18-year-old Michael Brown by a police officer in Ferguson, Missouri, MBL gained national scope and influence, drawing public attention to police violence and advocating for police reform and racial justice. The plaintiffs alleged in their complaint that government documents, news reports, and first-hand accounts demonstrated that the defendants, and state and local law enforcement agencies, had engaged in surveillance and monitoring of MBL demonstrations and individual activists aligned with the movement, using tactics and measures commonly reserved for counterterrorism and national security related purposes. They further alleged that this monitoring of legitimate protest activities undermined the First Amendment's protection of political speech, and would chill valuable public debate about police violence, including use of deadly force, criminal justice, and racial inequities. 

On July 5 2016, the plaintiffs submitted their FOIA request to DHS and the FBI: 

<b>DHS</b>
On July 18, 2016, DHS's privacy office sent a letter to the plaintiffs acknowledging receipt of the request. DHS denied the plaintiffs' request for expedited processing and a fee waiver, which the plaintiffs appealed. On August 29, 2016, DHS acknowledged that it had received the appeal, but never responded to it. 

On September 27, 2016, the plaintiffs received a response from the Office of Intelligence & Analysis, a component of DHS, claiming that a search of its files revealed no records responsive to the plaintiffs' request. The plaintiffs appealed that decision based on the Office of Intelligence and Analysis' failure to perform an adequate search for records and its improper reliance on FOIA exemptions to avoid searching for, or producing, responsive records. On October 20, the plaintiffs received an acknowledgment from DHS regarding the appeal, but did not receive any other response or correspondence. 

<b>FBI</b>
On July 28, 2016, the FBI sent a letter acknowledging receipt of the plaintiffs' request. Unlike DHS, the FBI granted the plaintiffs' request for expedited processing, however, it did not indicate whether processing had begun or when it would be complete. On September 20, 2016, the plaintiffs sent the FBI a letter requesting that the FBI notify them of when to expect to receive documents responsive to their request, but the FBI never responded.

An initial pretrial conference was originally set for January 20, 2017, before U.S. District Court Judge William H. Pauley III. After several motions to push back the date of the initial pretrial conference, the conference was held on February 24, 2017. Another status conference was held on April 21, 2017. During this conference, the parties agreed to the discovery schedule of 500 pages per month of responsive documents. 

During discovery, both parties narrowed the requested documents, and prepared to file motions to contest or uphold exemptions. In line with timelines set in a February 9, 2018 scheduling conference, both parties filed motions for partial summary judgment surrounding release of a non-finalized intelligence assessment titled ""(U\\FOUO) Growing Frequency of Race-Related Domestic Terrorist Violence."" On July 9, 2018, Judge William Pauley ruled in favor of the defendants, saying that this document falls under FOIA's exemption 5 for process-related documents. He wrote that, because this document was written by an analyst and an intern, it revealed the processes of how DHS assesses and analyzes intelligence.

With this motion for summary judgment decided and the cooperation of the parties outside of the contested DHS memo, all issues in the case were settled outside of the allocation of attorney fees. With this in mind, after an August 7, 2018 status report, Judge Pauley filed an order to partially dismiss the case, closing all claims outside of attorney fees.

The case was briefly stayed in late 2018 and early 2019 due to the U.S. federal government shutdown. On March 12, 2019, Judge Pauley received a status report indicating that the parties reached a settlement on attorney fees. He ordered dismissal on April 11 and published the terms of the agreement; the FBI would pay $12,527.11, the Federal Emergency Management Administration (FEMA) would pay $1,742.81, the Cybersecurity Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) would pay $11,655.40, and DHS Intelligence and Analysis would pay $11,655.40 to the plaintiffs.

The case at hand involves a dispute over the release of documents under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), brought forth by the plaintiffs, the Center for Constitutional Rights and Color of Change, against the defendants, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants were withholding information under Exemption 5 of FOIA, which allows for the withholding of certain privileged materials. The plaintiffs argued that the defendants' broad interpretation of ""segregability"" could potentially allow for the withholding of any information deemed ""editorial judgments."" The defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment, which was granted by Judge William H. Pauley, III, with Magistrate Judge Sarah Netburn designated. The court ruled in favor of the defendants, stating that in certain situations, a factual narrative may reveal editorial judgments and therefore fall under the agency's privilege. However, the plaintiffs raised concerns about the defendants' Vaughn Declaration, which provides a detailed analysis of the withheld material. The parties reached a settlement and the case was dismissed, with the defendants agreeing to pay the plaintiffs' attorney's fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge William H.

Dowds alleged that she was subjected to sexual harassment by Law, including unwanted touching and sexual comments, and that she was subsequently fired in retaliation for her complaints. The EEOC sought relief for Dowds in the form of monetary compensation and a permanent injunction to prevent further discrimination and harassment. The EEOC was represented by Franci M.

EE-CO-0007,"In June 2006, the Phoenix District Office and Denver Field Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed this lawsuit against distribution center operators Albertson's, Inc., Albertson's LLC, Supervalu, Inc. and Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, alleging discrimination based on race, color, and/or national origin in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Specifically, the complaint alleged that the defendants maintained a hostile work environment and subjected the complaining parties to other adverse terms and conditions of employment.

The plaintiffs alleged long-term, continuing, and pervasive harassment and discrimination by supervisors and co-workers, including offensive and disparaging racial comments and graffiti, assignment of minorities to harder and less desirable duties, favoring of non-minorities in promotions, disciplining minorities more harshly, and Albertson’s failure to take appropriate, timely, and effective remedial action.

Supervalu, Inc. and Cerberus Capital Management, L.P. were dismissed from the lawsuit in October 2006. The parties engaged in discovery from 2006 through 2009. On December 3, 2007, the Court (Judge Wiley Y. Daniel) granted motions to allow four plaintiff intervenors to intervene, and the four plaintiff intervenors filed complaints that day. 

On April 28, 2008, the parties filed cross motions for summary judgment. The case was reassigned to Judge Christine M. Arguello on October 22, 2008. Proceedings were stayed beginning in February, 2009 pending negotiation and finalization of a consent decree. At the time the consent decree was developed, Albertsons had represented that it planned to close its Colorado distribution center in late fall 2009 for business reasons unrelated to the action.

On December 11, 2009, the parties made a joint motion to consolidate this lawsuit with two other EEOC proceedings involving the Aurora, Colorado Albertson's distribution center. Judge Arguello granted the motion on December 14, 2009, and entered the consent decree that day. The consent decree included provisions against retaliation, a neutral reference for complaining parties, an equal employment opportunity training for supervisory and management employees, and certain terms should Albertson's open or reopen a distribution center in Colorado during the time of the consent decree. The consent decree also provided that Albertson's pay $8,900,000.00 to a class settlement fund to be distributed as determined by the EEOC.

The consent decree remained in effect for four years, and the case is now closed.","

This case, ""Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Albertson's LLC,"" involves a lawsuit filed by the EEOC against Albertson's LLC, a distribution center in Aurora, Colorado, for discriminatory practices based on race, color, and national origin. The plaintiffs, a class of employees represented by the EEOC, alleged that they were subjected to a hostile work environment and unequal terms and conditions of employment. The defendant, represented by attorneys from their in-house legal department, was accused of failing to address the discrimination, in violation of their own harassment policy. The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a permanent injunction, compensation for past and future losses, punitive damages, and employee training on discriminatory harassment and retaliation. The case was brought before the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, with Magistrate Judge Boyd N. Boland handling various motions and hearings. After multiple hearings and orders, a final pretrial conference was held and a consent decree was reached, requiring the defendant to pay a settlement of $8.9 million to eligible class members, as well as implementing changes to their policies and procedures to prevent future discrimination. The case was ultimately resolved in favor of the plaintiffs, with the court entering a final verdict and the case being closed on December 11",0.6215,0.3292,0.4304,0.2535,0.134,0.1753,0.3318,0.1757,0.2298
PN-NY-0014,"This is one of four ongoing cases challenging the constitutionality of the New York Police Department's ""Stop and Frisk"" program.  See: Floyd v. City of New York (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">PN-NY-0009</a>); Daniels v. City of New York (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12023"">PN-NY-0010</a>); and Davis v. City of New York (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12494"">PN-NY-0013</a>).

On March 28, 2012, twelve New York City residents and one former New York City resident filed this suit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against the City of New York and the New York City Police Department (NYPD) on behalf of a class of similarly situated individuals.  They challenged the city's ""Operation Clean Halls"" initiative (later renamed the ""Trespass Affidavit Program""), which allowed police officers to patrol in and around private residential apartment buildings, and allegedly resulted in thousands of illegal stops, searches, summons (citations), and arrests.  The plaintiffs were represented by a group of public interest lawyers from the New York Civil Liberties Union, Bronx Defenders and LatinoJustice.  They filed the lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act and state law, alleging violations of the Federal and State Constitutions.  The plaintiffs asked for a declaration that the NYPD's practices were unlawful and an injunction against those practices.

Operation Clean Halls had the stated purpose of combating illegal activity in apartment buildings with records of high crime.  In Manhattan alone, there were at least 3,895 Clean Halls buildings. Searches and seizures occurred in public areas such as courtyards, lobbies, and sidewalks, and NYPD officers engaged in vertical patrols (floor-by-floor sweeps), much like those that were challenged in litigation surrounding New York City Housing Authority residences.  The plaintiffs alleged that they had been stopped without suspicion of unlawful behavior, and that they had been arrested or issued summons (citations) without probable cause.  In multiple instances, plaintiffs were arrested for trespassing despite having another resident vouch for them.  The plaintiffs alleged that these incidents were part of a larger pattern and practice in buildings enrolled in Operation Clean Halls, without meaningful correlations to actual crime levels.  The residents of Clean Hall buildings were disproportionately Black and Latino.  The plaintiffs also alleged that the City had been deliberately indifferent to these violations in their failure to train and supervise the NYPD.

The plaintiffs asked for a class certification for all residents of Clean Hall buildings and their families, guests, and visitors and for all individuals who had been or were likely to be unlawfully stopped or arrested for being in or around buildings in the Operation Clean Halls initiative.   The plaintiffs claimed violations of the Fourth Amendment; First and Fourteenth Amendments (free association and due process); the Fair Housing Act (discriminatory implementation); the New York Constitution; and New York Common Law (false arrest and malicious prosecution).  The plaintiffs asked for a declaration that these laws had been violated.  The plaintiffs also demanded an injunction that required the defendants to refrain from these violations, to establish citywide standards regarding Operation Clean Halls, to establish a system for tracking and monitoring NYPD practices (with care paid to tracking race, national origin, and geography), develop appropriate training for NYPD officers; and report to the plaintiffs and the court about the steps taken to cure the violations.  The plaintiffs also asked for compensatory damages and attorneys' fees and costs.

On June 12, 2012, the Court (Shira A. Scheindlin, J.) issued a memorandum opinion and order.  Ligon v. City of New York, 2012 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81526, 2012 WL 2125989 (S.D.N.Y. June 12, 2012).  The defendants wanted access to paperwork on the plaintiffs' prior arrests, even if they were terminated in the plaintiffs' favor and were now sealed pursuant to state law.  Judge Scheindlin ruled that there was no legitimate reason for the defendants to access those files unless they were for charges of trespass or related crimes in the past ten years.  The Court also ruled that the plaintiffs must make other disclosures about the length of time they were incarcerated and any injuries they suffered as a result of prior arrests, but that that could be done by sworn affidavit.

On August 21, 2012, Judge Scheindlin issued an opinion and order allowing the plaintiffs' evidentiary hearing to proceed, regarding their request for a preliminary injunction.  Ligon v. City of New York, 2012 WL 3597066 (S.D.N.Y. Aug. 21, 2012).  The defendants had asked the Court to deny the plaintiffs' motion summarily, prior to a hearing.  The defendants had argued (among other reasons) that there was overlap in the plaintiff classes between this case and <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">Floyd</a>, so there was a risk of inconsistent adjudications.  The Court pointed out that both matters were assigned to the same judge and gave the defendants a choice:  they could cease delaying <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">Floyd</a> with interlocutory appeals or they could agree to let these plaintiffs pursue preliminary injunctive relief. The Court wrote: ""the City cannot have it both ways."" This case went forward with the preliminary injunction proceedings. 

The preliminary injunction hearing took place in October and November 2012. On January 8, 2013, Judge Scheindlin ruled for the plaintiffs, finding that they had demonstrated the likelihood that they would prevail on the merits, and proved the city's deliberate indifference toward a widespread practice of unconstitutional trespass stops by the NYPD outside TAP buildings in the Bronx.  Judge Scheindlin summarized that her conclusion was based on five categories of evidence: 
(1) the testimony of a Bronx Assistant District Attorney that the NYPD frequently made trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx for no reason other than that the officer had seen someone enter and exit or exit the building; 
(2) a sample of ""decline to prosecute"" forms prepared by the Bronx District Attorneys' Office, which revealed the alarming frequency of unlawful trespass stops in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx; 
(3) the testimony of eight plaintiffs and a non-party witness, who described remarkably similar encounters with the police when stopped in the vicinity of TAP buildings in the Bronx; 
(4) the analysis by Dr. Jeffrey Fagan, plaintiffs' expert, of an NYPD database of recorded stops, which provided further evidence of the frequency of apparently unlawful trespass stops outside TAP buildings in the Bronx; and 
(5) NYPD training materials that misstated the minimal constitutional standards for making stops.  

The Court issued a preliminary injunction, ordering the NYPD to immediately cease performing trespass stops (in which a reasonable person would not feel free to terminate the encounter) outside TAP buildings in the Bronx without reasonable suspicion of trespass.  In addition, Judge Scheindlin set out proposed relief, and consolidated a hearing on it with the already-scheduled remedial hearing in the related <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">Floyd</a> litigation.  The proposed relief included requirements to develop constitutionally adequate policy guidance on stops, to collect data on each such stop, and to improve supervision and training.  Ligon v. City of New York, 2013 WL 71800 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 8, 2013).

On January 11, 2013, the defendants appealed the preliminary injunction decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals.  On January 22, 2013, District Judge Scheindlin granted the defendants' stay of relief, pending their appeal in the circuit court.  

On February 11, 2013, Judge Scheindlin granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification solely for the purpose of preliminary injunctive relief. The class included ""all individuals who have been or are at risk of being stopped outdoors without legal justification by NYPD officers on suspicion of trespassing in Bronx apartment buildings enrolled in the NYPD's Trespass Affidavit Program (commonly referred to as ""Operation Clean Halls""). Ligon v. City of New York, 2013 WL 500272 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 11, 2013).

After a nine-week bench trial, on August 12, 2013, Judge Scheindlin issued an order in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">Floyd</a>, finding that the City had violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments by acting with “deliberate indifference” toward the NYPD's practice of making suspicion-less “stops” and “frisks” and by adopting “a policy of indirect racial profiling by targeting racially defined groups” for “stops” and “frisks.” That same day, Judge Scheindlin issued an order imposing remedies in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">Floyd</a> and Ligon in the form of various “reforms” to the NYPD's “stop and frisk” practices to be overseen by a court-appointed monitor.  The Court appointed Peter Zimroth, former New York Corporation Counsel and former First Assistant District Attorney in Manhattan, to oversee the implementation of the relief.  With respect to specific remedies, the Court ordered the NYPD to adopt a written policy spelling out the specific circumstances where stopping a person suspected of trespass outside a TAP building is legal.  Additionally, the Court ordered the city (1) to develop procedures to ensure proper paperwork is completed for each stop outside a Bronx TAP building; (2) to develop and adopt a system for reviewing the legality of stops outside Bronx TAP buildings; and (3) to revise the NYPD's training materials and training programs to enter conformity with the law.  Additionally, the Court ordered that attorney's fees and costs be rewarded on appropriate application.  The City appealed in both cases and sought a stay.

In September 2013, four police unions filed notices of appeal and motions to intervene in the District Court. Three of the unions moved to intervene in both Floyd and Ligon.  One union only moved to intervene in Floyd.

On October 31, 2013, the Second Circuit granted the City’s motion for a stay and ordered that the cases be reassigned from Judge Scheindlin to another district judge.  The Second Circuit wrote that the ""District Judge ran afoul of the Code of Conduct for United States Judges"" in (a) speaking to the press and (b) encouraging the plaintiffs' counsel in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12023"">Daniels</a> to file the <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">Floyd</a> litigation, separately, rather than litigating racial profiling as part of <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12023"">Daniels</a> -- particularly in stating that she would treat the new case as related.  538 F. App'x 101 (2d Cir. 2013).

After the Second Circuit ruled, both <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">Floyd</a> and Ligon were reassigned (as related) to District Judge Analisa Torres.  On November 13, 2013, the Court of Appeals rejected Judge Scheindlin's motion asking to be heard on the disqualification issue and clarified the reason for reassigning the case. The Second Circuit held that the rationale for the reassignment was an appearance of impropriety, not its actual presence.  736 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2013). 

In the meantime, NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio was elected, and took a very different approach to these cases.  The city moved for limited remand from the Second Circuit to the district court for the purpose of exploring settlement.  On February 21, 2014, the Second Circuit granted the City’s motion to remand to the district court to explore settlement for 45 days. The Second Circuit declined to decide the police unions' motion to intervene, preferring to let the district court decide that motion first. 743 F.3d 362 (2d Cir. 2014).

On March 4, 2014, the parties informed Judge Torres that they had “reached an agreement in principle for resolving the City's appeals in both Floyd and Ligon. The City agreed to substantially comply with the injunctive relief set forth in Judge Scheindlin's August 12, 2013, remedial order, subject to the parties' application to Judge Torres to limit the term of the court-appointed monitor to three years. When the monitor’s term ended, the City agreed to authorize the Inspector General of the NYPD to take over monitoring and reporting responsibilities. The parties agreed that the agreement could be terminated once the City has maintained compliance for two years. On July 30, 2014, Judge Torres granted the parties' joint motion to modify the remedial order and to enter it as an embodiment of their agreements.

On July 30, 2014, Judge Torres also issued an order denying the police unions' motions to intervene, finding, inter alia, that the motions were untimely and that the police unions did not assert a legally protectable interest. 302 F.R.D. 69 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).  The police unions appealed.

However, on August 6, 2014, with the consent of the plaintiffs in Floyd and Ligon, the City moved to voluntarily dismiss its remaining appeals, with prejudice, stating that the parties had reached an agreement that resolved all the issues raised by the City's appeals in both Floyd and Ligon, and cleared the way for the parties to begin the remedial process and settlement negotiations.

On October 31, 2014, the Second Circuit granted the City’s request to voluntarily dismiss all appeals, with prejudice.  In addition, the Second Circuit held that the unions’ motions to intervene were untimely and that the unions failed to establish legally protectable interests, as required to allow intervention.  770 F.3d 1051 (2d Cir. 2014). 

The parties continued to work with the monitor on developing appropriate reforms.  On February 3, 2015, Judge Torres issued an order regarding the procedure for the monitor to develop and the City to implement the reforms of NYPD’s stop-and-frisk activities.  The monitor would consult with the parties to create a final recommendations for the implementation of remedies.  Then, the court would approve or deny the final recommendations. 

First, on February 23, 2015, the monitor submitted and Judge Torres approved, a memo that was read by the NYPD at 10 consecutive roll calls in all precincts detailing the reforms ordered by Judge Scheindlin in Floyd. The memo was also posted in police stations and provided to all officers. The document detailed the constitutional standards governing stop and frisks, explicitly prohibited racial profiling by police, ordered officers to include a narrative explanation for stops in their UF250 forms, and ordered the start of a pilot program outfitting police officers with body cameras.

Meanwhile, on March 18, 2015, the City suggested a way for all five police unions to participate in the remedial process. Under the City's approach, the City would share proposals with the unions before providing them to the monitor and the plaintiffs. The unions could then offer their comments, which the City would convey to the monitor. This approach would afford the unions an opportunity to inform the monitor of their viewpoints before the monitor reached conclusions and submitted the final recommendations to the Court. On March 19, 2015, Judge Torres issued an order approving this framework.

On August 7, 2015, the monitor submitted his final recommendations for reforms on racial profiling and street encounters.  The new racial profiling policy imposed a categorical prohibition on racial and national origin profiling; it also prohibited other forms of biased policing not covered in the NYPD’s current policy, such as profiling on the basis of religion, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, and housing status.  The new street encounters policy regarding placed clearer legal limits on stops and frisks. It required supervisory review of officer conduct to ensure compliance with the Constitution.  On August 24, 2015, Judge Torres approved the final recommendations. 

On December 8, 2015, Judge Torres issued an order modifying the remedial order’s requirement that NYPD institute a pilot project in which body-worn cameras would be used for a one-year period.  Judge Torres modified the order so that the NYPD would use a randomized experimental design for the body-worn camera pilot program. 

By February 2017, the parties had a settlement agreement and began the formal process for court approval of a class-action settlement. Judge Torres approved the stipulation of settlement on July 19, 2017. The settlement includes payment to the named plaintiffs totaling $235,000 and attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses totaling $2,640,533. The stipulation also articulates specific standards for stopping, frisking, searching, arresting, and issuing summonses in and around TAP buildings and requires the NYPD to implement and consistently adhere to those standards. In addition to the specific reforms outlined in the settlement, it provides that further reforms will be developed as part of the remedial process described in the August 2013 Floyd/Ligon joint remedial order.

While the settlement of the claims in this case was being negotiated, the joint remedial process, part of the 2013 remedial order, included a comprehensive input process regarding recommended reforms. The input process concluded in April 2017, and in January 2018 the plaintiffs, describing the parties' impasse regarding the remedial process, requested that the facilitator issue a report and the parties hold a status conference. In an order of January 29, 2018, Judge Torres provided a schedule for the parties to work with the facilitator regarding reforms under the joint remedial process. Monitoring is ongoing in this case; see Floyd (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">PN-NY-0009</a>) for the implementation and monitoring proceedings of the settlement agreements.

In February of 2018, the monitor filed proposed training materials for newly promoted lieutenants and sergeants.  The materials involved guidebooks and powerpoint presentations that would be used during a four week training course (for lieutenants) and a six week training course (for sergeants).  The next month, Judge Torres approved the materials.  In June 2018, the monitor filed additional training materials regarding In-Service Stop and Frisks by Patrol Officers, which were approved by Judge Torres the next month.  

On July 19, 2018, Judge Torres issued an order about the recommendation to document police-citizen encounters.  The order stated that by September 13, 2018, the parties must submit a joint proposal for a pilot program to study the electronic recording of first- and second-level police-citizen encounters, to be overseen by the monitor. The proposal shall consider social science best practices. In developing the proposal, the parties shall consult with experts and the monitor.  The monitor shall report to the Court whether the benefits of recording lower-level encounters outweigh the financial, administrative, and other costs, and whether the program should be expanded or terminated.

On July 27, 2018, the monitor filed a report on the use of body cameras by NYPD officers that outlines how the data from the pilot program will be used to analyze police/civilian interactions, police activity, and police lawfulness.  

On August 13, 2018, Judge Torres approved a stipulation of fees for the time period of July 1, 2016 through December 31, 2017.  The City agreed to pay fees of $275,149.00 to the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation. 

In December of 2018, the monitor issued a report recommending the Internal Affairs Bureau (IAB) Guide on Processing and Investigating Complaints of Profiling and Bias-Based Policing Patrol, and two Internal Investigations courses on profiling and police bias as training materials.  Judge Torres granted these recommendations in January 2019.

On May 9, 2019, Judge Torres approved a stipulation of fees for the time period of January 1, 2018 through December 31, 2018.  The City agreed to pay fees of $85,352.00 to the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation. 

On May 28, 2019, the monitor made a recommendation regarding training materials for Housing Bureau members, including housing one-day training scenarios on lobby trespass, stairwell trespass, shots fired interior patrol, and roof trespass, which the Judge granted the next day.

Judge Torres approved a proposed confidentiality order regarding the pilot study, which severely restricted public access to data collected on police encounters with civilians.  The confidentiality order will protect the information that is obtained and created by trained observers studying officer behavior in the NYPD pilot study from disclosure to anyone other than the monitor and his team.  In the related <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12021"">Floyd</a> case, the plaintiffs moved for reconsideration of the confidentiality order, and Judge Torres denied this motion on October 25, 2019.  Floyd v. City of New York, 2019 WL 5537875 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 25, 2019).

On June 2, 2020, Judge Torres issued an order instructing the NYPD to systematically obtain and report various categories of information.  This information included declinations of prosecutions by district attorneys in New York, suppression decisions by courts excluding evidence as a result of unlawful stops and searches, court findings of incredible testimony by police officers, denials of indemnification and/or representation of police officers by the New York City Law Department, and judgments and settlements against police officers in civil cases where, in the opinion of the New York City Law Department, there exists evidence of police malfeasance.  This information will be compiled regularly by the NYPD and sent to a committee, who will review the information and make assessments of individual officers, as well as the extent and manner of the intervention to be applied.  This committee will also track metrics to evaluate the efficacy of the program.  The committee, in conjunction with the monitor, will also develop a program for receiving and assessing information regarding adverse conduct of police officers, and this information will be provided to the Police Commissioner.

In light of the COVID-19 pandemic, on June 2, 2020 the plaintiffs filed a motion to compel the defendants to produce information about the NYPD's use of investigative encounters and social distancing enforcement practices.  The city has filed its opposition brief in response to this motion, and the monitor filed a letter opposing the plaintiffs' motion.  On June 12, Judge Torres denied the plaintiffs' motion.

This case is ongoing. ","

The document at hand is a comprehensive compilation of individual summaries from the legal case of Floyd, et al. v. City of New York, et al., which centers around the New York City Police Department's (NYPD) stop-and-frisk tactics. The plaintiffs, including David Floyd, Kieron Johnson, Letitia Ledan, Abdullah Turner, Jacqueline Yates, Roshea Johnson, A.O., Fawn Bracy, Jaenean Ligon, Charles Bradley, Fernando Moronta, and Jovan Jefferson, along with a class of similarly situated individuals, have filed a lawsuit against the defendants, the City of New York, former NYPD Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly, former Mayor Michael Bloomberg, and other individuals. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the Center for Constitutional Rights, Legal Aid Society, and Shearman & Sterling LLP, allege that the NYPD's policies disproportionately target people of color and violate their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. They seek declaratory and injunctive relief, asking the court to declare the NYPD's practices unconstitutional and to order reforms to end discriminatory practices. On the other hand, the defense, represented by attorneys from the city's law department, including Celeste Koeleveld, argues that the NYPD's practices are justified and do not",0.7188,0.0374,0.0712,0.3089,0.016,0.0305,0.4531,0.0236,0.0449
NS-CA-0008,"On February 28, 2006, Al-Haramain Oregon (a non-profit organization) and two of its attorneys filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, 50 U.S.C. §§ 1801-1812 against the U.S. Government. The plaintiffs asked the court for injunctive relief and damages, claiming that the government violated FISA by conducting warrantless electronic surveillance of their communications. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the government's actions violated the separation of powers, the First Amendment, the Fourth Amendment, the Sixth Amendment, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. 

On September 7, 2006, Judge Garr M. King denied the government's motion to dismiss but granted its motion to prevent access to a sealed classified document that had been inadvertently released to plaintiffs. Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Bush, 451 F. Supp. 2d 1215 (D. Or. 2006). The plaintiffs appealed. 

In January, 2007, the Multi District Litigation (MDL) Panel transferred the case to the Northern District of California, as part of a multi-district litigation consolidation, In Re National Security Agency Telecommunications Records Litigation,  <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=13881"">NS-CA-11</a>, in this Clearinghouse. On April 30, 2007, the Ninth Circuit officially consolidated the plaintiffs' appeal with with Hepting v. AT & T, <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12825"">NS-CA-0004</a>, in this Clearinghouse. However, on November 16, 2007, the Ninth Circuit severed the two cases from each other and ordered that the cases would no longer be consolidated for any purpose. Hepting v. AT & T, 508 F.3d 898, 899 (9th Cir. 2007). 

On November 16, 2007, the Ninth Circuit issued a second opinion specifically addressing the appeal from this case, reversing and remanding the district court's order. Judge McKeown held that (1) state secrets privilege did not protect the subject matter of the plaintiffs' challenge; but (2) that privilege protected the sealed document the plaintiffs relied on; (3) the district court should not have permitted in camera review of affidavits attesting to the plaintiffs' attorneys' memories of the document; and (4) the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge without the sealed document. Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Bush, 507 F.3d 1190 (9th Cir. 2007).

Meanwhile, in January, 2007, the case was transferred to the Northern District of California, as part of a multi-district litigation consolidation.  On July 2, 2008, Judge Vaughn Walker of the Northern District of California held that FISA preempted the state secrets privilege with respect to foreign telecommunications surveillance. Judge Walker also held that the plaintiffs could not use a sealed classified document to establish their status as ""aggrieved persons"" within the meaning of FISA, but he also granted them leave to amend the complaint, which the plaintiffs did. In re Nat'l Sec. Agency Telecommunications Records Litig., 564 F. Supp. 2d 1109 (N.D. Cal. 2008).

On January 5, 2009, Judge Walker denied government motions to dismiss the plaintiffs' claims. In re Nat'l Sec. Agency Telecommunications Records Litig., 595 F. Supp. 2d 1077 (N.D. Cal. 2009).  

On May 22, 2009, Judge Walker denied the government's third motion to dismiss and granted the plaintiffs' motion for discovery pursuant to 50 U.S.C. § 1806(f). The order provided for plaintiffs' counsel to obtain top secret/sensitive compartmented information security clearances and ordered the government to review its classified submissions in this case and determine whether any could be declassified. In re Nat'l Sec. Agency Telecommunications Records Litig., MDL. 06-1791VRW, 2009 WL 1468792 (N.D. Cal. May 22, 2009).

On March 31, 2010, Judge Walker ordered entry of a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Judge Walker held that (1) the private remedy provision of FISA implicitly waived the government's sovereign immunity; (2) the prior mandate did not preclude plaintiffs from attempting to establish standing under FISA; (3) the defendants were equitably estopped from arguing that a valid FISA warrant existed; (4) the defendants violated FISA; and (5) the FBI director was not liable in his official capacity. In re Nat'l Sec. Agency Telecommunications Records Litig., 700 F. Supp. 2d 1182 (N.D. Cal. 2010). On December 22, 2010, Judge Walker awarded the plaintiffs about $2.5 million in attorneys' fees and about $41,000 to two of the three plaintiffs in liquidated damages. The defendants appealed. 

On December 5, 2012, the Ninth Circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated the judgment in favor of the plaintiffs. Writing for the Ninth Circuit, Judge McKeown held that (1) the government did not waive sovereign immunity under the civil liability provision of FISA, reversing the district court's order, and (2) the FBI director was not liable, affirming the district court's order. As a result, the Ninth Circuit dismissed all of the claims, ending the case. Al-Haramain Islamic Found., Inc. v. Obama, 705 F.3d 845 (9th Cir. 2012). This opinion amended and superseded the opinion from August 7, 2012, 690 F.3d 1089, which is almost identical to the amended opinion. The amended opinion simply omits a more detailed explanation of the procedures Congress required for certain sections of FISA (Section 2712(b)) where there was a waiver of sovereign immunity.","

The document collection in question pertains to a civil case, 3:06-cv-00274-KI, filed in the US District Court for the District of Oregon in 2006. The plaintiffs, Steven Goldberg and Al-Haramain Islamic Foundation, Inc., brought forth a lawsuit against defendants George W. Bush, the National Security Agency, Keith B. Alexander, Office of Foreign Assets Control, Robert W. Werner, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Robert S. Mueller, III. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants engaged in unlawful surveillance of their communications without proper authorization, violating their civil rights. They sought $2,560,000 in damages from the defendants. The case was assigned to Judge Garr M. King and later transferred to Judge Vaughn R Walker in the US District Court for the Northern District of California.

The plaintiffs were represented by a team of attorneys, including Jon B. Eisenberg, Lisa Robin Jaskol, Thomas Howard Nelson, Zaha S Hassan, Jessica Ashlee Albies, and Steven Goldberg. On the other side, the defendants were represented by attorneys from the US Department of Justice. The court issued a scheduling order for a telephone conference to discuss recent submissions by the parties. The defendants then filed a motion to dismiss or for",0.615,0.139,0.2267,0.2261,0.0509,0.0831,0.345,0.078,0.1272
PC-GA-0017,"The plaintiff in this case is a transgender female. She was denied medically necessary healthcare and suffered repeated sexual assault and harassment throughout her incarceration. The plaintiff suffered from gender dysphoria and—despite her feminine appearance—the defendant assigned her to a maximum-security male prison. In these facilities, transgender inmates often face the highest risk of sexual violence. 

The plaintiff brought this action in the Middle District of Georgia on February 19, 2015 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the defendant staff at the Georgia Department of Corrections, Rutledge State Prison, and Valdosta State prison. The plaintiff claimed deliberate indifference to her medical needs in denying medically necessary treatment for gender dysphoria, violations of her Eighth Amendment right against cruel and unusual punishment, failure of guards to protect her from serious sexual assault, and failure to train prison personnel regarding transgender inmates' health and safety. Represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and private counsel, the plaintiff requested declaratory relief, compensatory and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees, and a preliminary and permanent injunction requiring the Georgia Department of Corrections to adhere to professional standards of care in treating inmates that suffer from gender dysphoria. 

The plaintiff was first imprisoned in 2012. Within the first month of her imprisonment, the plaintiff was sexually assaulted by six gang members. The plaintiff was sexually assaulted by other inmates more than half a dozen times throughout her three-year incarceration. The defendants also denied her medically necessary hormone treatment. But the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for the plaintiff's failure to exhaust administrative remedies and failure to state a claim. They also asserted qualified immunity defenses. 

In the meantime, the court denied the plaintiff’s motion for a temporary restraining order, on April 20, 2015. At this hearing, the court put consideration of her preliminary injunction on hold to investigate new policies that the Georgia Department of Corrections had implemented since the beginning of the suit. 131 F. Supp. 3d 1353. 

Less than five months later, the plaintiff was released from prison. She was only three years into an eight year sentence on August 31, 2015. The court then ruled on the defendants' various motions to dismiss on September 14, 2015. First, the plaintiff's claims for injunctive and declaratory relief were mooted and dismissed without prejudice as a result of her release from prison. The court denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the plaintiff's deliberate indifference to a serious medical need claim and failure-to-protect claim because the plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies. Further, the court held that defendant prison personnel were not entitled to qualified immunity on the plaintiff's deliberate indifference to a serious medical need claim and that the defendant medical director was not entitled to qualified immunity on the failure-to-protect claim. Finally, the court held that the plaintiff sufficiently pleaded that defendant medical director failed to train subordinates regarding the safety of transgender inmates and that this failure resulted in deliberate indifference to Diamond’s constitutional right to reasonable protection—the defendant medical director was not entitled to qualified immunity on this claim.  

The parties reached an undisclosed monetary settlement and filed a stipulated dismissal on February 11, 2016. 

As a result of the lawsuit, the Georgia Department of Corrections no longer uses the “freeze frame” policy that prohibited transgender inmates from receiving treatment or updating treatment plans as needed. Many transgender inmates in Georgia now receive hormone therapy. Moreover, the defendants have adopted a sexual assault prevention policy that adheres to federal standards. These prevention policies are supplemented by training programs for prison staffers that address the unique needs of transgender inmates. The case is now closed. ","

This case, numbered 5:15-cv-50, involves a lawsuit filed by Ashley A Diamond, a transgender inmate, against various defendants in the Georgia Department of Corrections (GDC). The plaintiff alleges that the defendants, including GDC officials and medical personnel, violated her constitutional rights by denying her necessary medical care for her gender dysphoria. Ms. Diamond had been receiving hormone therapy for her condition for over 17 years before her incarceration, but upon entering GDC's custody, she was abruptly denied this treatment. She was also repeatedly sexually assaulted while in custody, and her requests for transfer to a safer facility and for proper medical treatment were ignored. The plaintiff seeks injunctive and declaratory relief, as well as damages. The court ultimately rules in favor of Ms. Diamond, finding that the defendants' deliberate indifference towards her medical needs and safety violated the Eighth Amendment. The case also involves the United States Department of Justice filing a statement of interest in support of Ms. Diamond's claims. The plaintiff is represented by attorneys from the Southern Poverty Law Center and the National Center for Lesbian Rights. The court proceedings include various motions and hearings, with the court ultimately granting a preliminary injunction for Ms. Diamond to receive necessary medical care and be protected from harm.",0.7009,0.2431,0.361,0.2394,0.0828,0.123,0.3037,0.1053,0.1564
IM-FL-0028,"On December 3, 2018, a U.S. citizen detainee filed this lawsuit under § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida to challenge his unlawful arrest and detention by the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. The plaintiff alleged that the Sheriff's Office carelessly and aggressively arrested him for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) under a Basic Ordering Agreement (BOA) between the two agencies, in violation of his Fourth Amendment rights and his right to be free from false imprisonment under Florida law. The BOA scheme provided the Sheriff with $50 per arrest for detaining individuals arrested for ICE. The plaintiff claimed that despite his repeated protests to multiple jail officers and his offer to produce proof of his U.S. citizenship, the Sheriff’s Office held him so that ICE could deport him to Jamaica. The plaintiff would have been deported to Jamaica but-for a last-minute intervention in which a friend sent a copy of the plaintiff's birth certificate to an ICE agent. The plaintiff sought declaratory and compensatory damages, as well as attorney’s fees. Chief Judge K. Michael Moore was assigned to the case, but was reassigned to Judge Kathleen M. Williams.

On February 11, 2019, Judge Williams set a jury trial on February 3, 2020. In the meantime, the parties engaged in negotiations with a mediator. Ultimately, the parties failed to reach a settlement agreement. The trial date was reset for July 20, 2020, and discovery continued.

On February 18, 2020, both the plaintiff and defendants filed for summary judgment. The case was stayed for a few months in mid-2020, in part due to interruptions caused by COVID-19. In the ensuing months, the parties jointly asked for multiple stays for trial proceedings. 

Currently, the parties are supposed to file their motions in limine by May 17, 2021 and their pretrial stipulation and deposition designations by June 7, 2021. The case remains ongoing.","

This document, Brown v. Ramsay, is a collection of various court orders and notices related to a civil rights lawsuit filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in December 2018. The plaintiff, Peter Sean Brown, a U.S. citizen and resident of Monroe County, is represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the Southern Poverty Law Center, and Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher LLP. The defendant in the case is Sheriff Richard A. “Rick” Ramsay of the Monroe County Sheriff's Office. The lawsuit alleges that Brown was wrongfully held in jail for several weeks due to an immigration detainer request from Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), despite repeatedly asserting his citizenship and providing evidence. The plaintiff's attorneys are seeking compensatory damages for the violation of Brown's Fourth Amendment rights and false imprisonment. The court has issued various orders, including a referral order to a Magistrate Judge, a paperless pretrial order, and a transcript of a discovery hearing. The court also granted several motions for attorneys to appear pro hac vice. The plaintiff has filed a motion to continue the trial date, which was granted by the court.

IM-NY-0053,"This class action, filed Jan. 28, 2017, challenged President Trump’s Jan. 27, 2017 Executive Order (EO) ban on admission to the U.S. of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen. It was filed as a petition for a writ of habeas corpus (to seek immediate release of plaintiffs from detention) and a civil complaint, on behalf of two individuals and the class of ""all individuals with refugee applications approved by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services as part of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program, holders of valid immigrant and non-immigrant visas, and other individuals from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Sudan, Libya, Somalia, and Yemen legally authorized to enter the United States, but who have been or will be denied entry to the United States on the basis of the January 27, 2017 Executive Order."" Counsel for plaintiffs were the American Civil Liberties Union, the International Refugee Assistance Project at the Urban Justice Center, the National Immigration Law Center, Yale Law School’s Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization and the firm Kilpatrick Townsend & Stockton. They filed the case in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York, along with a motion for class certification; it was initially assigned to Obama appointee Judge Ann Donnelly, who was on duty for any emergencies that weekend.

The lead plaintiffs were detained at JFK Airport by U.S. Customs and Border Protection and threatened with deportation even though they had valid visas to enter the United States. One plaintiff, Hameed Darweesh, had worked for the U.S. military in Iraq; his life was in danger in Iraq due to that relationship. The other plaintiff’s wife and son were threatened because of their perceived ties to the United States. The complaint argued that their continued detention based solely on the EO violated their Fifth Amendment procedural and substantive due process rights, and exceeded the government's authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act. The EO's singling out of seven majority-Muslim nations for disfavored treatment unconstitutionally discriminated against Muslims, it said.

At 7:30 pm the day the matter was filed, Judge Donnelly heard an emergency motion to stay all removals (that is, deportations) under the order; after a hearing, she granted a nationwide stay of removals to all members of the class. At the hearing, Judge Donnelly further required the defendants to provide a list of all individuals detained as a result of the EO. 

The next day, on Jan. 29, 2017, plaintiffs filed a motion asking the Court to ""immediately clarify that its Jan. 28th Order is nationwide and order Respondents to enforce the stay of removal."" They explained that they had received information that members of the class were continuing to be deported, in other states.  Later that day, the plaintiffs filed a ""notice"" that said that the U.S. had ""acknowledge[d] that the Order does in fact apply nationwide.""  The notice explained, ""Petitioners continue to monitor reports of noncompliance and are working with Respondents’ counsel to attempt to resolve them. Petitioners will update the Court as to any issues of noncompliance should further clarification or enforcement be necessary.""  

In addition, on Jan. 29,  2017, a member of the class filed an emergency motion with the court seeking declaratory relief to clarify that she will not be detained or deported. The class member is an Iranian national and lawful permanent resident of the U.S. with a visa. Her husband, a U.S. citizen, sponsored her for permanent residence in the U.S. 

The initial assignment had been for emergency purposes over the weekend; on Monday, Jan. 30,  2017, the case was randomly reassigned to Judge Carol Bagley Amon.  

On Feb. 2, J 2017, udge Amon extended the TRO to Feb. 21, 2017 for good cause shown. In addition, the New York State Office of the Attorney General filed a Motion to Intervene, which was granted on Feb. 10. 

On Feb. 6,  2017, the government filed a notice of supplemental authority which noted the Feb. 3 letter written by the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Visa Services at the Department of State. This Feb. 3 letter reversed the provisional revocation of all visas previously issued by the Deputy Assistant Secretary.

On Feb. 7,  2017, the petitioners moved for the court to enforce its Jan. 28, 2017 order. The Jan. 28, 2017 order had directed the government to provide the plaintiffs' counsel with a list of all individuals detained pursuant to President Trump's Jan. 27, 2017 EO, including individuals previously released or removed.

On Feb. 8,  2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' petition and complaint for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. The defendants' motion also opposed the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. 

Additionally, the court issued a Feb. 8 2017,  order instructing the parties to submit memos and a briefing schedule in preparation for a hearing originally scheduled on Feb. 24. After the parties requested an expedited hearing on the stay motion and the motion to dismiss, because the government would not consent to an extension of the stay beyond Feb. 21, the court agreed to hold a hearing on Feb. 21, 2017. 

From Feb. 13-16,  2017, numerous organizations filed amicus briefs, including the Harvard Immigration and Refugee Clinical Program, the Fred T. Korematsu Center for Law and Equality, several members of Congress (represented by the Constitutional Accountability Center), the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, seventeen universities (Brown, Carnegie Mellon, Columbia, Cornell, Dartmouth, Duke, Emory, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, Northwestern, Princeton, Stanford, University of Chicago, University of Pennsylvania, Vanderbilt, and Yale), and many others. On Feb. 16,  2017, 167 members of Congress filed an amicus brief arguing, among other things, that the EO is irreconcilable with Congress's clearly expressed intent in the Immigration and Nationality Act.

On Feb. 16,  2017, the plaintiffs filed a response in opposition to the government's motion to dismiss the preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs argued that though the named plaintiffs had been admitted to the U.S., the case was not moot because: 1) the relief that the named plaintiffs received represented only a voluntary cessation of the challenged policy; 2) the case's class claims were inherently transitory; and 3) there were still individuals who, pursuant to the EO, had been unconstitutionally denied entry or admission into the US. 

In the meantime, in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15606""><i>Washington v. Trump</i></a>, in the Western District of Washington and then the Ninth Circuit, the EO had also been enjoined, and a stay of proceedings denied on Feb. 9 2017, ; on Feb. 16, 2017, the Trump administration announced that rather than continuing to litigate the EO's lawfulness, it would rescind the order and soon replace it with a revised version. 

The parties in this case therefore jointly requested on Feb. 17,  2017, that the court stay proceedings related to the petitioners' motion for a preliminary injunction and the government's motion to dismiss. The parties also requested that the court cancel the Feb. 21,  2017, hearing that was to be set on these motions. The court granted the parties' joint motion, and further determined that the injunction issued in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15606""><i>Washington v. Trump</i></a> provided sufficient protection so as to not require that the Jan. 28,  2017 injunction be extended beyond Feb. 21 2017. However, should the Washington injunction be vacated while the EO was in effect, the Jan. 28, 2017, injunction would be reinstated and the court would schedule a prompt hearing on whether the Jan. 28 2017 injunction should be extended further. 

The plaintiffs then on Feb. 20, 2017, filed a reply in support of their Feb. 7,  2017, motion for the court to enforce its Jan. 28, 2017, order directing the government to provide the plaintiffs' counsel with a list of all individuals detained pursuant to the EO. In the reply, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants should release the names of ""all individuals excluded on the basis of the EO"" after this action was filed, and not just those individuals which the plaintiff's counsel identified.

Judge Amon on Feb. 21, 2017, granted the plaintiffs' Feb. 7, 2017 motion in part. She read Judge Donnelly's Jan. 28, 2017, order as requiring defendants ""to provide a single list of putative class members being held pursuant to the EO at any time from the signing of the order and for a reasonable period thereafter, which would include through the following day."" Judge Amon also interpreted Judge Donnelly's use of ""the term 'detained' ""to be in the everyday sense, meaning those being held for questioning pursuant to the terms of the EO, as distinguished from individuals formally placed in removal proceedings."" The plaintiffs in this case specifically, noted Judge Amon, were not placed in removal proceedings but were nonetheless ""detained."" Accordingly, Judge Amon ordered defendants by Feb. 23, 2017, to provide plaintiffs with a list of all individuals with approved refugee applications, valid immigrant and nonimmigrant visas, or other legal authorization to enter the United States, from the seven banned countries, who were held, including being processed, by CBP pursuant to the EO from Jan. 28, 2017, at 9:37pm (when Judge Donnelly ordered defendants to produce the list) through Jan. 29, 2017, at 11:59pm.

The government filed two status reports on Feb. 23, 2017. The first status report informed the court that the government had prepared the list as ordered by Judge Amon on Feb. 21 (""putative class members being held pursuant to the EO at any time from the signing of the order and for a reasonable period thereafter""), and that the parties were working through the last-minute terms of the protective order. The second status report informed the court that the parties had agreed to a protective order covering the list containing the names of all individuals processed at any time from 9:27 PM on Jan. 28 to 11:59 PM on Jan. 29 pursuant to the Jan. 27 EO, including those previously released or removed, and that the government had provided the list to the petitioners. The petitioners reserved the right to challenge the government's designation of any information in the list for being overbroad. 

That same day, the parties filed a joint motion for an order protecting the confidentiality of the individuals named in the list, which the court granted. 

The parties appeared for oral argument on Feb. 24, 2017, before Judge Amon. During oral argument, the government stated that they would inform the petitioners as to which individuals on the Feb. 23, 2017, list were ultimately admitted into the U.S. The petitioners stated that they would provide the government with the names of individuals who they believed were not included on the list, but who should have been, so that the government may investigate accordingly. 

Also during oral argument on Feb. 24, 2017, the parties requested to adjourn the present briefing schedule regarding a potential motion to dismiss the Intervenor Plaintiff, the New York State Office of the Attorney General. The request was granted and the parties agreed to submit a new briefing schedule, if necessary, within seven days after a new EO is issued. 

Many religious organizations filed an appearance on Feb. 27 2017.

On Mar. 6, 2017, the President rescinded the Jan. 27 EO and replaced it with a narrower one, <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/09/2017-04837/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states"">Executive Order 13780</a>. On the same day, defendants filed a notice about the release of this new EO to take effect on Mar. 16, revoking and replacing the previous one. Defendants argued that the new EO differed substantially from the previous one and thus would not be affected by Judge Amon's TRO. Specifically, defendants noted that the new EO did not ban Iraqi nationals. Defendants stated that they would, as previously agreed, file a proposed joint scheduling order by Mar. 13.

Following this, the New York State Attorney General sent a Mar. 9, 2017, letter to the court, specifying that in light of the new EO, the AG would not pursue the case and would not file its proposed Feb. 2 Complaint in Intervention.

On Mar. 13, 2017, the parties then submitted a letter to Judge Amon, indicating that they were in settlement discussions and requesting a stay. Judge Amon granted such stays repeatedly for two and three weeks at a time.

On May 1, 2017, both plaintiff and defendants wrote separately to Judge Amon, informing her that the parties were unable to reach a settlement. After several conferences in May, the court re-scheduled the follow-up conference several times, as defendants twice requested an adjournment. (Judge Amon on May 31 mentioned that ""[t]he Court is not pleased with respondents' request."") Conferences, follow-ups, and extensions continued over the next few months. In the meantime, Judge Amon on Aug. 15 stayed sua sponte a ruling on plaintiff's Jan. 28 class certification motion, while settlement discussions proceeded.

Judge Amon held a settlement conference on Aug. 28, 2017, and a follow-up telephone conference the next day. The parties stated that they had reached a settlement in principle. Judge Amon asked them to confirm the details in the next settlement conference on Aug. 31, 2017. They did so, and entered the terms of the settlement agreement on the record. The parties then on Sept. 1, 2017, filed the settlement agreement and stipulation of dismissal.

According to the settlement agreement, defendants would within 14 days notify all persons barred from entering the U.S. under the Jan. 27 EO, and who were still outside the U.S., that they could re-apply for a visa. The letter would include a list of free legal services providers. The parties agreed that no applicants would be automatically entitled to a visa just by re-applying. After completing this notification, defendants would notify plaintiffs of their compliance, and plaintiffs would then file a stipulated dismissal of all claims, relief, damages, and jurisdiction for this matter.

The docket reflects that the court closed this case on Sept. 21, 2017.

The document, titled ""Comprehensive Summary of Case 17-cv-00480-CBA: Darweesh et al. v. Trump et al.,"" provides a detailed overview of a class action lawsuit filed in the Eastern District of New York. The plaintiffs, Hameed Khalid Darweesh and Haider Sameer Abdulkhaleq Alshawi, are Iraqi nationals who were detained and denied entry to the United States by Customs and Border Protection officials in response to an Executive Order signed by President Donald Trump on January 27, 2017. Represented by a team of attorneys from various organizations, the plaintiffs argue that their detention and denial of entry violates their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection, as well as immigration laws and international treaties. They seek relief in the form of a writ of habeas corpus and declaratory and injunctive relief to challenge the Executive Order. The court granted a temporary restraining order and injunction, enjoining the government from removing individuals affected by the Executive Order, and ordered the government to provide a list of individuals who were detained or denied entry. The attorneys involved in this case include lawyers from the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center, and the case has drawn significant attention and support.

The DOJ sought injunctive relief, alleging that the defendant violated Title VII by discriminating against a black employee in the City of Dallas Police Department.

Specifically, the DOJ alleged that because of his race, Black, and in retaliation against him for previously filing charges of discrimination with the EEOC and raising an internal grievance alleging race discrimination in the City of Dallas Police Department, he was subjected to adverse personnel actions, suspended for two days, and denied a promotion to the rank of sergeant.

The case at hand, United States v. City of Dallas, was filed on October 19, 1999 by the plaintiff, USA, against the defendant, City of Dallas. The lawsuit alleges that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by retaliating against their employee, Lee A. Bush, for opposing practices he believed to be unlawful. It is claimed that the defendant denied Bush a promotion and failed to take appropriate action to address the retaliation. As a result, Bush filed two charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, who found reason to believe that Title VII violations had occurred. The case was subsequently referred to the Department of Justice and the United States is seeking relief from the Court. The plaintiff is seeking remedial measures to compensate for the harm suffered by Bush, as well as compensatory damages and any other relief deemed just by the court. The plaintiff also requested a jury trial for eligible issues. The defendant, represented by Melissa M Fletcher Godwin Pappas Langley Ronquillo, filed a motion to transfer the case for possible consolidation, which was ultimately granted.

Hurd). The plaintiff, represented by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the New York Civil Liberties Union, alleged denial of equal protection on the basis of sex and sexual orientation in violation of the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983; discrimination based on sex and sexual orientation and negligent supervision under New York state law; and sex discrimination in violation of Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, 20 U.S.C. § 1681 et seq. Based on these claims, the plaintiff requested a declaratory judgment, preliminary and permanent injunctive relief, attorneys' fees and costs, and compensatory, punitive, and statutory damages.

The plaintiff claimed that from 2007 to 2009, he suffered physical and emotional harms due to the defendant's deliberate indifference to a pattern of severe, persistent, and violent harassment of the plaintiff at the hands of fellow students based on his sex and sexual orientation. These physical and emotional harms also affected the plaintiff's ability to learn and caused him to leave school for two weeks at the end of the 2009 school year. The plaintiff and his parents informed school administrators and teachers of the harassment on many separate occasions, but no effective measures were taken by the school to remedy the situation.

On August 19, 2009, the plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction. The Court issued a consent order granting the preliminary injunction on August 27, ordering the defendant to immediately put in place a number of safeguards to protect the plaintiff and to comply with school sexual harassment policies. 

The United States (U.S. Attorney's Office) moved to intervene on behalf of the plaintiff in the action on January 14, 2010. The court denied the motion on March 29, 2010 as it granted the parties' stipulation and settlement agreement. Under the agreement, the defendant was required to pay the plaintiff $50,000 in addition to attorney's fees and costs ($25,000) and the cost of obtaining counseling services up until June 30, 2013. The agreement also required that the defendant retain an expert to review the defendant's policies and practices regarding discrimination and harassment, to review these procedures themselves, and to record compliance with harassment and discrimination complaints. 

The case was dismissed with prejudice on April 27, 2010.

""Stipulation and Settlement Agreement"" is a federal civil rights case filed in August 2009 by J.L., a minor student represented by his father, against the Mohawk Central School District and several individuals, including Joyce Caputo, Edward Rinaldo, and Cynthia Stocker.

The harassment had been ongoing since seventh grade and had resulted in physical and emotional harm to J.L., affecting his academic success. The plaintiffs sought relief for these damages, as well as a permanent injunction to ensure his safety and access to education. The case was represented by lead attorneys Arthur N.

VR-MI-0074,"On August 30th, 2018, several student groups filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. Plaintiffs sued the Michigan Secretary of State, Ruth Johnson, and the Director of the Michigan Bureau of Elections, Sally Williams under 42 U.S.C. §1983 and §1988 for alleged constitutional violations of the First, Fourteenth, and Twenty-Sixth Amendments. The plaintiffs, represented by a combination of public interest and private attorneys, sought declaratory and injunctive relief prohibiting the State from enforcing Public Act 118, also known as Roger’s Law, which plaintiffs alleged put significant barriers in place for college aged students who wanted to vote. The case was assigned to District Judge Robert H. Cleland.

Specifically, plaintiffs claimed that Roger’s Law placed two major barriers in the way of students seeking to vote: Strict matching requirements and requirement that a person first vote in person. The strict matching requirement prohibited college students, who had their home address listed on state identification, from using said identification to register to vote in their college town. The in-person voting requirement prohibited college students, who would need to return to their permanent addresses to vote, from voting if they were far from home. Plaintiff claimed that these laws were driven to enactment by discriminatory intent, as shown through the explicit statement by the legislation’s drafter that he didn’t care if college-aged students couldn’t vote.

The complaint was later amended on September 7th, 2018, to add new plaintiffs, specifically more student groups. 

On September 8th, 2018, a motion for preliminary injunction was filed, but stayed while the parties negotiated a potential settlement. Along with the motion, the plaintiffs filed an expert report from Stanford Political Science Professor Jonathan Rodden supporting their arguments. 2018 WL 10072776. On September 25, the plaintiffs voluntarily withdrew their preliminary injunction. They did this because of their preparations for the 2018 midterm elections, and the potential impact that the elections would have on the outcome of the case. Status updates were moved to January 9, 2019. 

Status updates were further delayed as the Whitmer administration was sworn in and implemented policies that expanded access to vote-by-mail programs. The plaintiffs submitted a motion to voluntarily dismiss the case on June 5, 2019, perhaps because of progress toward the plaintiff's asks by the Whitmer administration. Judge Cleland dismissed the case on June 11; the case is closed.","

This case, known as Case 3:18-cv-12722-RHC-SDD, was filed on August 30, 2018 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from Perkins Coie LLP and Michigan State University College of Law, consist of the College Democrats at the University of Michigan and the Michigan Federation of College Democrats. They are challenging Michigan's restrictive voting laws, specifically Rogers' Law and the First-Time/In-Person Requirement, which make it difficult for young voters, particularly college students, to register and vote in Michigan elections. The plaintiffs allege that these laws violate the Twenty-Sixth Amendment, which guarantees the right to vote for citizens over the age of 18, as well as the First and Fourteenth Amendments, which protect the right to vote and equal protection under the law. The defendants in this case are Ruth Johnson, the Secretary of State of Michigan, and Sally Williams, the Director of the Michigan Bureau of Elections, who the plaintiffs claim have actively contributed to the disenfranchisement of student voters through their enforcement of these laws.

The plaintiffs sued the City of Cranston under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the Prison Policy Initiative, the ACLU, and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief. The plaintiffs claim that the 2012 Redistricting Plan violated the rights of the plaintiffs to equal representation under the Fourteenth Amendment of the Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs claim that the inclusion of the prison population of Adult Correctional Institutions (ACI), located in Ward 6, inflated the actual voting population of ward 6. As a result, every three citizens of Ward 6 represent the same voting power as four citizens of the other five wards. 

On March 13, 2014, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss. On September 8, 2014, Judge Ronald R. Lagueux denied the motion, holding that the court could not say that the 2012 Redistricting Plan was constitutional as a matter of law. 42 F.Supp. 3d 325 (D.R.I. 2014).  The court scheduled discovery for the next nine months. 

On July 9, 2015, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment. On August 6, 2016, a cross-motion for summary judgment was filed by the plaintiffs. 

On May 24, 2016, Judge Lagueux granted plaintiffs’ summary judgment and denied defendants'. 188 F.Supp.3d 146. The court entered declaratory judgment for the plaintiffs and enjoined the defendants from holding any new elections under the current 2012 Redistricting Plan. Furthermore, the defendants were required to come up with a new redistricting plan within 30 days. Judge Lagueux determined that while districts are generally divided according to equal populations, the prison inmates at ACI were not engaged in the civil process like other non-voters. Therefore, to include them in the total population of Ward 6 would an unconstitutional dilution of Ward’s 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5’s voting power.

Judge Lynch held, following the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Evenwel v.

Accordingly, the district court entered summary judgment in favor of the defendants on Sept. 26, 2016.

The defendants leased lots to the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) to house persons displaced by Hurricane Katrina. The U.S. claimed, based on evidence from particular complainants and witnesses and on fair housing testing, that the site's management applied various park rules more harshly against African American tenants and members of interracial households, openly made racial slurs, declared that they didn't want any African American residents living at the park, and generally harassed and intimidated black tenants. The plaintiff sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, as well as civil penalties. The case was assigned to Judge Louis Guirola.

On November 15, 2010, the Court denied defendants' motions for summary judgment; the court found that the U.S. had produced sufficient evidence of discriminatory rule enforcement, racial bias, and harassment.  Though the case was scheduled for trial, shortly before that date arrived, the parties agreed to a three-year settlement on January 7, 2011. The agreement included a standard prohibition against discrimination, but it also included restrictions on the defendant manager in any future involvements in the rental real estate business.  These restrictions included regulating the conduct of the defendant-owner in the event it re-entered the rental real estate business, including notice to the plaintiff, fair housing training, notice provisions, non-discrimination policies, detailed reporting and recordkeeping requirements to allow plaintiff to monitor its compliance, and consent to periodic compliance testing.

Plaintiffs were represented by the American Civil Liberties Union and private attorneys. Plaintiffs' complaint, filed in November of 1995, alleged an abusive, overcrowded, unsanitary, and unhealthful environment at BCCF.  It alleged forced idleness, fire danger, deficient medical care, and lack of access to the courts due to an inadequate law library.  In addition, plaintiffs claimed that BCCF violated the Establishment Clause by paying inmates to attend a Bible study class when there was little or no paid work available to other inmates and no other religious activities.  

Defendants moved for transfer and change of venue.   The district court (Judge John L. Kane, Jr.) denied these motions.  Knapp v. Romer, 909 F.Supp. 810 (D. Colo. 1995).     

A number of lawsuits were filed in the District of Colorado regarding conditions at BCCF.

This document collection pertains to a class action lawsuit (1:95-cv-01919) filed in 1995 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado, involving multiple plaintiffs who were incarcerated at the Bowie County Correctional Facility (BCCF) in Texas. The plaintiffs, including Glen Williams Jr., Christopher Rimpson, and John B.

The defendants, including the CDOC, BCCF, and various state officials, denied these allegations and sought to transfer the case to the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.

PA-NY-0001,"On December 3, 2014, three women with relatives buried in a mass grave of more than one million deceased individuals on New York City’s Hart Island filed this class action in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation, the plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, claiming violations of the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution and Sections 3, 6, and 8 of Article I of the New York State Constitution. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that New York City’s policy barred people from visiting the graves of relatives buried on the island, only allowing them to visit a “gazebo” on the edge of Hart Island. The “gazebo” is out of sight of the graves and visitors were not permitted to leave sentimental items like flowers. 
 
The case was assigned to District Judge Vernon S. Broderick. On September 28, 2015, the court granted class certification, defining the class as: ""All parents, step-parents, children (biological or adopted), stepchildren, spouses, siblings, step-siblings, half-siblings, grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, first cousins, second cousins, legal guardians of deceased individuals buried on Hart Island; wards of deceased guardians buried on Hart Island; and domestic partners of deceased individuals buried on Hart Island, who wish to visit the gravesites of said deceased individuals.""

On February 19, 2016, the parties agreed to a settlement. The City of New York agreed to provide the plaintiff class with ferry transportation to and from Hart Island, and access to the gravesites of their family members, on at least one weekend day per month. Visitors to the gravesite would be allowed to leave certain sentimental items, like flowers, small stuffed animals, and photographs, at the grave site. The City of New York also agreed to pay the plaintiff attorneys’ fees and costs totalling $58,645.00.

In December 2016, the parties met and conferred regarding the settlement and agreed to increase the maximum number of visitors able to visit the gravesites during each visitation period from 25 to 35.

The document at hand is a collection of individual summaries from various segments of the court case 1:14-cv-9533, involving a class action lawsuit filed by the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation against the City of New York. The plaintiffs, Rosaria Cortes Lusero, Marie Cruz Garcia, and Michelle Caner, brought the suit on behalf of themselves and others, alleging that the city's policy of prohibiting visits to Hart Island, a public burial ground, violated their rights. The plaintiffs argued that the policy was disgraceful and sought to end it, as they were unable to visit the gravesites of their loved ones buried on the island. The defendant in this case is the City of New York, represented by the New York City Department of Correction, responsible for the care and detention of prisoners in the city. The plaintiffs claimed that the Department of Correction made it difficult for anyone to visit the island, treating visitors as prisoners. The case was certified as a class action and the New York Civil Liberties Union Foundation was appointed as class counsel due to their expertise in handling complex litigation.

PB-DC-0010,"This case is one of several federal cases challenging the Trump Administration’s ongoing attempts to reduce Medicaid eligibility under the Affordable Care Act (ACA).    The case arose from federal and state efforts to limit the ACA’s Medicaid expansion. Medicaid, established under Title XIX of the Social Security Act, requires states to cover all individuals of a mandatory covered population group and prohibits states from imposing additional eligibility requirements. However, Section 1115 of the Social Security Act allows DHHS to waive certain federal Medicaid requirements when necessary to allow a state to carry out an experimental project that is likely to promote the Act’s objectives. 

In 2010, the ACA expanded Medicaid coverage to include adults with household incomes less than 133% of the federal poverty level (FPL). Michigan passed legislation authorizing the Medicaid expansion but sought a waiver under Section 1115 to require new enrollees to pay premiums and copayments that could be reduced by the individual’s engagement in certain “healthy behaviors.” For enrollees with incomes above the FPL, the monthly premium was set at two percent of the individual’s income. DHHS granted the waiver application, effective through December 31, 2018, but specified that no individual may lose or be denied Medicaid eligibility for failure to pay premiums or copayments.

In January 2018, DHHS issued a letter to state Medicaid directors announcing its intention to approve Medicaid waiver applications containing work requirements. This action was consistent with President Trump's January 20, 2017 executive order instructing federal agencies to scale back the ACA “[t]o the maximum extent permitted by law."" 

In response, Michigan submitted a Section 1115 waiver application that would add mandatory work requirements. The work requirements consisted of 80 hours of specified work or work-related activities per month and mandatory monthly reporting of work activities, with the loss of coverage for enrollees who do not report the required hours for three months in a 12-month period. The application also included mandatory healthy behaviors and heightened, mandatory premiums for enrollees with incomes above the FPL who received coverage for 48 cumulative months. Failure to pay a premium within 60 days after the invoice date would result in termination of coverage. Enrollees in the same subgroup also had to complete a health risk assessment or specified healthy behaviors in the 12 months before their annual redetermination to remain eligible. 

DHHS approved these three HMP waivers, effective January 1, 2019 through December 31, 2023, and granted Michigan permission to implement the measures starting January 1, 2020. The work requirements went into effect on January 1, 2020. The state deferred the implementation of the healthy behavior requirements and new premium requirements until October 1, 2020.

The plaintiffs, all members of Michigan’s Medicaid program, filed this class-action lawsuit on November 22, 2019 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS). The plaintiffs challenged amendments to the Healthy Michigan Plan (HMP), including work requirements that would result in the loss of health coverage for 61,000 to 183,000 individuals. Represented by the National Health Law Program, the Center for Civil Justice, and the Michigan Poverty Law Program, the plaintiffs requested an injunction against the defendants’ implementation of Michigan’s amended HMP eligibility requirements and declaratory relief. 

Specifically, the plaintiffs argued that the defendants failed to undergo the required rule-making process in issuing a new policy on Medicaid waivers and acted outside the scope of their waiver authority under Section 1115 of the Social Security Act in approving Michigan’s application that imposed additional Medicaid eligibility requirements. According to the plaintiffs, these actions violated the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. § 551 <i>et seq.</i>), the Social Security Act, and the Take Care Clause in Article II, Section 3 of the U.S. Constitution.  The plaintiffs sued on their behalf and on behalf of all Michigan residents enrolled in the HMP on or after January 1, 2019.  

On February 19, 2020 the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services (MDHHS) filed an unopposed motion to intervene, which was granted the next day.  On February 25, 2020, MDHHS filed a motion for partial summary judgment solely on the issue of whether the federal approval of the work and community-engagement requirements in the HMP section 1115 demonstration project was lawful.  In light of the D.C. Circuit Court’s decision in <i>Gresham v. Azar</i>, striking down the work requirements of the Arkansas Medicaid program under the Section 115 waiver, Judge Boasberg granted MDHHS’s motion for partial summary judgment.  The December 21, 2018 approval of the work and community engagement requirements in the Healthy Michigan Plan Amended Demonstration Extension Application by the defendant, Secretary Azar, was vacated.  Michigan could not enforce the Medicaid work or community engagement requirements that went into effect on January 1, 2020.

On April 2, 2020, MDHHS filed a motion to stay in light of the COVID-19 pandemic.  The same day, the court granted the motion and the case is stayed until the earlier of 1) the end of the COVID-19 public health emergency, or 2) 45 days before the date Michigan begins to implement the premiums that are conditions of continued Medicaid eligibility or the healthy behavior requirements that are conditions of continued Medicaid eligibility.

As of June 2020, the Medicaid work and community engagement requirements cannot be enforced.  The plaintiffs challenged the  payment of premium and cost sharing, community engagement, and healthy behavior components of the HMP.  The plaintiffs did not specifically challenge the rest of the waiver, but the complaint asked the court to permanently enjoin the entire HMP.  When the case resumes, the court will need to decide on the appropriate remedy, whether to disband the entire HMP, or to only vacate some or all of the specifically challenged portions. 

<b>Background</b>

Medicaid beneficiaries in four other states have filed similar suits challenging the Administration's use of Section 1115 waiver authority. See <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16440""><i>Stewart v. Azar</i></a> (Kentucky), <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17162""><i>Gresham v. Azar</i></a> (Arkansas), <i>Philbrick v. Azar</i> (New Hampshire), and <i>Rose v. Azar</i> (Indiana). In <i>Stewart v. Azar</i>, the court struck down Kentucky's waiver, which included work requirements, on the basis that the agency failed to sufficiently consider the impact of the proposed project on Medicaid coverage. Similarly, in <i>Gresham v. Azar</i>, the court found that the agency failed to adequately consider how the imposition of work requirements in Arkansas's program would lead to loss of coverage for a substantial number of beneficiaries including the needy, a core group under Medicaid.","

FA-DC-0020,"On February 29, 2016, a U.S. Army Captain and member of the Sikh faith filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sued the United States Department of Defense and the Army, among others, under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. The plaintiff, represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, the Sikh Coalition, and private counsel, asked the court for injunctive relief prohibiting the U.S. Army from forcing him to compromise his religious exercise. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the U.S. Army violated his First Amendment right to free expression of his religion. The defendants had required him to undergo extensive and repetitive testing to confirm that he could properly wear a combat helmet and a safety mask, while other soldiers with long hair and beards had not been subjected to the same testing.  

Prior to this action, the plaintiff was given temporary accommodations to keep his hair and beard unshorn and to wear a turban. However, these accommodations were set to expire on March 31. On February 29, the plaintiff filed a temporary restraining order preventing the defendants from subjecting him to non-standard or discriminatory testing. On March 3, Judge Beryl A. Howard granted the plaintiff’s motion and enjoined the defendants from subjecting the plaintiff to any such testing during the pendency of the litigation. 168 F.Supp.3d 216.

The plaintiff also filed a motion for a preliminary injunction on February 29, requesting that the U.S. Army grant him a permanent religious accommodation for his beard, hair, and turban. Judge Howell denied this motion on May 6, 2016, partially because the preliminary injunction would essentially encompass the relief sought in the underlying complaint. In the same memorandum opinion, Judge Howell also denied the plaintiff’s motion to consolidate his case with another Sikh accommodation case because the plaintiffs in that case were reservists awaiting training rather than a West Point graduate on active duty as in this case. Additionally, the plaintiffs in the second case had not been forced to undergo the same testing that this plaintiff had objected to. 185 F. Supp. 3d 11.

On March 31, 2016, the defendants filed a notice that they had extended the plaintiff’s temporary accommodation to one year, or less in the event that military necessity assigned the plaintiff to another unit. In response, on May 23, 2016, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint stating that the extension did not negate the Army’s discriminatory regulations and practices. On June 20, 2016, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. 

On July 4, 2016, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed the case without prejudice. In his filing, the plaintiff’s dismissal was made with the expectation that Sikh Americans would be successfully integrated into the U.S. military outside the context of this legal proceeding. This conclusion was supported by the following facts: (1) the defendants granted the plaintiff a ‘long-term accommodation’ which extended his earlier accommodation for at least one year from March 31, 2016; (2) the defendants had repeatedly written assurances that the plaintiff would not be subject to heightened, individualized testing concerning his helmet and safety mask; (3) while the Assistant Secretary of the Army intended to re-evaluate the plaintiff’s accommodation the following year, the plaintiff would not need to submit a new accommodation request; (4) the defendants planned to develop uniform standards for religious accommodations; (5) the plaintiff was not required to submit a new accommodation request with every new assignment, transfer of duty station, etc.; (6) no change would be made to the plaintiff’s accommodation without the evaluation being expeditiously forwarded to the Assistant Secretary; and (7) that a modification that substantially burdened the plaintiff’s religious exercise would only be permissible where the defendants could prove that they had a compelling interest to require modification, that modification was in furtherance of that interest, and that there was no less restrictive means of furthering that interest. These facts indicated that the plaintiff would not be subjected to adverse treatment by virtue of his faith for at least one year, by which time the plaintiff expected that the army would have legally sufficient accommodation guidelines in place. 

On July 5, 2016, the case was dismissed without prejudice and signed by Judge Beryl A. Howell. The case is now closed.","

This document, titled ""Simratpal Singh v. Department of Defense et al."", is a legal case filed by Captain Simratpal Singh against government officials for violating his religious freedom and First Amendment rights. The defendants in the case include Ashton B. Carter, James C. McConville, Patrick J. Murphy, and the United States Department of Defense and Department of the Army. Captain Singh, a practicing Sikh member of the United States Army, alleges that the Army's grooming and personal appearance regulations go against his sincerely-held religious beliefs and constitute a religious exercise. He is represented by attorneys from The Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and The Sikh Coalition, while the defendants are represented by attorneys from the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Columbia.

The court proceedings began with a hearing before Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell, where Captain Singh requested a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction. The defendants assured that they were working towards developing uniform standards for religious accommodations and that Captain Singh would not have to cut his hair, shave his beard, or remove his turban. However, Captain Singh argued that this temporary accommodation was not the least restrictive means of furthering a compelling governmental interest.

These three nonprofit organizations sued the U.S. Department of Education under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Represented by Democracy Forward, the National Center for Youth Law, and the National Women’s Law Center, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys’ fees.

Specifically, the complaint alleged that the Department of Education’s decision to rescind sexual violence guidance documents issued in 2011 and 2014 created educational access disparities on the basis of sex and hampered the plaintiffs' ability to do their jobs. The complaint argued that the new policy violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. It further argued that the decision had been made without the proper procedures, in violation of the APA.

On February 21, 2018, the plaintiffs amended their complaint, including several new factual allegations regarding accusations of sexual assault against top government officials and adverse changes to universities’ policies as a result of the Title IX guidance. The defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction, arguing that the plaintiffs lacked standing to sue and that the plaintiffs failed to plead that the Department of Justice had a discriminatory purpose on May 2, 2018.

These organizations argued that the parties and court did not address the issues raised in the organizations’ amicus curiae briefs as the plaintiffs did not amend the complaint to argue in favor of the right to equal treatment. 

Magistrate Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley granted the May 2, 2018 motion to dismiss on October 1, 2018 because the allegations were insufficient to show standing to bring an equal protection claim; the 2017 Guidance was not a final agency action for purposes of an APA claim; and the allegations did not plausibly suggest that the defendants acted outside their authority for the ultra vires claim. 2018 WL 4770741. The first and third claims were dismissed without prejudice and with leave to amend, while the APA claim was dismissed with prejudice. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on October 31, 2018 and the organizations refiled a motion for leave to intervene as plaintiffs on November 20, 2018. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim on December 14, 2018.

On February 19, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a motion for reconsideration of the dismissal of the APA claim. 

On March 29, 2019, Judge Corley denied the defendants' motion to dismiss for lack of Article III standing but granted their motion to dismiss the plaintiffs' equal protection and ultra vires claims. 2019 WL 143141. On that same day, Judge Scott granted the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, finding that a recent Ninth Circuit decision warranted reconsidering the plaintiffs' APA claim. 2019 WL 1434144. Finally, Judge Corley denied the motion to intervene, finding that the motion was untimely, that the intervenors failed to establish Article III standing, and that the intervenors' interests were adequately represented by the existing plaintiffs. 2019 WL 1427447. 

On April 18, 2019, the plaintiffs submitted a Third Amended Complaint, removing the ultra vires and equal protection claims and reinserting the APA claim. 

The plaintiffs and defendants filed cross-motions for summary judgment. On November 1, 2019, Judge Corley denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and granted the defendants' motion. 2019 WL 5684522. She agreed with the defendants' argument that the challenged agency action was not ""final"" for purposes of judicial review under the APA. The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit.

The case of Victim Rights Law Center et al. v. Betsy DeVos et al. centers around a challenge to the Department of Education's 2017 Title IX Policy, filed by four non-profit organizations including the Victim Rights Law Center, Equal Rights Advocates, SurvJustice, and the Women's and Children's Advocacy Project. The defendants are the United States Department of Education and its Secretary, Betsy DeVos. The plaintiffs argue that the policy, which rescinded previous guidance on sexual violence and harassment, violates Title IX and will cause irreparable harm to students, especially victims of sexual violence and harassment. They also claim that the policy undermines the rule of law and hinders their ability to fulfill their organizational missions. The attorneys involved in the case are from the organizations themselves, and the Court has granted a Motion for Summary Judgment in part, denying it in part and ordering a mediation process. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an extension for the submission of briefs. The final verdict has not yet been reached, but the case highlights the ongoing debate surrounding Title IX and the rights of survivors of sexual violence in educational settings.

JC-NM-0006,"On August 22, 2005, a female plaintiff represented by attorneys Mark E. Merin of Sacramento, California, Andrew C. Schwartz of Walnut Creek, California, and Robert R. Rothstein of Santa Fe, New Mexico, filed a class action civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for New Mexico, challenging the strip search and visual body cavity search policy in effect at the Lincoln County Detention Center.  The policy at issue required that all persons housed in the Detention Center undergo strip and visual body cavity searches before they were arraigned and without reasonable suspicion that the searches would produce contraband or weapons.  Plaintiff maintained that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution, as well as state constitutional provisions and tort law, and sought monetary damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, and class certification.  Named as defendants were Cornell Companies, Inc. and/or Correctional Systems, Inc. (""CSI"") (the company that had contracted to operate the Detention Center), the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners, and past and present Lincoln County Sheriffs.  A First Amended Complaint, filed on June 28, 2006, added individuals defendants associated with Cornell/CSI and deleted the county sheriffs as defendants.

Almost immediately after the suit was filed, Cornell issued revised strip search policies for the Lincoln County Detention Center. 

The parties engaged in extensive discovery, which included exchange of documents, interrogatories, and depositions.  The parties took a statistical sampling of the files of approximately 3,000 persons booked at Lincoln County Detention Center during the period from August 22, 2002, until August 31, 2005 and estimated that  approximately 1,200 persons who were arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, were strip searched.

On July 12 and 13, 2006, the parties participated in mediation and arrived at an agreed Stipulation of Settlement.  Under the Stipulation, the settlement class was defined as: ""all persons arrested on charges not involving violence, drugs or weapons, on or between August 22, 2002, and August 31, 2005, who were strip searched at the Lincoln County Detention Center prior to arraignment.""  Defendants agreed to pay $1.6 million for settlement of the class claims.  Of that fund, $750,000 was earmarked for distribution to qualified claimants that submitted a claim form.  The named plaintiff was to receive $100,000.  $600,000 was allocated for attorneys' fees and $150,000.00 to cover the costs of claims administration. 

 

The District Court (District Judge William P. Johnson) granted preliminary approval of the class action settlement and conditionally certified the settlement class.  Following a fairness hearing on November 29, 2007, the settlement was approved.

This document, titled ""Allison v. Lincoln County Board of Commissioners et al.,"" is a comprehensive collection of court proceedings, motions, and orders pertaining to a class action lawsuit filed in 2005 by plaintiff Sharon Allison against the Lincoln County Detention Center (LCDC) in New Mexico. The defendants named in the suit include the Lincoln County Board of Commissioners, Cornell Companies, Inc., and Correctional Systems, Inc., as well as various individuals employed by these entities at the time of the alleged incidents. The plaintiff, represented by attorneys from CASPER, MEADOWS, SCHWARTZ & COOK and ROTHSTEIN, DONATELLI, HUGHES, DAHLSTROM, SCHOENBURG & BIENVENU, LLP, alleges that the defendants implemented policies and practices that allowed for strip and visual body cavity searches to be conducted on pre-arraignment detainees without reasonable suspicion, in violation of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and state laws. Seeking damages and injunctive relief, the plaintiff filed the lawsuit on behalf of a class of individuals who were subjected to these searches between 2002 and 2005.

DR-MO-0001,"During 2003, a law professor residing in Illinois developed a mental illness.  Due to this illness, a state court appointed the Office of State Guardian as guardian of his person and, in 2004, of his estate.  He moved to Missouri, where a petition was soon filed to appoint a guardian for him.  The guardianship in Illinois did not affect his eligibility to vote while residing there, but the guardianship adjudication had a different, prohibitive impact on his voting rights in Missouri.  Thus, in October 2004, the former professor, as plaintiff and by the Office of State Guardian, filed a civil complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri, naming as defendants Missouri's governor, attorney general, and several city election officials.  The plaintiff alleged that, previously, he had been adjudged mentally incapacitated and appointed a guardian and, presently, would like to register to vote for, and to vote in, upcoming elections.  Missouri, however, had a constitutional provision and a statute that barred incapacitated persons and those under guardianship from registering to vote and from voting.  Alleging that these state laws denied him his fundamental right to vote and violated his rights under the Fourteenth Amendment's due process and equal protection clauses, as well as statutory (and related regulatory) rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C § 12131 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, the plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys fees and costs.  Numerous attorneys represented the plaintiff, including those from Illinois' Guardianship and Advocacy Commission, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, the ACLU National Voting Rights Project, and the ACLU of Eastern Missouri.

The plaintiff's motion for a preliminary injunction was denied in an unpublished opinion by District Judge Ortrie Smith on October 26, 2004.  The judge ruled that it would be inappropriate to issue injunctive relief when the plaintiff had other means of protecting his voting rights, such as seeking in state court proceedings that any guardianship order applicable to him be limited in a way that allowed for him to vote.

In December 2004, an amended complaint was filed.  It made essentially the same attacks upon the state's limitations on voting eligibility, but added two additional individual plaintiffs under guardianship orders and one associational plaintiff, the Missouri Protection and Advocacy Services, Inc. (""MOPAS"").  It also added another federal constitutional claim, alleging that the full faith and credit clause was violated by Missouri's law, since deprivation of voting rights occurred in Missouri based upon an Illinois adjudication that did not expressly deprive one of voting rights.

Also in December 2004, the Missouri probate court acted upon the petition for appointment of a guardian for the original plaintiff.  In an unpublished ruling, Circuit Judge Joan Moriarty found that the Illinois guardianship order had no extraterritorial effect and that the Illinois guardian had exceeded its authority in moving the plaintiff to a Missouri psychiatric facility.  The judge directed that the Illinois guardian move the plaintiff to an Illinois facility.  The probate court's ruling, however, was reversed on appeal eight months later.  Appellate Judge Gary M. Gaertner, Sr., writing for a panel of the Missouri Court of Appeals, found that the Illinois guardianship order was entitled to recognition and enforcement under the federal constitution's full faith and credit clause, particularly given Missouri statutes that reflected a willingness to recognize guardianship judgments without regard to the location of the guardian or the ward.  Thus, the Illinois guardian had acted appropriately in moving the plaintiff to Missouri.  That the ward had been moved back to Illinois did not fully moot the case, according to the appellate panel, due to the significance of the lower court's erroneous ruling.  In re Prye, 168 S.W.3d 116 (Mo. App. 2005).

The federal case proceeded, in the meantime, and the parties filed cross-motions for summary judgment.  These were ruled upon by Judge Smith on July 7, 2006, in an unpublished order.  By this time, two of the individual plaintiffs had been dismissed from the case at their request (including the original plaintiff), leaving MOPAS and a plaintiff under a Missouri guardianship order as the challengers to the Missouri laws.  Judge Smith first decided that the election board's recent issuance of a voter registration card to the individual plaintiff did not moot the case, because the defendants had not met their burden of showing the permanence of their voluntary cessation of the alleged wrongful conduct.  Next, he ruled that the state's use of a guardianship scheme that required individualized determination of a person's abilities and limitations sufficiently allowed for differentiating those who are qualified to vote from those who are not and, so, did not violate the federal constitution or statutes.  Additionally, the opportunity for review and modification of state guardianship orders gave wards recourse to protect their interests in voting.  Accordingly, Judge Smith granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment.

Plaintiffs appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.  On August 23, 2007, that court affirmed the district court, although on somewhat different grounds.  In an opinion by Circuit Judge James B. Loken, the court rejected the state's assertion of the Eleventh Amendment as a bar to suit against the state officials, since the named state defendants had ""some connection"" to enforcement of the allegedly unconstitutional law.  The state's arguments fared better, however, on the merits.  Judge Loken noted that the state guardianship scheme did not categorically disenfranchise persons under full guardianship, since the state's courts retained authority to preserve a ward's right to vote in accordance with the state's statutory mandate to minimize deprivation of a ward's liberty.  Thus, the state law did not deny equal protection or federal statutory rights, given the law's lack of a categorical bar to voting.  Further, the court ruled that the advocacy group plaintiff (MOPAS) lacked standing to bring suit on behalf of mere constituents, who lacked the active relationship to the organization that exists when membership exists.  Without participation by a ward who had been denied the right to vote because a guardian was appointed for reasons other than mental incapacity, MOPAS' assertion of the rights of such a hypothetical plaintiff was ""too abstract,"" according to Judge Loken, who saw MOPAS as asking for an impermissible advisory opinion.  Missouri Protection and Advocacy Services, Inc., v. Carnahan, 499 F.3d 803 (8th Cir. 2007).

Likewise, the remaining individual plaintiff could not prevail, since his local election board had denied him the right to vote in error, not noting that his guardianship order expressly allowed him to retain that right.  The board, noting the error after he had been added to the case as a plaintiff, issued him a voter registration card.  This made his pending claim for injunctive relief moot, as there was no reasonable expectation that the earlier error would be repeated.  Further, he had no standing to assert the rights of others and had not been injured by the alleged flaws in the Missouri voting laws, since his voting rights had been preserved in the guardianship order.  Id.

Efforts to seek rehearing and rehearing en banc were denied on October 18, 2007.  After the appellate ruling in favor of the defendants became final, no further material activity occurred in this case.

The case is now closed.","

This legal case, Prye v. Carnahan, involves a challenge to Missouri's laws and constitution that prohibit individuals under a full order of protection due to mental incapacity from voting. The plaintiffs, Steven Prye and Missouri Protection and Advocacy Services (MOPAS), allege that these laws violate their equal protection and due process rights, as well as the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act. The defendants are Robin Carnahan, the Secretary of State of Missouri, and Jay Nixon, the Attorney General of Missouri, who are responsible for enforcing these laws. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief to allow them to register and vote in future elections. The attorneys involved in the case include representatives from the Disability Rights Center of Kansas City, the American Civil Liberties Union, and private firms representing the defendants. After a hearing, the court denied the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. The case was later dismissed on the grounds of mootness and lack of standing, and the plaintiffs appealed this decision. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately upheld the district court's ruling. This case highlights the issue of voting rights for individuals with disabilities and the ongoing legal debate surrounding the balance between protecting these rights and ensuring the integrity of elections.",0.8341,0.1415,0.2419,0.3333,0.0563,0.0964,0.4455,0.0756,0.1292
CJ-IL-0001,"On January 13, 2006, Illinois parolees who were re-arrested for alleged parole violations filed this class action complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) arguing that they had been unconstitutionally denied a timely parole revocation hearing. For violations of their constitutional rights under the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, the plaintiffs asked the Court for preliminary and permanent injunctions.  

On May 8, 2006, the court (Judge Robert W. Gettleman) certified a class consisting of individuals held for more than 10 business days without a preliminary parole revocation hearing.  The court also granted the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction.  The court found that the parolees had a constitutional right to a prompt, preliminary parole revocation hearing and a limited constitutional right to confront and cross examine persons who had provided testimony or evidence which could be used to revoke parole. 

On November 2, 2006, the parties reached a settlement and submitted the proposed agreement to the court, which approved the consent decree on January 26, 2007.  The consent decree set specific timelines, notice provisions, and guidelines for inspections for revocation hearings. It prohibited the assignment of any DOC employee or agent from serving as Hearing Officers.  The Court also appointed a monitor to assess progress for one year after entry of the consent decree,  to be paid for his services by the defendant.  On January 23, 2008, the monitor reported that the defendants had achieved substantial compliance with the provisions of the consent decree. The Court approved the final report and discharged the monitor.

In 2012, new lawyers appeared for the plaintiff class, from the Roderick Macarthur Justice Center, at Northwestern University law school, and the Uptown People's Law Center.  On November 30, 2012, the plaintiffs moved for a rule to show cause alleging that the defendants were no longer complying with the consent decree.  On October 30 and 31, 2013, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing on the allegations.  After the hearing, the parties stated they wanted to resolve the matter via settlement, so the court reserved ruling on the motion to show cause.  The parties did reach a second settlement agreement, and on April 24, 2014, the court approved an amended consent decree.  For one year and 90 days following the entry of the amended consent decree, the plaintiffs' counsel had the opportunity to observe 15 parole hearings.  The parties reserved the determination of attorneys' fees and costs for the Court. 

After proceedings regarding attorneys' fees and costs, the court awarded the plaintiffs $140,000 for attorneys' fees and costs on October 31, 2014.

This document pertains to case number 1:06-cv-204, a class action lawsuit filed by seven inmates currently incarcerated in the Illinois Department of Corrections (IDOC) against defendants Roger E. Walker, Director of IDOC, and Jesse Montgomery, Deputy Director of Parole. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys Thomas and Kevin Peters, allege that their Fourteenth Amendment Due Process rights were violated when they were arrested for parole violations without being given a timely preliminary parole revocation hearing. They claim that their constitutional rights were further violated when they were transferred to different correctional facilities without a hearing at all. The defendants, who are being sued in both their individual and official capacities, maintain offices in Chicago and are represented by attorneys Joseph Derencius, Louise Davis, and Robert Cook. The plaintiffs seek injunctive relief and class certification on behalf of similarly situated parolees, while the defendants deny the allegations and argue that they have provided the necessary process under Morrissey v. Brewer.

NH-MO-0001,"On March 14, 2013, the United States Department of Justice filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The United States sued a Marion County-owned skilled nursing facility, the operation of which was largely funded through Medicaid, under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (“CRIPA”) and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (“ADA”), alleging that the Defendant had a practice of violating the constitutional and statutory rights of residents at the nursing home.  

Specifically, the Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant deliberately disregarded known harm or serious risks of harm to residents, and that its actions and failures to act caused harm to residents, including unnecessary segregation, and physical, mental and psychological harm. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant was violating the ADA by failing to serve individuals in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, by not taking sufficient steps to assess, identify, and prepare individuals for discharge from the facility to programs in the community. The Plaintiff also alleged the Defendant failed to adequately screen individuals who are required by federal law to be screened before admission, resulting in individuals being served in a more restrictive setting than appropriate to their needs.  

The Plaintiff also alleged that the Defendant’s healthcare services “substantially depart from professional standards,” and thus failed to provide adequate healthcare, a constitutionally protected right. The Plaintiff alleged that the Defendant failed to monitor, evaluate, update, or review individual’s care plans, despite new diagnoses or changes in conditions. For example, the Plaintiff alleged that on multiple occasions, residents showing symptoms of a stroke or began to foam at the mouth sometimes waited hours before nursing staff noticed or notified a physician.  These failures allegedly resulted in unnecessary harm, including hospitalization, preventable falls, and a decline in functional abilities.

Concurrently with the Complaint, the United States filed a settlement agreement, which it had already negotiated with the Defendant. The settlement involved a permanent injunction and declaratory judgment, and mandated improvements in three areas: (1) placement in the most integrated settings, (2) conditions of care and treatment, and (3) protection from harm. 

On March 22, 2013, Judge Charles A. Shaw for the United States District for the Eastern District of Missouri issued an order entering the settlement agreement as an order of the court. The Agreement provided for a third party to serve as the Monitor of compliance with the Agreement. The Agreement provided that it should terminate when the Defendant achieved substantial compliance with each provision of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance with the Agreement for a period of two years.

First, to ensure placement in the most integrated settings, the Agreement required the Defendant to conduct adequate pre-admission evaluations to ensure that individuals were not inappropriately admitted to the facility. The Defendant was also required to implement a discharge and transition process to ensure that individuals who could be served in more integrated settings were identified and that such individuals would be part of a robust and individualized discharge planning process and implementation. The Agreement also provided for “in-reach” by community service providers to residents to actively support them in moving to more integrated settings.

The Agreement established specific requirements for the “care plan,” or formal written individualized plan of treatment, required for each individual living at the nursing home and those at risk of being institutionalized there. 

The Defendant was required to implement a quality assurance process to oversee the discharge and transition process. It was required to review this information on a quarterly basis, and on an annual basis, create a report summarizing its quality assurance activities, findings, and recommendations, and evaluate whether it had been effective in addressing the barriers preventing individuals from receiving services in the most integrated, appropriate settings. 

Second, to improve the Defendant's conditions of care and treatment, the Agreement required the Defendant to provide individuals at Maple Lawn with adequate and appropriate protections, treatment, supports, and services to meet the individualized needs of the individuals and that are consistent with generally accepted professional standards. This involved the following: improving health care assessments and care plans, establishing an effective infection control program to minimize the spread of infections or communicable diseases, ensuring that nutrition and hydration services as well as aspiration prevention care were sufficient, improving its psychiatric and psychosocial services, specifically its policies about psychotropic medication, improving pressure sore prevention and treatment policies, providing adequate pain management services, mortality reviews for individuals who die at the Defendant’s facility or at an acute-care facility after being transferred from the Defendant’s facility, and annual quality assurance reporting.

Third, the Defendant was required to provide individuals with a safe and secure environment and ensure protection from harm. The Agreement mandated improvements in the Defendant's fall prevention and reporting policies, adequate reporting and investigation of all incidents where individuals sustain injuries, and annual quality assurance reporting.

The Agreement provided for a third party to serve as the Monitor of compliance with the Agreement. The Agreement provided that it should terminate when the Defendant achieved substantial compliance with each provision of the Agreement and has maintained substantial compliance with the Agreement for a period of two years.

The Monitor’s first Semi-Annual Compliance Report was adopted by the Defendant and filed with the court on September 19, 2013.

On January 30, 2014, the Plaintiff and Defendant filed a joint statement regarding Defendant’s compliance with the settlement agreement, informing the court that they both agreed with the Monitor’s finding that as of January 15, 2014, the Defendant had achieved substantial compliance with the terms of the Agreement.

For the next two years, the Monitor and Defendant filed semi-annual reports on compliance with the settlement agreement.

On April 15, 2016, the Plaintiff and Defendant filed a joint stipulation and motion for dismissal, in which they agreed and stipulated that the Defendant achieved substantial compliance on January 15, 2014 and remained in substantial compliance at all times through January 15, 2016.  The parties jointly stipulated to the dismissal of the action, and each paid its own costs.  District Judge Rodney W. Sippel dismissed the case, and the case is now closed.","
The document in question, ""Investigation of Conditions at Maple Lawn Nursing Home in Palmyra, Missouri,"" is a collection of individual summaries from various segments of the original document. This investigation was initiated by the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act and Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act, to assess the conditions and treatment of residents at Maple Lawn Nursing Home. The plaintiffs in this case are the U.S. Department of Justice and the individuals residing at Maple Lawn, who are protected by their constitutional and federal statutory rights outlined in the ADA. The defendant is the Maple Lawn Nursing Home, owned and operated by Marion County, Missouri. The plaintiffs alleged that the facility violated the rights of its residents by failing to provide appropriate services, inadequate medical and nursing care, improper medication practices, and inadequate measures to prevent harm. Seeking relief, the plaintiffs demanded that the nursing home improve its practices and compliance with the ADA's integration mandate, and eliminate discrimination against individuals with disabilities.

The complaint alleged that the defendant subjected the charging parties to sexual harassment because of their sex (female).  The charging parties intervened in the suit in July 2004, and the case settled by entry of a consent decree in February 2005.   

The four year consent decree required the defendant to pay a lump sum of $150,000 to the charging parties.  The consent decree also requires the defendant to comply with Title VII, retain a consultant to create or enhance an anti-discrimination and harassment policy, enhance its complaint procedure, create a policy designed to promote supervisor accountability, give bi-annual reports to the EEOC, institute anti-discrimination and harassment training, expunge the record of the charging parties, give neutral references to the charging parties, and post a notice of equal employment rights during the consent decree.

The case, EEOC v. AAMCO Transmission, Inc., et al., 05 Civ. 3362 (E.D.N.Y.), began when the New York District Office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a lawsuit against AAMCO Transmission, Inc. and its franchisee in May 2005. The class action suit was brought on behalf of African-American and Hispanic job applicants who were allegedly denied employment at AAMCO's transmission repair centers in the New York area due to discriminatory hiring practices. The EEOC claimed that the defendants had a pattern and practice of systematically rejecting qualified minority applicants in favor of less qualified white applicants, resulting in a racially imbalanced workforce. The plaintiffs sought monetary damages for the affected individuals and injunctive relief to prevent future discrimination. The EEOC was represented by attorneys from its New York District Office and its Office of General Counsel, while the defendants were represented by private counsel. After months of pre-trial proceedings, the case went to trial in March 2006. The EEOC presented evidence, including statistical data and testimony from rejected minority applicants, to support their allegations. The defendants argued that their hiring decisions were based on legitimate business reasons. After a thorough examination of the evidence",0.3218,0.3514,0.3359,0.0796,0.087,0.0831,0.1832,0.2,0.1912
PC-OH-0010,"On 06/28/1993, inmates at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility filed a Section 1983 class action suit, pro se, in the Southern District of Ohio against officials in Youngstown, Ohio of the Ohio Department of Rehabilitation and Correction.  Plaintiffs' claims were related to the treatment of prisoners during the prison riot that occurred in April 1993.  Plaintiffs alleged that defendants locked as many as ten inmates in a cell, failed to protect them from violence, did not provide them with water or working toilets, used excessive force, destroyed personal property, and denied medical care.  

In December 1993, Magistrate Judge Robert A. Steinberg appointed several private lawyers and certified the class.  By the summer of 1994, counsel, along with their expert Steven Martin, negotiated an end to the post-riot lockdown of general population inmates.  By February 1995, counsel negotiated with Defendants for a special Rules Infraction Board to handle the cases of inmates against whom administrative charges for riot-related, violent misconduct were filed.

Following extensive discovery, the parties reached an agreement and signed the Class Action Memorandum of Understanding in January 1997. The settlement included two major parts.  First, the settlement established terms to improve the """"quality of life"""" including: single-celling maximum security inmates; modifying the inmate classification system; improving racial and cultural relations; securing at least forty hours of out-of-cell time per week;  and instituting new state-wide directives on religious practices.  Second, the settlement established a $4.1 million fund, from which inmate damage claims, attorneys' fees and expenses would be paid.  The  case was dismissed conditional on completion of the reforms specified in the settlement agreement.  Following a fairness hearing, the District Court (Judge S. Arthur Spiegel) approved the settlement in April 1997.  

Michael R. Barrett was named Special Master and has filed several status reports regarding the distribution of the fund.  However, extensive litigation  continued regarding the distribution of the fund and attorneys' fees.  

On December 12, 1999, the District Court (Judge Spiegel) approved a recommendation by the claims administrator that the two class representatives be paid $7,500 apiece.
The stated basis for these awards was that ""the class representatives performed important work on behalf of the other members of class and class counsel,"" serving as a ""crucial link for class members and counsel throughout the proceedings"" and keeping the ""class members generally informed in the progress of the case and relay[ing] information back to
class counsel."" In a subsequent order, the district court stayed its grant of incentive awards pending appeal. 

In 2001, the Sixth Circuit (Judge David A. Nelson) reversed the district court's decision to grant incentive awards to the two named plaintiffs and place all inmates' claim determinations under protective order.  In re Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, 2001 WL 1667267 (6th Cir. 2001).  

On November 4, 2002, Judge Spiegel entered an order granting class counsel's request for an order increasing the awards to class members pro rata and ordering the settlement master/trustee to distribute $500,000 to be awarded on a pro rata basis on each claimant's previous award totals.  In 2004, the Sixth Circuit reversed the district court's disbursement of unassigned funds to certain prisoner-class members.  The court held that the settlement agreement did not authorize the district court to make a pro rata distribution of the remaining settlement funds.  Morris v. Voinovich, 2004 WL 1745781 (6th Cir. 2004).  

On January 20, 2005, Judge Spiegel approved the joint motion of the parties to distribute the remainder of the settlement fund.  The remaining funds are to be used to support two re-entry caseworkers who will work with the class members to help them succeed on release. The court also acknowledged that sufficient effort had been made to attempt to track down all members of the class, and that the funds allocated to the former inmates who could not be traced were returned to the general pool. A second order on the same day awarded attorney’s fees to counsel representing the class. Funds were distributed between 2005 and 2007. The case is now closed.  ","

The document at hand, titled In re Southern Ohio Correctional Facility, is a comprehensive collection of various motions, notices, and orders related to a class action lawsuit brought by inmates against the State of Ohio and other parties over a prison riot at the Southern Ohio Correctional Facility in 1993. The plaintiffs, Darrin E Morris and Eugene K Adams, represented a class of inmates who alleged that their constitutional rights were violated during the riot. The defendants included the State of Ohio, Governor George Voinovich, and Department of Rehabilitation and Correction Director Reginald A. Wilkinson. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants engaged in unconstitutional and illegal activity during the disturbance, which included violations of their due process rights and the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment.

The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys Irvin F. Kramer and Michael R. Barrett, sought relief in the form of damages and injunctive relief for the alleged violations. On the other side, the defendants were represented by attorneys Kevin Clarkson and Jefferson Roy Lewis. After years of litigation, a settlement was reached, creating a $4.1 million settlement fund for individual claims and inmate programming. However, disputes arose over the distribution of funds and individual claims, leading to appeals and further court proceedings.

MH-ID-0003,"On August 29, 2014 Ada County and the Ada County Coroner filed a complaint in the Fourth Judicial District of Idaho. They sued Disability Rights Idaho (“DRI”) under Idaho Code § 10-1201 et seq., (Uniform Declaratory Judgment Act), and Idaho Rule of Civil Procedure 57. At the request of the defendant, Disability Rights Idaho, Inc. (DRI), the case was removed to the United States District Court for the District of Idaho on September 8, 2014. On September 18, 2014 DRI filed a counterclaim under the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI), 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et seq. and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. DRI sought injunctive and declaratory relief to challenge the refusal of the Coroner to provide timely access to the records sought. Ada County filed a motion to remand the case, but the motion was denied by Judge Edward J. Lodge on April 29, 2015. 2015 WL 1944003.

Disability Rights Idaho (DRI) is a non-profit corporation that has been designated by Idaho to protect and advocate on behalf of people with mental illness, as defined in the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act of 1986, 42 U.S.C. § 10801 et. seq. (“PAIMI”). (PAIMI is a federal mandate that gives authority to investigate complaints of abuse, neglect, due process and rights violations in public and private facilities that provide overnight mental health treatment.) The dispute arose when the Ada County Coroner refused to provide its investigatory records relating to a suicide death of an individual, who had been residing in an inpatient behavioral health unit of an Ada County hospital. The Coroner denied DRI’s request for non-public records and initiated this declaratory judgment action in State court in response to DRI’s letter that stated they would initiate a federal lawsuit if necessary.  DRI submitted an answer to the Coroner’s complaint and a counterclaim. 

On June 15, 2015 both parties submitted Motions for Summary Judgment. In addition, DRI submitted a Motion to Dismiss and a Motion for Judgment on the Pleadings. The Ada County Coroner argued that regardless of PAIMI, DRI did not have the right to access the Coroner’s records of its death investigation, because the Coroner was not an “agency” as defined by PAIMI. The Coroner had also cited federal and state privacy concerns and questioned DRI’s probable cause to investigate the death. On July 20, 2015, the Department of Justice (DOJ) submitted a statement of interest stating that federal law was clear that P&A’s had broad access to investigatory records relating to mental health treatment facilities. The DOJ also stated that the Coroner’s office was an “agency charged with investigating,” as stated in PAIMI, because it was a division of the Ada County government that was responsible for investigating deaths.

On March 7, 2016, Judge Edward J. Lodge entered a judgment in favor of DRI. The court held that the Coroner was an “agency charged with investigating” reports of incidents of abuse, neglect, and injury under PAIMI and that the Coroner needed to release the records to DRI. 168 F.Supp.3d 1282. The case is now closed.","

This case, Balcorta v. Twentieth–Century Fox Film Corp., involves a dispute between Disability Rights Idaho, Inc. (DRI), a private nonprofit organization dedicated to protecting the rights of individuals with disabilities, and the Ada County Coroner and Ada County. DRI requested access to records related to the death of an individual with disabilities, D.T., who died by suicide while receiving care at a hospital in Ada County. The defendant, Twentieth-Century Fox Film Corp., argued that the federal court had jurisdiction in this case due to the presence of a federal question involving the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIMI). However, the plaintiffs, Balcorta and others, countered that the federal statute did not apply as the Ada County Coroner was not an agency described in PAIMI and thus, the case should be heard in state court.

The plaintiffs filed a civil declaratory judgment action in Idaho state court, seeking a determination on whether the Ada County Coroner was required to provide requested records and if doing so would violate any federal privacy rights. The defendant argued that the federal court had jurisdiction due to the presence of a federal question involving the Protection and Advocacy for Individuals with Mental Illness Act (PAIM",0.715,0.2792,0.4016,0.3447,0.1342,0.1932,0.3478,0.1358,0.1954
EE-AL-0006,"In September 2006, the EEOC brought this suit against AutoZone, Inc. in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Alabama, under title VII of 42 U.S.C § 2000e. In this case, it is alleged that Autozone discharged an employee who worked in a store because he opposed discriminatory conduct of his supervisor (store manager) on the basis of race and sex. The EEOC asked for (a) a permanent injunction enjoining AutoZone from engaging in retaliating or any other employment discrimination practice on the basis of race, sex or retaliation; (b) an order for AutoZone to institute and carry out policies, practices and programs which provide equal employment opportunities; (c) an order for AutoZone to provide backpay and compensate to a discharged employee; and (d) punitive damages. 

In 2003, the employee recognized that his supervisor's conduct and statements towards employees and customers were racially and sexually derogatory and harassing in nature. The employee suggested his supervisor refrain from such behavior, wrote a letter to AutoZone's district manager about the supervisor's behavior, and visited AutoZone's regional human resources manager to report harassment by the supervisor. Autozone did not take any action about the reported behavior. The employee was then discharged by AutoZone in 2004.

On October 30, 2007, the District Court (Judge Kristi DuBose) granted AutoZone's motion for summary judgment stating that (1) AutoZone's discharge of him did not constitute retaliation against him after the involvement of EEOC; and (2) the supervisor's actions did not rise to the standard of racial harassment and sexual harassment, which are requirement of protection under title VII.  The District Court entered judgment for AutoZone and dismissed the EEOC's claim with prejudice .
","

This document is a comprehensive summary of a legal case between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and AutoZone, Inc., titled ""EEOC v. AutoZone, Inc."" The case involves allegations of race and gender discrimination in the workplace. The plaintiffs, Mr. Broughton, originally hired in 2001, filed a charge of job discrimination against AutoZone. He was later rehired at a Mobile, Alabama store and promoted to store manager in September 2002. However, he voluntarily stepped down in November 2003 and subsequently complained about discriminatory conduct to AutoZone on multiple occasions. In January 2004, he was terminated in retaliation after participating in a sexual harassment investigation. The EEOC, represented by Senior Trial Attorney Debra Crook, filed a complaint against AutoZone, alleging unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII. The complaint sought a permanent injunction, policies promoting equal employment opportunities, and compensation for Mr. Broughton's losses. AutoZone, represented by attorney Stuart Roberts, filed a motion to stay the discovery process, which was denied by Judge Kristi K. DuBose. The EEOC then requested an extension of time to complete discovery and respond to AutoZone's motion for summary judgment,",0.5455,0.3554,0.4304,0.1505,0.0979,0.1186,0.2299,0.1498,0.1814
CW-NV-0001,"On April 13, 2010, a group of children in foster care in Clark County (Las Vegas), Nevada filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada. The plaintiffs sued the Nevada Department of Health and Human Services, the Nevada Division of Child and Family Services, Clark County, and lark County Department of Family Services under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and state law. (Previously, NCYL had filed a similar suit on behalf of another group of children, <i>Clark K. v. Willden</i>, in August 2006, but voluntarily dismissed it after the judge decided against certification of the class and all the plaintiffs had either aged out of the system or been adopted. That case can be found at <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14916"">CW-NV-0002</a> in this Clearinghouse.) 

Back in this case, the plaintiffs alleged that County and State officials failed to protect the health and safety of children in foster care. According to the complaint, foster children in the county were denied stability, health care, and, in many cases, even the most minimal level of safety. Many children were taken from their homes only to be subjected to physical, sexual, or psychological abuse while in the county's custody. For example, child welfare officials placed an infant and her older brother in a foster home where the baby was locked in a closet, and her brother was beaten when he tried to help her. Another plaintiff was shuttled through 40 placements in the 15 years she was in foster care. Another child was hospitalized twice in the ICU for near organ failure after being given an overdose of psychotropic drugs.

The plaintiffs sought money damages for thirteen children named in the lawsuit, and systematic improvements for several classes of children that represent more than half of the 3,600 children in foster care in the county. The suit also sought improvements for children who had not had guardians <i>ad litem</i> appointed to represent them in court, children who had not been provided early intervention services, and children who were sent to foster parents without case plans that contain the information needed to properly care for them.

In May 2010, the defendants moved to dismiss this case for failure to state a claim. After extensive hearings and related motions, on Oct. 26, 2010, U.S. District Judge Robert C. Jones dismissed the action, holding that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity because the plaintiffs failed to assert a clearly established constitutional right. 2010 WL 4362809 (D. Nev. Oct. 26, 2010). The plaintiffs, however, then appealed. On May 4, 2012, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit reversed, ruling that foster children have a clearly established constitutional right to safety and adequate medical care. 678 F.3d 991 (9th Cir. 2012) (Fletcher, J.).

On remand, the district court ordered the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint and the defendants to respond. On July 20, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, and in August 2012, the defendants moved to dismiss. Because of the delay that caused by the appeal, however, the plaintiffs had aged out of foster care, moved home with their families, or had been adopted. As a result of the plaintiffs exiting foster care, the district court on remand ruled on February 27, 2013 that only relief in the form of money damages would be available to them, except for the two plaintiffs that remained in the foster care system. 2013 WL 759479 (D. Nev. Feb. 27, 2013). Later, on January 10, 2014, the court further ruled that the two remaining plaintiffs also lacked standing to seek injunctive relief unless the plaintiffs filed a more definite statement supporting their claims as to the nature of the children's case plan deficiencies under 45 C.F.R. § 1356.21(g). 2014 WL 117562 (D. Nev. Jan. 10, 2014).

In the spring of 2014, in the midst of trial preparation and shortly after the plaintiffs served their expert witness reports, the parties entered into settlement talks. The talks resulted in a settlement agreement of $2.075 million dollars in damages, approved on November 18, 2014 and entered on January 9, 2015. About $1.6 million directly benefited the seven former foster children, while $500,000 covered attorney fees and costs for the plaintiffs’ attorneys. On November 12, 2015, the plaintiffs filed a stipulation to close the case, and the district court granted the stipulation on November 16, 2015, closing the case.","

According to the EEOC, O'Reilly Automotive violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, by forcing the pregnant employee, an assistant manager whose doctor had imposed a 30-pound lifting restriction, to take unpaid leave and subsequently firing her. The EEOC sought its costs and monetary and injunctive relief for the employee, including policy reform, backpay, reinstatement, medical expenses, compensation for emotional harm, and punitive damages.

The parties reached a settlement, which the Court (Judge Wesley E. Brown) entered as a consent decree on June 17, 2004. The 2-year decree provided $50,000 in monetary relief ($15,000 in lost wages and $35,000 in compensatory damages), subject to execution of a release of claims. The decree also provided for up to $200 for the employee to consult an attorney before signing the release. Under the injunctive provisions of the decree, O'Reilly Automotive was required to provide a positive reference, to adopt and distribute anti-pregnancy-discrimination policies to managers and supervisors, to provide equal employment training to all managers and supervisors, to post a pregnancy discrimination notice, and to report to the EEOC every 6 months about employees who took pregnancy-related leave, including whether the leave was voluntary, whether the employee was terminated, and why. The parties bore their own costs. No further court activity appears on the docket and the case is now closed.","

This document is a comprehensive summary of a legal case, EEOC v. O'Reilly Automotive Inc., that was brought before the United States District Court for the District of Kansas. The plaintiff in the case is the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), a federal agency responsible for enforcing laws against workplace discrimination. The defendant is O'Reilly Automotive Inc., a Missouri corporation with at least 15 employees. The EEOC alleges that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act (PDA) by forcing an employee, Debra Peres, to take unpaid leave and then terminating her because she was pregnant. 

Debra Peres worked at O'Reilly Auto Parts in McPherson, Kansas from August 2001 to February 2003. She started as a Parts Specialist and was later promoted to Assistant Manager. Her job performance was good and her attendance was regular. However, when her doctor imposed a 30-pound lifting restriction due to her pregnancy, the company's Human Resources department in Missouri decided she could not work and terminated her after she exhausted her leave under the Family & Medical Leave Act. The EEOC alleges that this action was a violation of Title VII and the PDA.

The U.S. claimed that Defendants engaged in a pattern and practice of intentional discrimination against African Americans, Hispanics, people from India, and families with children by instructing staff not to show newly renovated apartments to them, steering them to less desirable buildings, demanding proof of citizenship, asking them not to speak to one another in their first language, requiring stricter application requirements, and refusing services. These behaviors were confirmed by testing conducted by the Fair Housing Council of Washington.

The case proceeded towards trial, but then settled on March 7, 2011, when the Court (Judge James Robart) approved a jointly submitted Consent Decree.

It also required adoption, implementation, and notification to tenants of a Uniform Nondiscriminatory Procedure, and employee training on Fair Housing Act requirements.  In included provisions on recordkeeping, monitoring, and reporting, to facilitate compliance.

It was filed on April 2, 2012, by five such couples, each lawfully married in South Africa, Vermont, New York, or Connecticut, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York.  Represented by Immigration Equality and private pro bono counsel, plaintiffs sued the Attorney General, the Secretary of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS -- a component agency of DHS), seeking to compel recognition of their same-sex marriages and non-discriminatory adjudication of marriage-based immigrant benefits. 

Under DOMA, marriage ""means only a legal union between one man and one woman as husband and wife."" 1 U.S.C. § 7.  In each of the plaintiff couples, one spouse is American and the other foreign; if the marriage were not same-sex, the American spouse could petition for an immigrant visa for the foreign spouse and place the foreign spouse on the path to lawful permanent residence and citizenship. However, following DOMA's direction, USCIS has denied plaintiffs those immigration benefits.  Plaintiffs argue that this denial is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause, constituting discrimination on account of both sexual orientation and sex. 

The Obama administration has announced that in its view, DOMA is unconstitutional and has therefore declined to defend it in court (although the federal government continues to enforce the statute).  Accordingly, a ""Bipartizan Legal Advisory Group"" (BLAG) has been appointed by the (Republican) House of Representatives to appear in cases like this one and defend the constitutionality of DOMA.  BLAG filed papers in this case on May 31, 2012.

The plaintiffs, five committed, loving same-sex couples who are lawfully married, including both U.S. citizens and foreign nationals, challenged the constitutionality of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) as it applied to their immigration rights. They argued that if they were different-sex couples, the federal government would recognize their marriages and grant their foreign spouses immigration benefits. However, because they were same-sex couples, DOMA prevented federal recognition of their marriages, denying them the same rights and benefits as different-sex couples.

The Third Circuit vacated and remanded the decision for a temporary restraining order on August 25, 2020. The case is ongoing. <hr>

A group of 22 medically vulnerable plaintiffs in civil detention facing potential deportation filed a hybrid putative class action and habeas corpus proceeding in the United States District Court Middle District of Pennsylvania asking for release in the light of the COVID-19 pandemic. On April 3, 2020, represented by the ACLU of Pennsylvania and the law firm Dechert LLP, the plaintiffs asked for a temporary restraining order against the detention centers and their wardens, including Mr. Clair Doll in his official capacity as the warden of the York County Prison, Craig A. Lowe as Warden of Pike County Correctional Facility, Simona Flores-Lund as Field Office Director, Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO), U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Matthew Albence as Acting Director of ICE, and Chad Wolf as Acting Secretary of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.

The plaintiffs based their request to the court on the defendants’ alleged failures to adequately protect high-risk detainees from contracting COVID-19. Since March 31, 2020, the conditions at the facilities had deteriorated, with cramped, overcrowded facilities hindering social distancing, increased numbers of positive COVID-19 test results, and the rising necessity of quarantining. They based their claim for relief on the similarities between this case and Thakker v. Doll (found <a href=""https://clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17460"">here</a> in the Clearinghouse), where the court found that the ICE detention centers could not provide adequately safe conditions for the detainees and thereby ordered their release.

This document is a collection of summaries from segments of a legal case in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama. The case, 3:97-cv-01453-MHT-JLC, involves the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) as the plaintiff and Victoryland, an Alabama corporation, as the defendant. The plaintiff, Lisa Flaherty, was a female employee at Victoryland who alleged that she was discriminated against and retaliated against for her pregnancy. The EEOC filed a complaint on her behalf, and Flaherty intervened in the lawsuit. The complaint also alleged violations of the Equal Pay Act of 1963. The EEOC and Victoryland reached a settlement, which included monetary relief for Flaherty, training for management on sex discrimination, and a non-discrimination notice to be posted at the facility. The settlement also prohibited retaliation against Flaherty and others involved in the lawsuit. The attorneys involved were from the EEOC and Victoryland, and the court held several conferences and issued orders for depositions and mediation. The case was eventually dismissed with prejudice by the court, meaning it cannot be brought to court again.",0.4317,0.5302,0.4759,0.1099,0.1351,0.1212,0.224,0.2752,0.247

This document is a complaint filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Saw Creek Estates Community Association, Inc. for alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The plaintiff, Brenda Godfrey, is an African American employee of the defendant company and is represented by attorneys Iris Santiago Flores, Jacqueline H. McNair, and Judith A. O'Boyle. The defendant, Saw Creek Estates Community Association, Inc., is a Pennsylvania-based business association with at least 15 employees and is represented by attorneys John A. Adams and Mariellen D. Bello. The complaint alleges that Ms. Godfrey was subjected to racial and sexual harassment by both white members/customers and her immediate supervisor, Nicholas Mazzarella. She also faced a hostile work environment and was falsely accused of having a sexual relationship with her supervisor, causing emotional distress and affecting her work performance. Despite her repeated complaints, the defendant failed to take any corrective action. The EEOC is seeking a permanent injunction to prevent further discrimination and harassment, as well as policies and practices to promote equal employment opportunities and a harassment-free work environment. The case was assigned to Honorable William J. Nealon, who ordered a Case Management Conference to take place on March ",0.3058,0.4172,0.3529,0.0976,0.1333,0.1127,0.1796,0.245,0.2073
PN-CA-0044,"This lawsuit, brought in the the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California, was filed on June 3, 2020. The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the ACLU of Southern California. This lawsuit followed nation-wide protests that occurred in response to the killing of George Floyd by a police officer in Minneapolis. While most protests were peaceful, some ended in violence, property destruction, rioting, and looting. Many cities, including Los Angeles and San Bernardino, issued curfews in an attempt to quell these riots.

This action challenged these curfews as violations of free speech and assembly, free movement, due process, and challenged the San Bernardino curfew as a violation of the establishment clause (the San Bernardino curfew included a provision that exempted attendants of religious meetings from the curfew.) The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief that would void the curfew and prohibit the cities from enforcing them.

The following day, June 4th, 2020, the case was assigned to District Judge Philip S. Gutierre and to Magistrate Judge Pedro V. Castillo. Judge Gutierrez informed the parties that he was part of a mandatory alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program and asked the parties to try to form an agreement before going to trial. 

On July 7, 2020, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the complaint, citing that fact that the city had rescinded the curfews already and not attempted to reinstate them. The case is now closed.","

The complaint filed on June 3, 2020, in the United States District Court, Central District of California, by Black Lives Matter-Los Angeles and four individuals challenged the constitutionality of curfew orders imposed by the City of San Bernardino and the City and County of Los Angeles. The plaintiffs accused government officials, including Mayor Eric Garcetti and Sheriff Alex Villanueva, of violating their First Amendment rights by suppressing their free speech through the curfews. Represented by attorneys from the ACLU Foundation of Southern California and the ACLU of Southern California, the plaintiffs sought relief for these violations, including the dismissal of the curfew orders. The case was assigned to Judge Philip S. Gutierrez and referred to Magistrate Judge Pedro V. Castillo. The defendants included government officials and entities, such as Mayor Garcetti, Sheriff Villanueva, the City of Los Angeles, and the City of San Bernardino. The plaintiffs argued that the curfews were not narrowly tailored to achieve their stated interests and that other laws, such as those against destruction of property and failure to disperse, could have been used instead. They also raised concerns about the arbitrary nature of the curfews and how they disproportionately affected low-income individuals. The plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order",0.5359,0.4726,0.5022,0.226,0.1992,0.2117,0.2871,0.2532,0.2691
IM-TX-0027,"By filing a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas on February 6, 2008, which they amended on April 7, 2008, and again on September 16, 2008, nine named plaintiffs brought a class action lawsuit naming, as defendants, the U.S. State Department and the United States.  The plaintiffs alleged that each had been born in the U.S. years earlier, with the births occurring not in a medical facility but typically attended by a midwife who, for some, registered the birth as occurring in the U.S.  Recently, each plaintiff had applied for a U.S. passport.  Rather than adjudicate their applications by granting or denying each a passport, the State Department requested additional proof of U.S. citizenship from each.  After supplying additional proof, the plaintiffs alleged that, usually, the agency did not acknowledge its receipt and, instead, advised the plaintiffs that their applications would be filed ""without further action.""  To the plaintiffs, this kind of stalling non-decision was how the agency avoided legal formalities and approvals required to actually deny a passport application and constituted, effectively, denial.  The plaintiffs' U.S. citizenship assertions were often complicated by their having also been registered in Mexico as having been born there.  Bogus Mexican birth registrations, filed by their parents, typically made the plaintiffs eligible for health benefits or school in that country when, at times, the parents resided there.

Represented by the ACLU and private counsel, the plaintiffs sought to represent a national class consisting of ""all persons who have filed or will in the future file applications for United States passports, in whose cases, on or after April 8, 2003, the defendants did, or will in the future, 'file' or 'close' their applications without formally adjudicating them.""  The plaintiffs alleged that their inability to travel freely, resulting from the effective denial of their passport applications, significantly and unlawfully restricted their liberty.  They sought a declaratory judgment under 8 U.S.C. § 1503 that the named plaintiffs were, in fact, U.S. citizens; a class-wide declaratory judgment that defendants had violated due process by failing to adjudicate and otherwise obstructing the class's applications, and corresponding injunctive relief; a class-wide declaratory judgment that defendants had violated equal protection by treating the class differently from similarly situated U.S. citizens of different race, ethnicity or ancestry, and corresponding injunctive relief; a class-wide declaration that defendants had violated the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. § 703, by acting arbitrarily and capriciously, and corresponding injunctive relief; a writ of mandamus compelling the defendants to actually adjudicate the applications and issue the passports; and attorneys' fees and costs. Plaintiffs also initially sought habeas relief, but dropped this cause of action in their second amended complaint.

On October 15, 2008, the defendants filed a partial motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim upon which relief can be granted.  Over the course of the following six months, several individual plaintiffs obtained their passports and voluntarily dismissed their claims.

On June 26, 2009, the parties informed the District Court that they had come to a agreement. Under the terms of their proposed settlement, the defendants agreed to re-adjudicate the applications of the class without denying them solely because an applicant had been birthed by a midwife on defendants' list of suspected or known birth certificate forgers, and to waive fees if the class member made a request by June 1, 2010. Defendants also agreed to train their employees on re-adjudication under the terms of the settlement, to give notice to the class, and to pay attorneys' fees of $150,000. The Court was to retain only contingent jurisdiction to mediate disputes over the settlement should the other dispute resolution mechanisms listed be exhausted, and the settlement was to last for two years and eleven months.

The parties moved for preliminary approval and class certification for settlement purposes, and the Court (Judge Randy Crane) granted their motion on July 7, 2009.

After hearing objections from individuals who wanted to be covered by the settlement but who had been denied passports and were thus not part of the class, and responses from the parties, who pointed out that the objectors were not bound by the settlement and could thus still bring their own claims, the Court (Judge Crane) gave its final approval to the settlement on August 14, 2009.

(Note that on July 2, 2009, the Court approved the motion of three plaintiffs to sever their individual claims under 8 U.S.C. § 1503 for declarations that they were U.S. citizens, and created the separate case of Castelano v. Rice, No. 7:09-cv-00177, to address these claims. By October 25, 2010, all three plaintiffs had received their passports and dismissed their claims, reserving the right to file future 8 U.S.C. § 1503 claims should the need arise.)

This case, titled J.S., et al. v. United States of America, was a class action lawsuit filed on behalf of four individual plaintiffs, J.S., Sofia Elizabeth Lopez, Amalia Ramirez Castelano, and Jose Santos Araujo, against the United States. The plaintiffs alleged that they were unlawfully denied citizenship or naturalization due to the defendants' failure to properly process their applications. The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys Thomas Widor, Elisabeth Lisa S. Brodyaga, and Elizabeth J. Stevens. The defendants, represented by attorney Jason Smith, responded with a motion to dismiss and sever, which the plaintiffs opposed with a sur-reply and a response to the defendants' notice of supplemental authority. The court granted a motion for attorney Thomas Widor to appear pro hac vice for the plaintiffs. The court proceedings included various motions and stipulations of dismissal, as well as a voluntary dismissal by some plaintiffs. The final verdict was reached after a joint motion for an extension of time and a stipulation of dismissal were filed.

The complaint alleged that the New York State Office of Mental Health [OMH] and the New York State Department of Correctional Services [DOCS] were deliberately indifferent to the serious mental health needs of state prisoners with mental illness, in violation of the Eighth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act.  Specifically, plaintiff alleged that a cycle of torment existed within the New York state prison system: a lack of adequate mental health care resulted in the placement of prisoners with mental illness in isolated confinement, which in turn caused greater psychiatric harm to those prisoners.   Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief.

Defendants filed a motion to transfer the case which was denied by the District Court (Judge Gerard E. Lynch) on October 31, 2002.  Thereafter, the parties conducted discovery through 2006.  

In April 2007, the parties reached a settlement, which Judge Lynch approved on April 27, 2007.  The settlement requires that prisoners with serious mental illness confined in Special Housing Units (""SHU"") will now receive a minimum of 2 hours per day of out of cell treatment and that prisoners in the RMHU receive as many as 4 hours, in addition to an hour of recreation.

The settlement also provides: <ul><li>Multiple reviews of disciplinary sentences for prisoners with mental illness for the purpose of removing prisoners with serious mental illness from isolated confinement. 
<li>Residential programs for 405 prisoners with serious mental illness. 
<li>215 Transitional Intermediate Care Program beds for prisoners with mental illness in general population. 
<li>90 additional Intermediate Care Program beds for prisoners with mental illness who cannot tolerate the prison general population. 
<li>A 100 bed Residential Mental Health Unit (""RMHU"") which will provide 4 hours per day of out-of-cell programming for prisoners with serious mental illness who would otherwise be in SHU. 
<li>The above are in addition to 310 residential mental health programs beds which the state instituted after the litigation commenced. 
<li>An additional 20 psychiatric hospital beds for prisoners in need of acute care. 
<li>Universal and improved mental health screening of all prisoners at admission to prison. 
<li>Improved suicide prevention assessments, now required upon admission to SHU. 
<li>Improved treatment and conditions for prisoners in psychiatric crisis in observation cells. 
<li>Limits on the use of observation cells, where prisoners in psychiatric crisis are deprived of most possessions and clothing. 
<li>Limits on punishment of prisoners with mental illness who hurt themselves because of their illness. 
<li>Limits on the use of the punitive 'restricted diet' (a loaf made from bread and cabbage) as a punishment for misconduct by prisoners with serious mental illness. 
<li>Elimination of isolated confinement of prisoners with serious mental illness in cells that have solid steel doors that severely isolate and restrict communication. </ul>The new state budget provides monies to carry out the State's commitments in the settlement agreement. These funds approximate over $50 million in capital construction costs; $2 million for additional OMH staffing for the 2007-2008 year to grow to $9 million when construction is complete; and nearly $2 million for additional DOCS staffing for the 2007-2008 fiscal year.","

The document in question, titled ""Plaintiffs v. New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision,"" is a comprehensive collection of individual summaries from various documents related to a class-action lawsuit filed in 2004. The lawsuit, filed by the Legal Aid Society and the Prisoners' Legal Services of New York, centers around a group of prisoners with mental illnesses who have received inadequate mental health care while incarcerated in New York State prisons. These prisoners, represented by experienced civil rights lawyers and mental health advocates, allege that the New York State Department of Corrections and Community Supervision (DOCCS) has violated their constitutional rights under the Eighth Amendment by failing to provide proper treatment for their mental health needs.

The plaintiffs in this case include individuals with diagnoses such as Schizophrenia, Bipolar Disorder, and Antisocial Personality Disorder, who have a history of hospitalizations and suicide attempts. They have all experienced mistreatment and inadequate care, including being placed in solitary confinement and being denied proper medication. The plaintiffs seek relief in the form of improved mental health care, an end to mistreatment, and compensation for their suffering.

However, the intervenors' complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated on the basis of race in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by failing to promote the charging parties, Black employees, because of their race and retaliating against them for their complaints of the discrimination by negatively affecting the terms and conditions of their employment.  Two of the charging parties intervened in the suit in October 2000.  After some discovery disputes, the EEOC and the defendant appear to have reached a tentative settlement agreement in May 2001.

The plaintiffs in this case are Carrie Collander (now known as Carrie Spillane) and a class of female employees who were subjected to sexual harassment and discrimination at the bank's Fox River Business Development Group in Illinois. The defendant, Fifth Third Bank, is accused of creating a hostile work environment and unequal treatment based on the plaintiffs' gender, ultimately resulting in some of them being constructively discharged. The EEOC is seeking relief under Title VII and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, including an injunction to stop the discriminatory practices and provide compensation to the affected employees. Carrie Collander, the plaintiff, is a former employee of Fifth Third Bank who joined the case as an intervenor in October 2003. The original complaint was filed by the EEOC in September 2003, after conducting an investigation and finding reasonable cause to believe that the female employees were discriminated against based on their gender.

The plaintiffs were represented the NAACP Legal Defense Fund and private counsel, and alleged that Wet Seal, Inc., and related corporations, which sell women's clothing in Wet Seal and Arden B. retail stores., had engaged in racial discrimination and retaliation in violation of 42 U.S.C. § 1981. The plaintiffs filed the retaliation claims on their own behalf and the discrimination claims as a class action on behalf of black current or former store-management employees.  The complaint sought injunctive relief, including reinstatement and monetary relief in the form of back pay, front pay, attorneys' fees, punitive damages, and compensation for emotional distress.

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendant discriminated against black employees in hiring, pay, promotion, and discipline, in comparison to similarly situated white employees. Plaintiffs further argued that senior level company management discriminated against black employees by firing them on account of their race and without cause. Senior-level management had pursued a racially discriminatory brand image of white women, preferably with blond hair and blue eyes, especially in markets with a greater percentage of white clientele, by instructing various levels of management to ""diversify"" stores with largely black employees by hiring more white employees and firing black employees. The plaintiffs claimed that their difficulty in obtaining subsequent employment was due to retaliation for resisting the defendant's discriminatory policies, alleging that the defendant had failed to provide fair references, and in one case, even failed to verify employment.

On Jan. 9, 2013, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, that among other amendments, added another named plaintiff and new claims: a claim for discrimination under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 (42 U.S.C. § 2000e) and claims for retaliation and hostile work environment under Title VII on behalf of individual plaintiffs.

On May 8, 2013, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary approval of a class action settlement, preliminary approval of settlement class, appointment of plaintiffs' counsel as class counsel, approval of notice plan and distribution of notice, and setting schedule for final approval. The settlement addressed both the class action and individual claims. The terms of the proposed settlement provided for a payment of $7.5 million, which included up to $1.8 million for attorney's fees and costs and $120,000 for administration of claims. The proposed settlement included injunctive relief, including diversity, nondiscrimination, and investigation training; development of fair job-related evaluation criteria; and a dedicated phone line for verifying employment.

On June 10, 2013, a motion hearing was held before District Judge Andrew J. Guilford. The court granted class certification, appointed the plaintiffs' counsel as class counsel, and preliminarily approved the Settlement Agreement, and stayed all further litigation not related to the settlement approval process. Regarding the notice plan and distribution of notice, the court suggested several changes at the hearing that the parties adopted. On June 12, 2013, Judge Guilford signed the order, which included the following deadlines: class counsel was to file a motion for final approval of the settlement and Settlement Agreement by Oct. 18, 2013, and class counsel was to file a reply to any objection from class members no later than Nov. 11, 2013.

On Nov. 18, 2013, a final approval hearing was held. On Dec. 9, 2013, the court issued an order granting final approval of the settlement. The court awarded a total of $1,729,037.80 to class counsel, which included attorneys' fees and reasonable costs for work performed to date as well as future monitoring and enforcement through the three-year term of the settlement. The court also granted in part the fee application by the plaintiffs' original attorney - who had been terminated from the plaintiffs' litigation team on July 3, 2012, and had disputed the terms of the settlement agreement - and found that she was entitled to a total fee award of $70,962.20.

Over the 36 months of monitoring required by the settlement, the defendant filed periodic Monitor's Certificates of Compliance, in which the Monitor, the defendant's Vice President and Corporate Controller, certified to the court the status of the defendant's implementation of its programmatic initiatives with the Settlement Agreement. In the Dec. 11, 2014, Certificate of Compliance, the Monitor stated that it was satisfied that the defendant was complying with the Settlement Agreement.

The plaintiff, represented by private counsel asked the court for declaratory relief, economic losses. compensatory and consequential damages, and punitive damages claiming under Title 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the defendants failed to provide medical care and treatments as well as failure to properly train and supervise.

On the morning of February 18, 2006, Emily Rice was involved in a non-fatal car collision in which her car was destroyed and she suffered life-threatening injuries. After being transported by paramedics to the local hospital Denver Health, operated by the Defendant, she complained of shoulder and abdomen pain. She was booked at the Denver Health as a detainee. The only test performed on Rice was a breathalyzer to determine her blood alcohol which was determined to be .12. Rice was given ibuprofen and then released to the Denver Sheriffs for detention at the Denver County Jail. She was placed in an isolation cell for several hours. Rice continued to complain and was briefly seen by a nurse who told Rice to sleep the pain off. Rice fainted during the intake process. She was not treated by the jail nurse. The Denver Jail staff pulled Rice to her feet and continued the intake process. Rice began to complain of numbness in her feet which had turned cold and grey. The jail doctor was informed of Rice's condition and diagnosed her with drunkenness for which she needed to get sleep. Throughout the night Rice and other inmates yelled for help for which there was no reply from the guards. Eventually Rice complained of numbness is her legs and that was unable to move them. The on-staff nurse was informed of Rice's condition; she never visited to Rice to treat her. Approximately 24-hours after Rice's car collision, she died in her jail cell. The official medical report stated that the cause of death was a ruptured spleen. 

On December 2, 2008, settlement was reached for a non-disclosed amount. Media reports stated the amount was approximately $4 million. On December 17, 2008, Judge Marcia Krieger dismissed the case in light of the settlement. ","

This comprehensive document is a summary of a complex and ongoing court case filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado, designated as Civil Action No. 07-cv-01571-MSK. The plaintiffs in this case are the Estate of Emily Rice, represented by Susan Garber and Roy Rice as co-personal representatives, and Susan Garber and Roy Rice individually as parents and co-personal representatives. They are suing the defendants, the City and County of Denver, Colorado; Denver Department of Health and Hospitals; and various individuals in their individual and official capacities, including doctors, nurses, captains, sergeants, and deputies. The complaint alleges that the defendants were negligent in their roles as medical professionals and law enforcement officers, resulting in the death of Emily Rice. The plaintiffs are seeking damages for emotional distress and pain and suffering caused by the defendants' deliberate indifference. They are also requesting declaratory and equitable relief, economic losses, compensatory and punitive damages, and pre- and post-judgment interest. The plaintiffs have asserted three categories of claims against Nurse Mary Cleary, a registered nurse: failure to provide medical care, deprivation of familial association, and state claims for outrageous conduct, wrongful death, and medical negligence.

CJ-NY-0013,"On January 8, 2016, plaintiffs filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York to recover property seized by the NYPD after an arrest. The case was assigned to Judge Denise L. Cote. The individual plaintiff was arrested in November 2014, and his iPhone and $1,399 in wages were seized by police. In his criminal case, which was dismissed in May 2015, he was represented by the Bronx Defenders, who are the second plaintiff to this lawsuit. The Bronx Defenders, a non-profit organization that provides criminal defense and civil legal services to law-income people in the Bronx, also assists hundreds of clients every year who are attempting to retrieve property seized pursuant to an arrest. Together they brought this lawsuit against the City of New York under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the city violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as compensatory damages for the individual plaintiff for the monies seized from him at his arrest, the replacement costs for his iPhone, and all applicable interest. 

According to the complaint, after a person is arrested, the NYPD routinely seized his or her personal property and recorded it in a computerized invoice system that tracked and categorized it. Once the criminal case against that individual was terminated, and the time to appeal had lapsed, the U.S. Constitution mandated that the government demonstrate a new legal basis to retain the property. But in practice, the NYPD often retained property and refused to release it until claimants obtained a ""DA Release,"" even where all charges had been dismissed and sealed. In the Bronx, the District Attorney's Office frequently failed to respond to requests for DA Releases, and the City did not provide an alternate recourse or assistance. The plaintiffs here alleged in the complaint that they tried numerous times - via voicemails, letters, and in-person requests - to obtain the property seized by the NYPD with no success. They subsequently filed this complaint against the city. The proposed class would consist of ""all individuals who have been or will be unable to secure the release from the NYPD Property Clerk of Personal Property seized in connection with an arrest where (i) the individual named on the voucher for the property can no longer be tried on any charge that was the original basis for the arrest, and (ii) the City has made no showing of any continued basis to retain the property.""

On May 17, 2016, Judge Cote signed an order referring this case to a magistrate judge for settlement, and the settlement discussions were to take place in June. However, on June 3, 2016, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint, which added two additional individual plaintiffs who experienced similar property loss by the NYPD and provided more facts as to the NYPD's process of returning property seized after an arrest. Five days later, the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification.

On July 25, 2016, the parties agreed to stay all proceedings through February 28, 2017 to work toward a possible settlement. Accordingly, on the same day, Judge Cote ordered that the plaintiffs' motion for class certification be denied without prejudice to renewal upon the expiration of the six-month stay. On March 1, 2017, the parties agreed to extend the stay, and at the parties’ consent, Judge Cote referred the case to Magistrate Judge James Francis for further settlement discussions. On June 22, 2017, after nearly a year of unsuccessful settlement negotiations, the court lifted the stay, and litigation continued.

Despite this, the parties did eventually reach a settlement agreement on February 9, 2018. The court ordered the settlement agreement into effect three days later. This settlement agreement required the city to pay the plaintiffs a total of $10,000 in damages and create a committee to assess its compliance over the two years that the agreement would be in effect. The Bronx DA was also required to reform its policies to make it easier for arrestees to recover their seized property in a timely fashion. The parties agreed to resolve their dispute over attorneys’ fees at a later date.

On August 15, 2018, the parties agreed that defendants would pay $675,000 to cover all costs and attorneys’ fees. 

In an order issued on February 19, 2020, the obligations of the settlement were extended for the City of New York until June 30, 2020. The Bronx DA was released from its settlement obligations on February 12, 2020. As of May 27, 2020, there are no further entries in the docket, and the case is ongoing for enforcement.

""Plaintiffs' Complaint"" is a civil rights lawsuit filed against the City of New York by Victor Encarnacion and The Bronx Defenders. The plaintiffs allege that the City has a policy and practice of retaining personal property, specifically Arrest Evidence, even after criminal cases have been terminated and all charges have been dismissed and sealed. This goes against the plaintiffs' rights secured by the United States Constitution, which requires a new legal basis for the government to hold onto property after criminal proceedings have ended. Represented by The Bronx Defenders, the plaintiffs argue that this policy disproportionately affects low-income individuals and communities of color who are already targeted by the NYPD. They seek compensatory damages for the loss and expenses incurred due to the City's actions. The defendant, the City of New York, is represented by attorney Karen Marie Griffin, along with former Police Commissioners William Bratton and Raymond Kelly. The case was filed in January 2016 and has since undergone several updates, including changes in lead attorneys and multiple scheduling orders. After a motion for partial summary judgment was granted in April 2017, the plaintiffs and the City reached a settlement agreement on February 12, 2018, which was ultimately approved by Judge Denise L. Cote. The attorneys involved in the case",0.7277,0.1972,0.3103,0.3302,0.0892,0.1404,0.3662,0.0992,0.1562
PC-CO-0028,"On November 3, 2016, a female prisoner in the custody of the Denver Women’s Correctional Facility filed this pro se lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiff sued the State of Colorado, the Colorado Department of Corrections, and the Warden of the Denver Women’s Correctional Facility under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking damages. She claimed that defendants violated the ADA as well as her constitutional rights to due process under the Fourteenth Amendment and against cruel and unusual punishment under the Eighth Amendment. 

Specifically, the plaintiff alleged she was denied a Sorenson Video Phone (SVP) after she placed multiple requests with the Department of Corrections to provide one so that she could communicate with her parents, who were deaf. The SVP offers a service for the deaf community paid for by the government for those who qualify under the ADA. Although the plaintiff originally struggled to meet the court’s pleading standards, once she obtained counsel from the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center on March 31, 2017, she filed a third amended complaint on June 15, 2017, adding three new plaintiffs. The new complaint also added claims under the Rehabilitation Act and replaced allegations of Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment violations with claims of First Amendment violations. 

The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Gordon P. Gallagher and then later reassigned to Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak. On June 30, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the third amended complaint, claiming that the plaintiff lacked standing to assert her claims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act and that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.

The court disagreed with the defendants’ arguments and on September 29, 2017, denied the motion to dismiss. The court found that the plaintiff had standing to assert her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, that the plaintiff pleaded sufficiently plausible claims for relief. 

On January 22, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint, adding two plaintiffs and removing the Fourteenth Amendment claim. The defendants filed an answer to this complaint on February 5, 2018. The plaintiffs dismissed an additional defendant on October 25, 2018 without explanation. Four days later, the plaintiffs filed a motion for partial summary judgment, arguing that the Colorado Department of Corrections could not prove that the TTY phones it had were as effective as videophones and that CDOC provided no affirmative defenses under the Effective Communication Claim. In response, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment on October 29, 2018, arguing in part that the plaintiffs failed to exhaust their administrative remedies through the prison grievance system.

The plaintiffs joined their case with <i>Rabinkov v. Colorado Department of Corrections</i>, another federal case against the CDOC regarding the provision (or lack thereof) of videophones to deaf prisoners or relatives of deaf individuals on November 20, 2018. On December 27, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to certify a class of similarly-situated deaf prisoners; however, the motion was withdrawn less than a month later. 

On January 14, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss, and on January 17, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On January 25, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the plaintiffs’ claim for failure to state a claim; this was dismissed by Judge Varholak on April 9, 2019. Defendants then moved for summary judgment and for dismissal on mootness grounds on May 6, and June 21, respectively. 

On September 18, 2019, Judge Varholak ruled on several outstanding motions: the defendants’ motion to dismiss, filed on June 21, 2019, one plaintiff’s motion for summary judgment, filed on January 17, 2019, and the defendants’ motion for summary judgment, filed on May 6, 2019. Judge Varholak denied the June 21 motion (finding that the defendants had not met the burden to show that the plaintiffs’ claims were moot), granted the January 17 motion (one plaintiff’s motion for partial summary judgment on ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims), and granted in part and denied in part the May 6 motion (finding that two out of three plaintiffs had failed to exhaust administrative remedies but denying the defendants’ motion to dismiss regarding the remaining plaintiff’s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, First Amendment claims, and claims for compensatory damages). Finally, Judge Varholak ordered the Colorado Department of Corrections to make videophones available and to adopt effective and comprehensive policies relating to videophones. 2019 WL 4464036.

On October 4, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a joint motion for referral to a settlement conference, and Magistrate Judge N. Reid Neureiter was assigned to conduct a settlement conference. The parties gave no reason for the sudden change in tactic. Currently, the conference is scheduled for October 28, 2019. The case is ongoing.

This document, titled ""Order on Plaintiffs' Motion for Summary Judgment and Defendants' Motion to Dismiss,"" is a ruling from the United States District Court for the District of Colorado in a case involving four deaf inmates suing the Colorado Department of Corrections (CDOC) for discrimination under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. The plaintiffs, Andrew Atkins, Cathy Begano, Bionca Charmaine Rogers, and Marc Trevithick, are all incarcerated at the Denver Women's Correctional Facility and are represented by attorneys from the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center. They allege that CDOC has denied them effective communication through the use of TTY technology, a violation of their rights. The defendants, including CDOC and its officials, have filed a motion to dismiss the case, which was denied by the court. The plaintiffs also filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted by the court. After considering the evidence and arguments presented by both parties, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering CDOC to provide videophones for all deaf and hard of hearing inmates. The court also awarded the plaintiffs compensatory damages and attorney fees.

IM-PA-0016,"COVID-19 Summary: Twelve particularly vulnerable immigration detainees filed this habeas petition and complaint on March 24, 2020. The Court granted release on March 31, holding that their ongoing detention was unlawfully punitive given the grave threat posed by congregate detention during the coronavirus pandemic. On April 17, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, seeking class certification for all civil immigrant detainees in the Middle District of PA over the age of 45 or with underlying health conditions. On April 27, the court granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction, ruling that the plaintiffs who were detained at Pike County Correctional Facility could remain free, but those who were detained at York County Prison and at Clinton County Correctional Facility were to return to detention. Based on evidence of a plaintiff contracting COVID-19, the court granted in part plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration, allowing the plaintiffs who are sick to remain free but ordering those who are asymptomatic to return to detention. A motion for classwide preliminary injunction is currently pending before the court. <hr>

On March 24, 2020, twelve civil immigration detainees held by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at York County Prison (YCF), Clinton County Correctional Facility (CCCF), and Pike County Correctional Facility (PCCF) -- who because of their age or underlying medical conditions were particularly susceptible to serious illness or death in the event of a COVID-19 infection -- filed this habeas petition and complaint in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Pennsylvania. Represented by the ACLU National Prison Project, ACLU Immigrants’ Rights Project, ACLU of Pennsylvania, and private counsel, the plaintiffs sued the warden of the above-named detention facilities, the acting directors of ICE and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the director of ICE's Philadelphia Field Office. The plaintiffs alleged that the harm posed by continued detention in conditions insufficient to prevent the rapid transmission of COVID-19 violated their substantive due process rights under the Fifth Amendment. They sought a writ of habeas corpus ordering their immediate release or, in the alternative, injunctive relief ordering ICE to release them.  The plaintiffs also sought attorney’s fees and cost and declaratory relief that ""continued detention in civil immigration custody of individuals at increased risk for severe illness, including all people over ages forty-five and older and persons of any age with underlying medical conditions that may increase the risk of serious COVID-19, violates the Due Process Clause."" The case was assigned to Judge John E. Jones.

This complaint was filed in response to the COVID-19 outbreak in the U.S., which caused the state of Pennsylvania to declare a state of emergency. The outbreak resulted in unprecedented public health measures emphasizing and enforcing social distancing throughout the area, including the closure of non-essential businesses and a stay-at-home order for Philadelphia and surrounding counties. However, immigration detention facilities are “congregate environments,” or places where people live and sleep in close proximity and, thus, cannot practice recommended social distancing and good hygiene measures. Given the crowding and lack of adequate medical infrastructure, if COVID-19 were introduced into the detention facilities it would spread easily. The spread of COVID-19 (for which there is no vaccine, known treatment, or cure) would be especially dangerous for detainees over the age of 45 or those with certain underlying health conditions such as lung, heart, and kidney disease--characteristics that the plaintiffs possess. The plaintiffs asserted that ""there is growing recognition among courts and even prison systems that release from detention is the only way to protect vulnerable detainees from COVID-19.""

The plaintiffs asserted that the Fifth Amendment guarantees that civil detainees, including immigrant detainees with criminal backgrounds, may not be subjected to conditions that amount to punishment. The plaintiffs claimed that continued detention in the face of a potential COVID-19 outbreak in the facilities amounts to punishment because it serves no legitimate purpose, is not ""rationally related to the enforcement of immigration laws,"" and ""because their conditions of confinement place them at serious risk of being infected with COVID- 19 and Defendants are being deliberately indifferent to this critical safety concern."" The plaintiffs argued that ICE has the authority to exercise discretion in releasing vulnerable civil immigrant detainees like the plaintiffs and ensure adequate conditions for their release. Lastly, plaintiffs contended that the ""only course of action that can remedy these unlawful conditions is release from the detention centers where risk mitigation is impossible."" 

On the same day, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order (TRO) and/or a preliminary injunction (PI) to enjoin ""Defendants from continuing to detain Plaintiffs in violation of their constitutional rights."" The plaintiffs argued that they are likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim, that they are likely to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a TRO/PI, and that the public interest weighs heavily in favor of a TRO/PI. 

On March 27, the plaintiffs filed a factual update, informing the court that two of the plaintiffs had been released from PCCF.

On March 29, the defendants filed a response and opposition to the plaintiffs' petition for writ of habeas corpus and motion for TRO and/or PI. The defendants claimed that the plaintiffs lack standing, as the ""Petitioners have not alleged that COVID-19 has affirmatively spread to the Pike, York, or Clinton county facilities."" The defendants further argued that a ""petition for habeas relief seeking immediate release is inappropriate in the context of a conditions of confinement claim."" Finally, the defendants asserted that a TRO/PI is inappropriate because the plaintiffs did not establish that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their constitutional claim and that they did not demonstrate irreparable harm. 

On March 31, Judge James issued a memorandum and order granting the plaintiffs' motion for TRO and directing defendants to immediately release plaintiffs that same day. Judge Jones also ordered that by April 7, 2020, the defendants show cause why the TRO should not be converted into a PI. In finding that a TRO was appropriate, Judge James concluded that the plaintiffs had standing to bring their claims despite no confirmed cases of COVID-19 in the facilities; ""'since '[a] remedy for unsafe conditions need not await a tragic event,' it is evident that the Petitioners have standing in this matter."" Judge Jones further found that the plaintiffs had demonstrated irreparable injury, as they ""have shown that adequate measures are not in place and cannot be taken to protect them from COVID-19 in the detention facilities, and that catastrophic results may ensue, both to Petitioners and to the communities surrounding the Facilities."" Judge Jones held that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on the merits of their due process claim; ""[c]onsidering the Facility conditions previously discussed, we can see no rational relationship between a legitimate government objective and keeping Petitioners detained in unsanitary, tightly-packed environments—doing so would constitute a punishment to Petitioners."" 

On April 7, the defendants filed their response to the court's order to show cause. The defendants contended that a habeas petition was not appropriate in this case, as the plaintiffs challenged their conditions of confinement, not the validity of their confinement. The defendants also proclaimed that the evidence demonstrates that ""the Government has taken steps to protect the Petitioners’ safety and the safety of other detainees from prevention, uncontrollable spread, diagnoses, and treatment of COVID-19."" Lastly, the defendants asserted that the balance of equities and public interest favored denying injunctive relief because release is not appropriate due to the plaintiffs' criminal or immigration backgrounds. 

On April 13, Judge Jones issued an order extending the TRO until April 27. Judge Jones stated that this extension was warranted given the worsening situation of the COVID-19 pandemic and to give ""both parties ample opportunity to augment the record before us prior to our decision on the issuance of a preliminary injunction."" 

A few days later, on April 17, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, requesting that the Court ""certify a class of noncitizens at elevated risk of suffering severe health consequences or dying if they contract COVID-19, and to issue expedited relief."" The plainitffs' proposed class was defined as: ""all noncitizens who are now, or will in the future be, detained in ICE custody in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, and who have been diagnosed with, or are receiving treatment for, a preexisting medical condition and/or are over the age of 45."" The plaintiffs asserted that, upon information and belief, ""there are dozens more who are detained at the three ICE facilities who fit the class definition. The class is also fluid as individuals are regularly brought into the facilities as detainees."" The amended complaint also added 11 civil immigrant detainees, who because of their age or underlying health conditions are at a high risk of severe illness or death if they were to contract COVID-19, as plaintiffs. 

On April 27, Judge Jones issued a memorandum and order granting in part and denying in part the plaintiffs' motion to convert the TRO to a preliminary injunction. The preliminary injunction required that three of the named plaintiffs from Pike County Correctional Facility (PCCF) remain released until the end of the COVID-19 State of Emergency in Pennsylvania or social distancing guidelines are lifted. Judge Jones declined to grant the preliminary injunction with regard to plaintiffs from CCCF and YCP and required that they ""voluntarily surrender themselves to the institution from which they were released.""  

As an initial matter, Judge Jones concluded that the plaintiffs could challenge their conditions of confinement through habeas and that the plaintiffs had standing, despite no named plaintiffs having contracted COVID-19. Furthermore, Judge Jones held because the conditions of confinement varied across facilities, only the plaintiffs held at PCCF were likely to succeed on the merits of their due process claim. Judge Jones also found that conditions at YCP and CCCF ""had been adequately improved such that the Petitioners previously housed therein were no longer at risk of irreparable harm resulting from COVID-19."" As of the filing of that order, there had been only one confirmed case between YCP and CCCF. 2020 WL 2025384.

The next day, plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for stay and reconsideration. The plaintiffs presented evidence that one of the plaintiffs who had been ordered to return to detention had been in the hospital for weeks, likely due to contracting COVID-19. The plaintiffs argued that ""the timing of events makes it nearly certain that he contracted the virus while at CCCF."" The same day, Judge Jones granted in part and denied in part the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration. Judge Jones vacated the April 27 order and permitted the continued release for two of the named plaintiffs based on the evidence that they had contracted COVID-19. Judge Jones ordered that those plaintiffs who are asymptomatic return to detention

Later that day, the plaintiffs filed a motion for an emergency stay in the Third Circuit (No. 20-01906) and, in the district court, an emergency motion to stay pending appeal. The plaintiffs argued that the district court had reached an erroneous decision, ""based on an incomplete record, a misunderstanding of the science behind the disease, and legal errors."" The plaintiffs further asserted that the facilities had not conducted an adequate amount of tests to conclude that it was safe to return the plaintiffs to detention. 

The next day, a Third Circuit panel denied the plaintiffs' motion for an emergency stay. The panel did not provide an explanation for its decision.

On May 1, the plaintiffs filed a motion for classwide preliminary injunction. The defendant's filed a motion in opposition on May 22. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss or to strike on June 15, requesting the court dispose of the 6 individual claims brought based on <i>Zadvydas v. Davis</i>. The plaintiffs filed a motion in opposition to this motion on June 22. The Clearinghouse does not have access to these documents, or many of the following documents. 

On June 29, Judge Jones granted the defendants' motion to dismiss the individual claims under <i>Zadvydas</i>, stating that the plaintiffs could separately file individual habeas actions under 28 U.S.C. § 2241.

On July 8, the plaintiffs filed an Emergency Motion for Preliminary Injunction Enjoining Transfers of individual plaintiffs and a corresponding Brief of Support. Defendants moved for a Protective Order on July 13, which was granted in part and denied in part. 

On July 14, the court issued an Order Referring Motion, where the defendants agreed to provide prior notice to plaintiffs' counsel before the transfer of any named class representative or putative class member. The plaintiffs' Emergency Motion for Preliminary Injunction Enjoining Transfers was referred to Magistrate Judge Martin Carlson for any appropriate proceedings, if necessary.

On July 21, the plaintiffs filed an Emergency Motion for Order to Show Cause Why Defendants Should not be Held in Contempt of Court for Violating Order Regarding Transfers. The next day, the court ordered defendants to arrange for direct communication with plaintiffs' counsel within 24 hours regarding transfers without prior notice in violation of the July 14 order. 

On July 29, the plaintiffs filed a Brief in Support of Classwide Preliminary Injunction and Class Certification. 

On August 3, the defendants filed a Brief in Opposition to the plaintiffs' July 21 Emergency Motion for Order to Show Cause Why Defendants Should not be Held in Contempt of Court for Violating Order Regarding Transfers.

On August 4, the defendants filed a Reply Brief to the plaintiffs' July 8 Motion for Preliminary Injunction Enjoining Transfers.

The document at hand, titled ""Release of Immigrant Detainees at High Risk for COVID-19: Case No. 1:20-cv-00480-JEJ: Memorandum and Order on Motion for Preliminary Injunction"", details a legal dispute between a group of immigrant detainees and the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, Chad Wolf, regarding the conditions of their confinement during the COVID-19 pandemic. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the ACLU, ACLU of DC, and Arnold & Porter, are challenging the inadequate measures taken by the defendant to protect them from the virus, including lack of testing, isolation of sick detainees, and release of high-risk individuals. The plaintiffs seek immediate release from detention and appropriate medical care. The court has previously granted a temporary restraining order, releasing ten of the petitioners, and has now considered the plaintiffs' request for a preliminary injunction. After examining the likelihood of success on the merits of their claims and distinguishing between the petitioners housed at different facilities, the court orders the release of certain individuals from detention and places them under orders of supervision.

PR-MI-0002,"COVID-19 Summary: Three residents of Michigan sued Governor Whitmer, challenging that an Executive Order issued to combat the spread of COVID-19, which required residents to stay home and suspend non-essential activity and business, violated their Equal Protection, Due Process, and First and Second Amendment constitutional rights. On April 24, the defendant issued an executive order permitting the activities that the plaintiffs alleged were unconstitutionally prohibited. The motion for preliminary injunction was dismissed as moot, however, the plaintiffs filed an amended motion on April 28. <hr>

On April 15, 2020, three Michigan residents, two owning cottages in the state and one owning a landscaping business, filed this complaint in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the Governor of the State of Michigan and three county prosecuting attorneys, in their official capacities, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and Michigan state law. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Freedom Law Center, challenged Michigan's Executive Order 2020-42, which ordered all people in Michigan to stay home and suspended activities deemed unnecessary to sustain or protect life. The plaintiffs sought relief declaring that the enactment and enforcement of Executive Order 2020-42 violated ""their fundamental liberties and rights secured by the United States and Michigan Constitutions and an order enjoining the same."" The plaintiffs also sought attorneys' fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Maloney.

On April 9, 2020, Executive Order 2020-42 was enacted in response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan; as of April 8, Michigan reported 20,346 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 959 deaths from it. The order directed all Michigan residents to stay home, subject to exceptions for exercise and obtaining services or supplies, prohibited ""all public and private gatherings of any number of people occurring among persons not part of a single household,"" and required that ""no person or entity shall operate a business or conduct operations that require workers to leave their homes or places of residence except to the extent that those workers are necessary to sustain or protect life or to conduct minimum basic operations."" The order was put in place with the goal of suppressing the spread of COVID-19, preventing the state's health care system from being overwhelmed, and allowing time for the production of test kits, ventilators, and personal protective equipment. It was set to stay in effect until April 30, 2020. 

The plaintiffs claimed that the Executive Order violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, arguing it lacked any rational basis and deprived plaintiffs of their ""fundamental rights and freedom,"" such as the right to travel to their cottages, conduct landscaping business, and travel to purchase ammunition, ""yet the order provides exceptions for other activity and conduct that is similar in its impact and effects."" Moreover, the plaintiffs asserted that the Executive Order violated their right to Due Process under the Fourteenth Amendment, as it deprived plaintiffs of ""the use and enjoyment of their property without due process"" and because ""it broadly prohibits Plaintiffs . . . from traveling through public spaces and roadways to their cottages, and yet the executive order permits other travel with the same impact and effect of Plaintiffs’ forbidden travel."" Furthermore, the plaintiffs asserted that the Executive Order violated their ""right to contract without government interference,"" their right to keep and bear arms, and their right to ""associate with others in pursuit of a wide variety of political, social, economic, educational, religious, and cultural ends.""

On April 20, the plaintiffs sought a motion for temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, and asked for an order temporarily enjoining enforcement of Executive Order 2020-42 pending a hearing on whether a preliminary injunction should issue. 

On April 24, 2020, the defendant issued Executive Order 2020-59, which permits: individuals to travel between their own residences and cottages within the State of Michigan, the operation of landscaping businesses within the State of Michigan, outdoor activities that include using boats with motors for recreational purposes, the sale of guns from any store via remote order and curbside pick-up, and the sale of guns in-store from stores that sell necessary supplies as well as guns in their normal course of business, and exempts from penalty religious gatherings at private residences. 

On April 26, the plaintiffs stated that the requested relief is no longer necessary because the stipulation rendered the TRO and PI motion is moot. The next day, the court dismissed the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction.

On April 28, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint, claiming that while stipulation remedied the immediate harm, it did not resolve the constitutional issues presented. The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May 20, arguing that the plaintiffs' claims had become moot due to the series of executive orders that permitted the activities that the amended complaint alleged were prohibited. They further argued that the State had the broad authority to implement emergency measures during an emergency.

The document being analyzed, titled ""Order Granting Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction,"" is a court order in the case of Roman Kaplan and City Arms East LLC v. County of Los Angeles et al. The plaintiffs, Roman Kaplan and City Arms East LLC, are represented by attorneys from the law firm Michel and Associates, P.C. They filed an injunction against three counties in California, arguing that the orders restricting access to indoor shooting ranges due to the COVID-19 pandemic violated their Second Amendment rights. On the other hand, the defendants, the County of Los Angeles, the County of Ventura, and the County of San Bernardino, are represented by attorneys from the Los Angeles County Counsel's Office and the California Attorney General's Office. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants' orders, which restricted access to indoor shooting ranges, violated their Second Amendment rights. Specifically, they argued that the orders were not narrowly tailored enough to withstand intermediate scrutiny, and that they were denied due process. The plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunction to block the enforcement of the orders and allow them to operate their indoor shooting ranges.

IM-CA-0171,"On November 2, 2020, asylum seekers with disabilities and health conditions filed this putative class-action suit against the Department of Homeland Security and U.S. Customs and Border Protection in the Southern District of California. The suit alleged that defendants violated the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by forcibly returning plaintiffs to Mexico under the Migrant Protection Protocols (the “MPP”). Under the MPP, asylum seekers entering the United States from Mexico were returned to Mexico and waited outside the U.S. for the duration of their immigration proceedings. The plaintiffs stated that MPP conflicted with CBP’s own procedure at the time that asylum seekers with “known physical or mental health issues” cannot be sent to Mexico. They alleged that DHS failed to put in place effective methods to ensure that people with known physical or mental health conditions were exempt from MPP and to identify and assess, for accommodations, immigrants with disabilities. The plaintiffs sought an order enjoining the defendants from continuing forcible removal of class members under MPP and requiring the defendants to put in place practices and procedures in compliance with Section 504. They also requested attorneys’ fees. The plaintiffs were represented by the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center, Texas Civil Rights Project, and private counsel. The case was assigned to Judge Todd W. Robinson and Magistrate Judge Bernard G. Skomal.

On December 22, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to stay pending the appeal of a separate case. The judge denied the motion on February 19, 2021. There were joint motions to continue on March 2, 2021. 

On December 23, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction. They requested that defendants stop subjecting members of the putative class to the MPP. They further requested that defendants put in place mechanisms ensuring CBP’s protocols of exempting those with known physical or mental health issues was being carried out, that family members of the putative class were also excluded pursuant to the Family Unit Policy, and that defendants put in place practices and policies to identify immigrants with disabilities and provide accommodations necessary for those with disabilities to prepare for their asylum proceedings. On the same day, the plaintiffs also filed a motion requesting class certification for asylum seekers with disabilities and their family members.

The document, titled ""Class Action Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief,"" was filed by a group of individuals and their families against Betsy DeVos, the United States Department of Education, and Caroline Hynes. The plaintiffs, represented by a team of attorneys from organizations such as Al Otro Lado, include individuals with disabilities, children, and families who have been subjected to the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP) policy. They allege that the defendants have violated their own policies by forcing them to remain in Mexico while their immigration cases are being decided. This has resulted in exposure to violence, exploitation, and lack of access to essential medical care and legal representation for the plaintiffs. The attorneys involved in this case include representatives from organizations such as the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Immigration Law Center. The court proceedings include a request for plaintiffs to proceed anonymously due to threats and potential retaliation, as well as a pending pro hac vice application.

NS-CA-0007,"Plaintiffs, foreign nationals, filed suit in May 2007 in United States District Court for the Northern District of California against Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., a subsidiary of Boeing Company, for its participation in a U.S. extraordinary rendition program operated by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) that apprehended, transported, imprisoned, interrogated, and, in some instances, tortured the plaintiffs. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, plaintiffs brought action under the Alien Tort Statute, 28 U.S.C. § 1350, alleging that Jeppesen provided flight planning and logistical support of the extraordinary rendition of plaintiffs, with knowledge that its involvement would lead to unlawful apprehension, detention, and possible torture.

In October 2007, the United States moved to intervene and moved to dismiss the case, asserting the ""states secret"" privilege. Then-director of the CIA, General Michael Hayden, filed declarations in support of the motion to dismiss, asserting that disclosure of information could cause serious or grave damage to national security. After conducting a hearing, the district court granted the motion to intervene and to dismiss. Mohamed v. Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., 539 F. Supp. 2d 1128 (N.D. Cal. 2008).

Plaintiffs immediately appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit remanded the case, ruling that the states secret privilege in this context operated only as an evidentiary privilege, the exact parameters of which were indeterminate until plaintiffs made an actual request for discovery of specific evidence. Mohamed v. Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., 563 F. 3d 992 (9th Cir. 2009), amended by 579 F. 3d 943 (9th Cir. 2009).

Meanwhile, Barack Obama succeeded George W. Bush as President of the United States. His administration announced new policies for invoking the states secrets privilege and reviewed the assertion of privilege in this case. Government then requested the Ninth Circuit for a rehearing en banc, which the court granted. Mohamed v. Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., 586 F.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2009). 

Upon rehearing, an eleven judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court order of dismissal. Even though plaintiff's prima facie case and Jeppesen's defenses may not have depended on privileged evidence, the court found that ""the facts underlying plaintiffs' claims are so infused with state secrets, "" there was ""no feasible way to litigate Jeppesen's alleged liability without creating an unjustifiable risk of divulging state secrets."" Mohamed v. Jeppesen DataPlan, Inc., 614 F.3d 1070, 1088, 1087 (9th Cir. 2010). The Ninth Circuit then noted possible nonjudicial relief, including government-provided reparations, a Congressional investigation and legislation restraining the executive branch, Congressional legislation enacting a private bill, and Congressional legislation enacting remedial schemes to address claims like plaintffs'.

This document is a compilation of summaries from various segments of a legal case, Mohamed v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc., which was brought before the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals in 2010. The case involved a lawsuit filed by five foreign nationals against Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc., a subsidiary of Boeing Corporation, for their alleged involvement in the United States' Extraordinary Rendition Program. The plaintiffs, Binyam Mohamed, Abou Elkassim Britel, Ahmed Agiza, Mohamed Farag Ahmad Bashmilah, and Bisher al-Rawi, were all victims of this program, which involved the CIA secretly apprehending and transferring suspected terrorists to other countries for interrogation and detention, where they were subjected to severe torture and inhumane treatment. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), sought damages for their physical and psychological suffering, as well as declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent further support for the program. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc. was accused of knowingly and willingly assisting in the transportation of individuals to countries where they would be subjected to torture. The case was dismissed by the district court, but on appeal, a divided court affirmed the dismissal under the state secrets privilege.",0.6349,0.2597,0.3687,0.2394,0.0976,0.1387,0.2857,0.1169,0.1659
EE-GU-0001,"On September 29, 2006, the Los Angeles District Office of the EEOC brought this suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of Guam. The plaintiff sued Leo Palace Resort under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The plaintiff, representing female employees of Leo Palace Resort, asked the court for permanent injunctive relief, a requirement of policy changes at defendant's company, and monetary damages. The plaintiffs claimed that the defendant engaged in unlawful employment practices by subjecting female employees to sexual harassment and by retaliating against employees for complaining of discrimination. Specifically, three female employees alleged that they experienced frequent sexual harassment from a coworker in the form of physical touching, requests for sex, and inappropriate gestures. When the employees complained the defendant employer retaliated by reducing their hours, taking disciplinary action, and failing to keep their complaints confidential. Two employees were constructively discharged as a result. 

The complainants intervened in the EEOC's suit and the defendant moved to dismiss their claims and moved for summary judgment. The summary judgment motion was denied and the motion to dismiss was denied as premature. The parties engaged in discovery for the next year, and agreed to have a hearing date without oral argument. 

On September 10, 2007, the defendants again filed for partial summary judgment, arguing that this was only a question of negligence on behalf of the company in response to complaints of its employee, and not a sexual harassment suit. 

On March 13, 2008, before the court had heard the motion for partial summary judgment, the parties parties jointly submitted a consent decree. 

On March 21, 2008 Judge Frances M. Tydingco-Gatewood approved the consent decree. The agreement required the defendant to pay the complainants a total of $243,000. It also required the defendant to create an anti-discrimination policy; institute a complaint procedure; hire an outside consultant to ensure compliance with the decree; post and distribute a notice of equal opportunity employment rights; and conduct annual training for all employees. On May 8, 2008 the case was dismissed with prejudice.

The document ""EEOC Litigation Statistics: FY 2008"" provides a thorough analysis of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's (EEOC) enforcement and litigation efforts during the fiscal year 2008. It includes summaries of various cases involving discrimination and retaliation claims under statutes such as Title VII, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA), and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). One notable case is EEOC v. Allstate Life Ins. Co., where the EEOC sued Allstate for requiring employees to sign a release in order to continue working, which was deemed a violation of anti-retaliation provisions. The case was consolidated with a private class action lawsuit, with the EEOC arguing that the employees who refused to sign the release were engaging in protected ""participation"" under retaliation provisions. In another significant case, Crawford v. Metropolitan Gov't of Nashville & Davidson County, TN, the plaintiff claimed he was fired in retaliation for his fiancée filing an EEOC charge against their employer, North American Stainless.

CJ-WA-0001,"On February 2, 1996, a group of African-Americans, Hispanic-Americans, and Native-Americans having felony convictions filed a pro se action in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, claiming that the state of Washington's felon disenfranchisement scheme violated the Voting Rights Act (""VRA""), 42 U.S.C. § 1971 et seq., and the First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Ninth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  The state constitution made persons convicted of an ""infamous crime"" (generally, a felony) ineligible to vote.  Because, according to the plaintiffs' allegations, minorities were disproportionately prosecuted and sentenced, they were disproportionately represented among the persons disenfranchised under the Washington constitution.  The plaintiffs alleged that the resultant race-based vote denial and vote dilution violated the VRA and the federal constitution.

District Judge Robert H. Whaley granted the plaintiffs' motion for appointment of counsel, resulting in the plaintiffs being represented by private attorneys and counsel from University Legal Assistance.  Subsequently, counsel amended the complaint, adding a plaintiff, retaining the VRA violation claim, and modifying the list of federal constitutional amendments allegedly violated to include the First, Second, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, Eighth, Fourteenth, and Fifteenth Amendments.  The defendants filed a motion to dismiss.  Judge Whaley denied the motion in part, saying that the VRA could be proven to be violated by a vote disenfranchisement scheme that results in vote denial based upon race, as the plaintiffs had alleged.  The claims of vote dilution in violation of the VRA and of constitutional violations were too conclusory or unsupported, in the judge's view, leading him to dismiss those components of the complaint for failure to state a claim upon which relief could be granted.  Farrakhan v. Locke, 987 F. Supp. 1304 (E.D. Wash. 1997).

On October 26, 1999, plaintiffs filed another amended complaint, making the same claims of racial discrimination against their voting rights but adding causes of action based upon alleged denial of the right to vote due to nonpayment of legal financial obligations, which the plaintiffs said constituted a denial due to a previous condition of servitude, and upon a claimed denial of due process stemming from the allegedly vague and unduly burdensome statutory process in Washington for an offender to gain restoration of voting rights.  The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief, damages, and attorneys' fees and costs.

Judge Whaley granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment and denied the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment in an unpublished order on December 1, 2000.  Although the judge found that the disenfranchisement provision had a clear disproportionate impact on racial minorities, he said the plaintiffs could not show a causal relationship between the disenfranchisement and the result prohibited by the VRA.  Neither was there any evidence that the disenfranchisement provision was motivated by racial animus or that its operation, by itself, had a discriminatory effect.  In the judge's view, discrimination in the criminal justice system may show a flaw in that system, but that is different than proving a flaw with the disenfranchisement system.  The totality of the circumstances failed to establish a causal link between Washington's felon disenfranchisement provision and reduced minority access to the state's political process.  The court also rejected the challenge to the state's restoration of civil rights process, saying that the plaintiffs allegations failed to establish their standing to make such claims (i.e., they did not show that they were eligible to or had sought restoration) and, even had they shown standing, they had produced no evidence that something in the restoration process made restoration difficult or impossible because of race.

The plaintiffs appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.  (Amicus curiae briefs supporting the plaintiffs were filed by attorneys with the ACLU of Washington, the Brennan Center for Justice, and the Lawyers' Committee for Civil Rights Under Law.)  A panel of the that court agreed with Judge Whaley that a claim of vote denial due to felon disenfranchisement is cognizable under Section 2 of the VRA, that the state disenfranchisement law did not violate the VRA, and that the plaintiffs lacked standing to challenge the state's restoration of rights process; however, the appellate court reversed the district judge on his analysis of whether the totality of the circumstances established unlawful racial discrimination and denial of minority voting rights as the effect of the disenfranchisement provision.  Specifically, Circuit Judge Richard A. Paez wrote, the district court should not have excluded from its' analysis evidence of racial bias in the criminal justice system, because precedent requires examination of how a challenged voting system interacts with external factors such as social and historical conditions to result (or not) in the denial of the right to vote on account of race or color.  The court remanded the case for the district court to make factual findings assessing the totality of the circumstances, including plaintiffs' evidence of racial bias in the state's criminal justice system.  Farrakhan v. Washington, 338 F.3d 1009 (9th Cir. 2003).  Before the remand, however, the appellate court considered whether to hear the matter en banc.  A majority of the active judges did not vote for en banc review, so none occurred, but judges favoring rehearing filed a lengthy dissent calling the panel opinion a questionable interpretation of the VRA, potentially destructive of the VRA, and wrongly based upon plaintiffs' evidence of statistical disparities in the criminal process when studies based on such disparities are ""notoriously unreliable.""  Farrakhan v. Washington, 339 F.3d 1116 (9th Cir. 2004) (Circuit Judge Alex Kozinski, dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc).  The state failed in its' effort to have the U.S. Supreme Court grant a writ of certiorari to review the case.  Locke v. Farrakhan, 543 U.S. 984 (2004).

When the case finally returned to the district court, the parties filed a joint status report advising that several months of discovery proceeding were anticipated, that a fifth amended complaint was contemplated, as was a motion for class certification, and that cross-motions for summary judgment would be forthcoming.  Accordingly, the parties asked that the trial setting be for no earlier than March 2006.

Cross-motions for summary judgment were eventually filed and, in an unpublished order on July 7, 2006, Judge Whaley granted the state's while denying the plaintiffs'.  While he continued to find plaintiffs' statistical evidence of racial bias in Washington's criminal justice system ""compelling"" and a factor which interacts with the state's disenfranchisement law in a meaningful way, the judge concluded that the multiple other factors relevant to analysis under a totality of the circumstances test counterbalanced the discriminatory effects resulting from the functioning of the state's criminal justice system.

The plaintiffs appealed for the second time to the Ninth Circuit in December 2006.  After oral argument, Washington law was changed to provide that the voting rights of felons will be ""provisionally restored,"" at such time as those convicted under Washington state law are no longer under the authority of the Washington Department of Corrections, and, as to those convicted under federal law or in any other state, they are not in custody. See Wash. Laws of 2009, ch. 325, HB 1517.  The Circuit Court determined the new law had no effect on the case but to moot the claims of one plaintiff who was no longer in custody.  The Court reversed the lower court decision, holding that Plaintiffs have demonstrated that the discriminatory impact of Washington's felon disenfranchisement is attributable to racial discrimination in Washington's criminal justice system and remanded with instructions to grant summary judgment to plaintiffs. 

On October 7, 2010, the en banc Ninth Circuit overturned the panel decision, holding that a state can prohibit felons from voting even if the ban disproportionately harms minorities.  The court found that plaintiffs had not shown ""that their convictions and resulting disenfranchisement resulted from intentional racial discrimination in the operation of the state's criminal justice system.

As of March 24, 2012 there has been no additional action in this case.

Farrakhan v. Locke, also known as Locke v. Farrakhan, was a pivotal legal case that reached the United States Supreme Court in 2004. At its core, it revolved around a challenge to Washington state's felon disenfranchisement law, which barred individuals convicted of felonies from exercising their right to vote. The plaintiffs, Muhammad Shabazz Farrakhan, Al-Kareem Shadeed, and George Mitchell, were represented by a team of attorneys from the ACLU and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. They alleged that the law violated the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution, as it disproportionately affected racial minorities and was a direct result of discriminatory sentencing practices.

On the other side, the defendants were Governor Gary Locke and Secretary of State Ralph Munro, who were represented by attorneys from the Office of the Attorney General. The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the law was unconstitutional, an injunction to prevent its enforcement, and damages. Initially, the district court dismissed most of the claims, but upon appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals remanded the case for further consideration.

As the case proceeded, the plaintiffs presented statistical evidence, expert declarations, and reports to support their claim of discrimination in the criminal justice system and the discriminatory",0.7794,0.118,0.2049,0.3202,0.0483,0.0839,0.4461,0.0675,0.1173
IM-CA-0108,"Two refugees whose families fled Cambodia in the 1970s filed this class action lawsuit, challenging U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) for arbitrarily and unlawfully detaining them. The plaintiffs represented other Cambodian refugees living in the U.S. since escaping the violence of the Khmer Rouge regime. The plaintiffs argued that ICE violated the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) by unlawfully revoking their release from its custody and detaining them when removal was not reasonably foreseeable and without individualized determinations of danger and flight risk. The plaintiffs sought habeas, declaratory, and injunctive relief. Represented by Asian Americans Advancing Justice and a private law firm, the plaintiffs filed this case on October 27, 2017, in the U.S. District Court for the Central District of California.

The complaint sought to declare a class of approximately 1,900 individuals. The plaintiffs stated that all class members escaped the Khmer Rouge regime and its ""campaign of mass murder and torture"" in Cambodia in the 1970s when they were young children. They had lived in the United States ever since, growing up ""in communities in crisis...struggl[ing] with unaddressed trauma, poverty, and violence-ridden neighborhoods, with almost no culturally competent resources to address their needs."" Class members ""made mistakes in their youth,"" which led to involvement in the criminal justice system, loss of their Lawful Permanent Resident (LPR) status, and removal proceedings. However, ICE subsequently released the class members after Cambodia disallowed repatriation. ICE allowed the class members to return to their communities but required them to regularly report back to demonstrate they were complying with the conditions of their release. Many of these class members established families in the U.S.

The complaint stated that, as of October 2016, Cambodia suspended a 2002 repatriation agreement with the U.S. A year later, following a U.S. government freeze on further tourist visas to Cambodians until Cambodia agreed to aid the U.S. in removing Cambodian refugees, ICE began raiding Cambodian refugee homes and workplaces. The plaintiffs asserted that ICE conducted these raids ""without cause and without providing procedural protections required by law . . . [and] without any evidence that Cambodia would now accept their repatriation."" Further, the plaintiffs argued that they ""received no adequate explanation of the reasons for detention, no opportunity to be heard regarding any purported reasons for detention, and no individualized consideration before a neutral decisionmaker regarding whether they pose a danger or flight risk that could warrant detention.""

On October 30, the case was assigned to Judge Cormac J. Carney.

On December 12, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. They also filed for a temporary restraining order (TRO) as to the removal of plaintiffs scheduled to begin on December 18, arguing that because they only had learned that removal proceedings were to commence on December 7, they needed the TRO so that they could have an opportunity to reopen and challenge their orders of removal. These documents are not publicly available.

Judge Carney granted the TRO on December 14. While the amended complaint is not publicly available, it appears that the complaint sought to define a class ""on behalf of approximately 1,900 individuals who received orders of removal to Cambodia but were subsequently released from custody and have since been living in the United States."" 

Judge Carney granted a preliminary injunction on January 25, 2018. 306 F. Supp. 3d 1147 (C.D. Cal. 2018). He enjoined the government from executing final removal orders as to the plaintiffs and a subclass of 92 putative class members who received or were being considered for travel papers. The injunction prevented final removal orders until February 5, 2018. Judge Carney held that denying an injunction ""amounts to a denial of due process"" because while removal orders for many of the plaintiffs have been dormant for over a decade, ""[c]ircumstances have changed in the interim that may allow Petitioners to raise serious questions regarding the validity of their underlying convictions and removal orders."" 

On February 8, the government moved to dismiss the case; the plaintiffs responded on March 2, and the government replied on March 12. 

On February 23, the plaintiffs moved to relate this case to <i><a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16464"">Trinh v. Homan</a></i>, a case challenging ICE's detention of Vietnamese refugees stripped of their LPR status due to criminal convictions. On March 14, Judge Carney granted plaintiffs' motion to relate the cases.

On March 19, the plaintiffs moved for another preliminary injunction and class certification. Meanwhile, the defendants appealed Judge Carney's January 25 preliminary injunction to the Ninth Circuit, which opened a new docket (No. 18-55389).

After a March 26 hearing, Judge Carney denied the government's motion to dismiss, and granted the plaintiffs' habeas claim. 2018 WL 1941756 (C.D. Cal.). First, Judge Carney held that the Court had jurisdiction over the habeas petition and due process claim, because plaintiffs challenged not the removal order itself but the legality of the detention. Judge Carney then ordered plaintiff released from ICE custody, finding his arrest, detention, and threatened deportation unlawful. 

Judge Carney wrote:
<blockquote>Chhoeun poses no danger to the community. Prior to ICE’s wrongful re-detention of him, he was living peaceably in the community for the past fourteen years. He was gainfully employed. He had built strong ties to his family and his community. The Government simply had no justification to take away, without due process, Chhoeun’s liberty to carry out his life. . . . The Government’s argument [that an person subject to an order of removal lacks due process rights] trivializes, indeed ignores, fundamental principles of liberty and due process embedded in our Constitution. . . . And due process demands that the Government consider the totality of an individual’s circumstances before taking away his or her liberty. <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=16434"">Ragbir v. Sessions</a>. . . . The Government’s position, which would do away with any individualized consideration before taking away someone’s liberty, is repugnant to due process.</blockquote>
On April 12, Judge Carney rejected the proposed class definition because a class consisting of 13 members was not numerous enough. 

On May 11, 2018, certain defendants moved for dismissal for lack of jurisdiction. On June 4, 2018, Judge Carney denied the motion without prejudice. On May 24, 2018, the government appealed the March 26 order denying their motion to dismiss.

On July 2, 2018, the plaintiffs again moved to certify the class, which the district court approved on August 14, 2018. Judge Carney certified the following class: ""All Cambodian nationals in the United States who received final orders of deportation or removal, and were subsequently released from ICE custody, and have not subsequently violated any criminal laws or conditions of their release, and have been or may be re-detained for removal by ICE.""

Back at the Ninth Circuit, on December 7, 2018, the government moved to voluntarily dismiss their March 23 appeal of Judge Carney’s preliminary injunction. Voluntary dismissal of this appeal was granted on December 11, 2018. 2018 Us App Lexis 34850 (9th Cir. Dec. 11, 2018). 

On December 31, 2018, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order, enjoining the government from re-detaining any class member without notice. The plaintiffs alleged that the government had conducted two raids since the raid involving the plaintiffs, detaining many class members in the process. They had received credible information suggesting that another raid was forthcoming and had requested the government to provide class members with notice, which it refused to do without a court order. Judge Carney granted the TRO on January 3, 2019, requiring the government to give at least fourteen days’ notice before re-detaining any class member. Judge Carney also ordered the government to show cause as to why a preliminary injunction should not issue in light of the TRO.

The government then successfully requested an extended period of time to file its opening brief in its second appeal, that of Judge Carney’s March 26 denial of the government’s motion to dismiss. However, shortly thereafter, the government similarly moved to voluntarily dismiss this appeal. The Ninth Circuit granted that dismissal. 2019 Us App Lexis 9447 (9th Cir. Mar. 29, 2019). 

Back in the district court, on April 10, 2019, Judge Carney vacated the order to show cause in light of the parties’ stipulation. He ordered the parties to make a good faith effort to settle the case before proceeding with their respective motions for summary judgment, but set a briefing schedule in the event that they do not. Deadlines for briefing were set for September through November of 2019. To effectuate a settlement, the court assigned a mediator on October 15, 2019.

However, the parties did not reach a settlement and proceeded to summary judgment. The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on October 23, 2019. The defendants likewise filed a cross-motion for summary judgment on January 9, 2020. On March 4, 2020, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and denied defendants' cross-motion for summary judgment. 442 F. Supp. 3d 1233. The court reasoned that the plaintiffs held a compelling liberty interest in remaining in the United States where they had lives and families; that there would be a high risk of erroneous deprivation of that liberty interest and thus a high value in giving notice to the potential detainee; and that there were few burdens or interests that supported not giving notice before re-detaining the plaintiffs. Thus, the court concluded that notice was fundamental to protecting the plaintiffs' due process rights. 

The court on March 20, 2020, ordered the parties to file a joint permanent injunction proposal. On April 27, 2020, the court entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiffs and further ordered a permanent injunction that enjoined ICE from re-detaining any member of the class without first giving two weeks' written notice.

Langley v. Coughlin is a class action lawsuit filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The document at hand, J.R. v. Barr, is a collection of individual summaries from this larger lawsuit. The plaintiffs, represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and other immigrant rights organizations, are individuals who have been or will be subjected to the Customs and Border Protection's policies of turnbacks and metering at ports of entry along the U.S.-Mexico border. These include asylum-seekers who have been denied access to the asylum process at ports of entry and were either turned back or subjected to metering by CBP officials. The defendants in this case are the Acting Commissioner of CBP, Mark Morgan, and the Acting Director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, Ken Cuccinelli. 

The plaintiffs allege that the defendants have systematically and intentionally impeded, discouraged, and deterred asylum seekers from accessing the U.S. asylum process at ports of entry, in violation of the Immigration and Nationality Act and the Administrative Procedure Act. They claim that the defendants have used various tactics, such as misinformation and coercion, to deny noncitizens access to the asylum process.

PN-IL-0009,"On March 15, 2001, the Chicago civil rights law firm Loevy & Loevy filed a civil rights lawsuit pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, seeking damages on behalf of plaintiff Joseph Lopez for alleged constitutional violations stemming from his arrest in July 2000 by Chicago police for a murder he did not commit.  Plaintiff alleged that after he was taken into custody in shooting death of a 12-year old girl, he was held by Chicago police in a in a nine-by-seven-foot interrogation room for four days, handcuffed to a ring on the wall.  He alleged he was deprived of sleep, beaten and threatened in an attempt to coerce him into a confessing to the murder.  Ultimately, Lopez gave a false confession, which he later recanted.  The confession did not match did not match the forensic evidence from the crime scene.  On the fifth day of his detention, police charged Lopez with murder and held a press conference to announce the charges.  That same day, a different man, Miguel Figueroa was arrested and confessed to the child's murder.  The charges against Lopez were dropped and this lawsuit followed.

Plaintiff's suit alleged Section 1983 claims against the City of Chicago and several detectives and police officers for excessive force, unlawful detention, police torture, and conspiracy in violation of the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. He also brought supplemental state law claims.  The defendants denied all allegations and the City moved to bifurcate the Section 1983 claims against it from the claims against the individuals officers to stay discovery against the City until after discovery against the individual officers was concluded.  The District Court (Judge Darrah) denied the request for bifurcation, but ordered that discovery against the City be stayed pending later reassessment. Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2002 WL 335346,  2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 3458 (N.D.Ill. Mar 01, 2002).

Plaintiff then moved to amend his complaint to add class action claims to reform an unconstitutional Chicago Police Department practice known as the ""hold past court call"" procedure. Plaintiff alleged that this procedure allowed police to continue investigating and interrogating recent arrestees without taking them before a judicial official for a determination of probable cause.  The District Court (Judge Darrah) granted the motion over defendants' objections.  Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2002 WL 31415767, 2002 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 20613 (N.D.Ill. Oct 25, 2002).  Plaintiff filed his second amended complaint with class allegations on November 12, 2002.  Discovery continued.

The District Court granted summary judgment on several claims against the two police officers who initially arrested plaintiff.  Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2004 WL 725790,  2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 5371  (N.D.Ill. Mar 31, 2004).   Plaintiff decided to withdrew his request for class certification and the case proceeded on plaintiff's claims against the remaining defendants.

Note that after dropping the class action claims, plaintiff's attorneys, Loevy & Loevy, filed a separate class action lawsuit on October 21, 2004, challenging the detention practices of the Chicago Police Department.  That suit was styled Dunn v. City of Chicago [See PN-IL-0008 of this collection]

Following pre-trial motions, see Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2005 WL 563212 (N.D.Ill. Mar 08, 2005), the case proceeded to trial against the remaining individual defendants.  After 7 days of testimony, the District Court (Judge Deryeghiayan) refused to submit the majority of plaintiff's claims (claims for unlawful extended detention, unlawful conditions of confinement intention infliction of emotional distress) to the jury for deliberation and ruled that defendants were entitled to judgment as a matter of law.  The only claims to go to the jury were the excessive force and assault and battery claims against Officer Gomez, who allegedly punched plaintiff when driving him to the station for questioning. The jury found in favor of Officer Gomez.  Lopez v. City of Chicago, 2005 WL 711986, 2005 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 6160 (N.D.Ill. Mar 23, 2005) Plaintiff appealed.  The Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded.  Lopez v. City of Chicago, 464 F.3d 711 (7th Cir.  2006). The Appeals Court found that Lopez was entitled to judgment as a matter of law on his unlawful detention claim and that the trial court should have submitted the police torture and intentional infliction of emotional distress claims to the jury.

On remand, the case was settled on terms that were not made public.  Under the settlement, plaintiff's attorneys petitioned the Court for an award of attorney's fees.  The District Court (Judge Elaine E. Bucklo) awarded plaintiff $819,577.00 in fees, $11,537.12 for taxable expenses and $26,905.68 for non-taxable expenses.   Lopez v.

This document, titled Lopez v. City of Chicago, is a compilation of individual summaries from various segments of the case. In this civil rights lawsuit, plaintiff Joseph Lopez, represented by attorneys Jon Loevy and Michael Kanovitz, filed a complaint against the City of Chicago and various Chicago Police Department officers. The lawsuit alleged that Lopez and a group of individuals were subjected to excessive force, false arrest, and malicious prosecution by the defendants, in violation of their constitutional rights. The plaintiffs sought monetary damages and injunctive relief, including a change in police policies and training. The court proceedings began with the defendants raising objections to the plaintiff's counsel's billing, which were mostly ruled in favor of the plaintiff. The court also considered the degree of success obtained by the plaintiffs, as well as the significance of the case, in determining the reasonable hourly rates for the plaintiff's attorneys. The defendants attempted to argue for a lower rate, but were unsuccessful. The court also struck some entries that involved duplicative efforts or clerical tasks. After several motions and appeals, the final verdict was reached in favor of the plaintiffs, resulting in a settlement between the parties.

FA-IL-0016,"On March 30, 2017, an organization called Tent City Alternative to LSD Viaducts and a community resident activist submitted a Notification of Public Assembly to the City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings. They requested a permit to erect tents on behalf of the homeless population, who would be displaced by construction. The City granted a permit as to the location for the duration sought, but without a provision that would allow the erection of tents. On May 17, the plaintiffs responded by filing a lawsuit in the Circuit Court of Cook County.  

On June 15, 2017, the defendant City of Chicago removed the action to the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The case was assigned to Judge Sidney Schenkier. In September, the court granted a motion to change the name of the plaintiffs to The Uptown Tent City Organizers. The Uptown Tent City Organizers is an unincorporated association of community members, some of whom reside in tents under the viaducts near Lake Shore Drive. 

On August 1, the plaintiffs filed a first amended complaint under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201 and 2202 against the Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings, Chicago Department of Transportation, and City of Chicago. The first amended complaint claimed that denial of the permit to erect tents violated the plaintiffs' First Amendment rights to public assembly, Eighth Amendment rights against cruel and unusual punishment, and rights under state law. The plaintiffs sought a reversal of the city's decision to deny the permit (granting the application for an assembly permit to run for a period of six months), declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees and costs.

On August 27, the plaintiffs requested a preliminary injunction to prevent the construction work from occurring that would displace the homeless community. On September 15, Judge Sidney I. Schenkier denied the motion on the basis that the government did not have the constitutional obligation to provide individuals with a place to live and the community did not have a contractual right to live under the viaducts.

On November 7, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint to add federal constitutional violations under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments and a state claim of violation of the Illinois Homeless Act. The amended complaint included details of events that precipitated in September between the plaintiffs and local law enforcement. The plaintiffs again sought a reversal of the administrative hearing decision to deny the permits, declaratory relief, a permanent injunction, and attorney's fees and costs. 

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss on January 19, 2018. Judge Schenkier granted this motion and dismissed the case with prejudice on June 5, 2018. The court held that the organization lacked standing because it failed to allege that any of its members would be personally harmed by the City's conduct. And the court dismissed the individual plaintiff's First Amendment claim because the plaintiff had not alleged that the proposed conduct would be expressive. Finally, the court declined to exercise jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims. 2018 WL 2709431.

This document, titled ""Uptown Tent City Organizers et al v. City of Chicago Department of Administrative Hearings et al,"" provides a comprehensive overview of a legal dispute between a group of homeless individuals and the City of Chicago. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys Alan S. Mills and Sandra Mullin, alleged that the city had violated their constitutional rights by denying their request to erect tents in a park for homeless individuals to reside in. They also challenged the city's decision to close the Wilson and Lawrence Avenue viaducts, preventing them from setting up tents in the area. The defendants, represented by attorneys from the City of Chicago and its Department of Administrative Hearings and Department of Transportation, argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring their claims and that the city's decisions were reasonable and not in violation of their rights. The plaintiffs sought a reversal of the city's decisions and a declaration that the city's policies were unconstitutional, while the defendants sought a dismissal of the case. The attorneys involved in the case included representatives from the plaintiffs' organization and pro bono attorneys, as well as attorneys from the city's departments. The court proceedings included an administrative hearing and a motion for summary judgment, with the final verdict resulting in the dismissal of most claims but allowing",0.7067,0.3046,0.4257,0.2634,0.1132,0.1584,0.3689,0.159,0.2222
EE-NV-0004,"The Los Angeles district office of the EEOC brought this suit against Caesar's Entertainment, Inc., a major casino corporation, and related corporate entities in March 2005 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Nevada.  The complaint alleged that kitchen employees employed by Caesar's were subjected to ongoing and extreme sexual harassment, and were retaliated against for complaints about the hostile work environment produced by this harassment in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Some of the complainants intervened in June 2005, adding various State law claims.  The parties settled the case in August 2007 by entry of a consent decree.  There are several published opinions: U.S. E.E.O.C. v. Caesars Entertainment, Inc., 237 F.R.D. 428 (D.Nev. 2006) (denying Defendants' Renewed Motion for Protective Order); U.S. E.E.O.C. v. Caesars Entertainment, 2006 WL 1168840 (D.Nev. 2006) (granting Defendant Pinelo's Motion for Summary Judgment); and U.S. E.E.O.C. v. Caesars Entertainment, Inc., 2007 WL 1231776 (D.Nev. 2007) (granting Defendant Hernandez's Motion for Summary Judgment).

The consent decree included non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses, required the expungement of complainants' employment records, and required Caesar's to provide neutral references for complainants.  Caesar's was required to work with an Equal Employment Opportunity Consultant to develop its non-discrimination and non-retaliation policy, to create a training program that would educate employees about discrimination, harassment, and retaliation, and to help develop and monitor the complaint and investigation process.  The decree, in effect for three years, also required regular reporting to the EEOC on complaints and on the non-discrimination and non-retaliation policy, which was to be distributed to employees and posted.  In case of non-compliance, Caesar's would have thirty days to remedy the problem, after which the EEOC would be entitled to ask the court to enforce the decree.  Additionally, $850,000.00 is to be paid by Caesar's to individual complainants and to similarly situated employees identified by the EEOC. The settlement term was three years.  The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2010.

This case, ""U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Caesars Palace,"" involves a lawsuit filed by four plaintiffs, Elina Masid, Jessica Alvarado Panameno, Tange Johnson, and Candelaria Turcios, against their employer, Caesars Entertainment, Inc., and its parent company, Park Place Entertainment Corporation. The plaintiffs, who are current or former employees of Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Nevada, allege that they were subjected to a hostile work environment by their supervisors, Juan Gonzalez, Daniel Pinelo, and Ricardo Hernandez, who made unwanted sexual advances, requests for sexual favors, and other inappropriate comments and conduct towards the plaintiffs. Despite the plaintiffs' rejection of these advances and their complaints to the company, the supervisors continued their behavior, which was facilitated by the company's failure to properly address and prevent sexual harassment in the workplace. The plaintiffs seek monetary relief for emotional distress and other damages, as well as a permanent injunction to stop the harassment and retaliation. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and private law firms. The case was filed in the District Court of Nevada and is currently ongoing. The court has granted various motions to substitute attorneys, with Federico C.

PC-FL-0010,"In the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida, a group of state prisoners filed a class action complaint pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on September 12, 2003.  The plaintiffs' attorneys included lawyers of the Florida Institutional Legal Services, Inc., the Florida Justice Institute, Inc., the Southern Poverty Law Center, and private counsel.  The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as attorneys' fees, from the defendant state officials, basing their complaint upon allegations that Florida Department of Corrections (FDOC) officers improperly used chemical agents (tear gas and pepper spray) against prisoners in ""non-spontaneous"" circumstances.  (Spontaneous circumstances, the plaintiffs explained, were those presenting an immediate need to use force without time for reflection or planning.)  

According to the complaint, rather than use the chemical agents as a good-faith means of maintaining prison order and discipline, the officers used these chemicals maliciously and sadistically, contravening the Eighth Amendment's prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment,.  The complaint detailed numerous instances of chemical agent misuse, in violation of applicable FDOC regulations governing use of force,.  The complaint also set out allegations of officials' use of stronger-than-authorized chemical agents,  officials' increasingly-common resort to use of chemical agents when unauthorized by regulations, their failure to fairly investigate and act upon prisoners' grievances stemming from the misuse and overuse of these sprays, and purposeful neglect of post-use procedures to limit pain and injury stemming from these chemicals. Plaintiffs sought an injunction that would forbidthe excessive and unjustified use of these chemical agents and require that the defendants develop and submit to the court a comprehensive plan ensuring only the constitutionally-justified use of this form of discipline.

On July 14, 2004, in an unpublished order, District Judge John E. Steel denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the case, finding that the plaintiffs had standing and had sufficiently alleged facts which, if proven true, would entitle them to relief.  Judge Steel later, on September 20, 2004, denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction and expressed reluctance to interfere in prison operations, at least at this stage of the proceedings.

The effort to have plaintiffs' case certified as a class action was rejected by Judge Steel on June 21, 2005.  According to the court, the fact-intensive nature of the use of these sprays by correctional officers precluded his finding that the factual allegations by the named plaintiffs had sufficient typicality and commonality with other and future prisoners' circumstances.  Plaintiffs' attempt to have Judge Steel reconsider his denial of class action status was denied on July 21, 2005.

On November 28, 2005, the case was dismissed without prejudice, after the parties had, on November 23, 2005, filed a stipulation of dismissal, with each party to bear its own costs and expenses.  Although this suggests that a settlement occurred, we have neither a copy of a settlement agreement nor any information about settlement terms.

This document is a legal complaint filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against K-Mart Corporation for violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. The EEOC alleges that K-Mart subjected Debbie Denton and other female employees to sexual harassment and a hostile work environment, resulting in constructive discharge and retaliation against Denton and others for opposing these unlawful actions. The document also states that all necessary prerequisites for filing this lawsuit have been met.

The plaintiffs, Debbie Denton and a class of female employees, are represented by the EEOC and are seeking relief for the discrimination and harassment they have faced at K-Mart's Phoenix and Winslow, Arizona facilities. The defendant, K-Mart Corporation, is accused of violating Title VII by engaging in unlawful employment practices, specifically sexual harassment and retaliation against employees who spoke out against these actions.

The specific allegations made by the EEOC include subjecting Debbie Denton and other female employees to a sexually hostile work environment, constructive discharge, and retaliation for opposing these practices. The EEOC also claims that K-Mart's actions were intentional and done with malice or reckless indifference to the federally protected rights of the plaintiffs.

The plaintiff is represented by both public and private counsel. The plaintiff asked the court for a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and damages. The plaintiff asked the court to permanently enjoin the defendants from: imposing the sex-offender label on him without a hearing that met due process requirements; subjecting the plaintiff to conditions that were different than similar supervisees; and failing to accommodate his religious exercise. The plaintiff also alleged that he has not had the same opportunities as other supervisees to acquire a job, obtain a driver's license, or receive education. 

On June 25 2007, Judge Lee Yeakel dismissed the plaintiff's claim under the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act of 2000. The plaintiff's claims under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 were allowed to proceed. The decision allowing the claims to proceed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 was appealed. On June 23, 2008, the US Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, affirmed the decision of the district court.

On March 24, 2009, Judge Lee Yeakel ordered that the defendants must afford the plaintiff due process of law, and dismissed, without prejudice, all of his other claims. This judgment was appealed. 

On May 20, 2010, The United States Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit, ruled mostly for the plaintiff, slightly modifying the amount of due process that the plaintiff must be afforded. 

On March 30, 2011, the district court (Judge Lee Yeakel) granted the plaintiff's motion for the enforcement of the March 24, 2009 judgment as confirmed by the court of appeals, and ordered that the determination of whether the plaintiff should be considered a sex offender should conform with the plaintiff's due process rights.  On August 24, 2011, the district court (Judge Lee Yeakel) denied the plaintiff's second motion for enforcement of the judgment, ruling that the defendant's actions after the March 30, 2011 order had sufficiently complied with the March 24, 2009 judgment.

The plaintiff's original sentence for murder ended in 2012. He will remain under mandatory supervision for possessing a weapon in prison in 1989 until 2016.

On September 20, 2013, the court granted a stipulation of dismissal for the Texas Department of Pardons and Parole, and dismissed the claim with prejudice. It appears that the plaintiff settled with the Texas Department of Pardons and Parole.

On December 12, 2013, the Texas Department of Criminal Justice filed a motion to dismiss the complaint as moot since they did not have the ability to grant the relief that the plaintiff was asking for. The Texas Department of Criminal Justice stated that only the Texas Board of Pardons and Parole had this power, and they had been dismissed from the complaint.

On March 13, 2014, the plaintiff filed a fifth amended complaint based on the defendant's motion to dismiss for mootness. On July 29, 2014, the plaintiff filed a sixth amended complaint alleging that the plaintiff was unable to move into suitable housing and denied employment due to the defendant's actions. Not much activity appears on the docket thereafter. On Jan. 20, 2015, the parties filed a stipulation to dismiss the case. The court issued its final judgment the next day, granting the motion.

The document titled ""Meza v. Livingston (2010)"" is a comprehensive summary of the legal case between the plaintiff, Raul Meza, and the defendants, Brad Livingston and Stuart Jenkins. Meza, a parolee, filed a lawsuit against Livingston, the Director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, and Jenkins, a parole board official, challenging the conditions of his mandatory supervision. Specifically, Meza argued that the requirement to register as a sex offender and participate in sex offender therapy violated his constitutional rights. The court recognized the significant liberty interest of Meza in avoiding these conditions and found that the procedures used by the state did not provide adequate due process. The court determined that Meza was entitled to certain procedural safeguards, including written notice, disclosure of evidence, a hearing, and the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses. The court also addressed the issue of qualified immunity for the defendants, ultimately determining that they were not entitled to it. The case was remanded for further proceedings, with a dissenting opinion arguing for the need for non-attorney assistance for non-sex offender parolees.

The plaintiffs sought emergency risk-mitigation procedures and release measures to reduce the population at the PCCF.  On May 18, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss and the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. The plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal on October 8, 2020. <hr>

On April 17, 2020, federal detainees at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (PCCF) filed this putative class action complaint at the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts, addressing safety concerns posed by COVID-19. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit as a habeas petition under 28 U.S.C. § 2241 and as an injunctive and declaratory action under 28 U.S.C. § 2201. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that conditions of confinement lacked reasonable preventative measures in response to the heightened health risks from COVID-19, in violation of their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. They pointed to ongoing failures by the defendant to comply with basic safety measures under the interim guidelines provided for correctional facilities by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, including its social distancing requirement. The plaintiffs sought a Temporary Restraining Order (TRO), declaratory and injunctive relief, and a writ of habeas corpus ordering immediate action to reduce the population at the PCCF and institute proper hygienic measures, with an independent monitor to ensure compliance. Concurrently, the plaintiffs filed a motion requesting that all federal detainees held or to be held by the PCCF be granted class certification. The case was assigned to Judge Leo T. Sorokin. 

On April 20, the defendants filed an emergency motion to stay the consideration of the proposed class certification, or a two-week extension to file a response to the motion for class certification in the alternative. The court granted the motion on the same day. 

The next day, the defendant filed a motion to dismiss for lack of subject matter jurisdiction and failure to state a claim, as there were no cases of COVID-19 in PCCF in the detainee population as of April 20, and the petitioners did not have underlying medical conditions. A second motion was filed on April 24, further submitting that the requested remedies by the plaintiffs involved a challenge to the fact or duration of their confinement, outside of the writ of habeas. 

The defendant submitted a status report confirming three cases of COVID-19 among employees on April 29. A hearing was held the next day.

On May 1, the court ordered the defendant to answer a list of questions addressing disputed factual questions and unclear matters by May 6. Questions include housing arrangements of the proposed class, policies governing face masks, testing capacity in the PCCF, as well as the respondents’ response to the three confirmed cases of COVID-19. The defendants submitted a status report confirming two additional cases of COVID-19 among employees on May 5, and report of one additional case on May 12. 

On May 18, the court denied the defendant's motion to dismiss, finding that the plaintiffs' claims fell within the scope of a habeas petition and that the plaintiffs’ failure to satisfy the PLRA’s exhaustion requirement is not grounds for dismissal. The court also denied the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction because they failed to meet their burden of establishing that they were likely to succeed in showing that the defendant had been deliberately indifferent to the risk of COVID-19. The court further ordered that the parties file a joint status report regarding how the matter should proceed, and ordered the defendant to file a status report explaining whether and how PCCF is expanding its testing in line with the institution-wide testing occurring in DOC facilities and its reasoning by May 27. 

On May 27, the defendants reported that they did not plan to institute institution-wide testing occurring in DOC facilities because it was the medical opinion of PCCF’s medical director that such measures were not warranted at PCCF in the present circumstances. 

According to the latest status report on June 2, one employee at PCCF tested positive. 28 detainees were tested with two results coming back positive. 

According to the June 24 status report, 53 individuals at PCCF were tested, with two positive results from pretrial detainees and one from a former detainee who tested positive following his release. 

The plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal on October 8, 2020.","

This memorandum of law pertains to the case of Baez, et al. v. Moniz, where four federal pretrial detainees at the Plymouth County Correctional Facility (PCCF) in Massachusetts have filed a motion for emergency injunctive relief against Antone Moniz, the facility's superintendent. The detainees, represented by four individuals, allege that Moniz has acted with deliberate indifference to the substantial risk of COVID-19 in the facility, violating their Fifth and Eighth Amendment rights. The petitioners argue that Moniz has not implemented adequate measures to prevent the spread of the virus, such as social distancing and proper cleaning protocols, putting them at a heightened risk for serious illness or death. They are seeking immediate release and the appointment of an expert to determine who else should be released. Moniz, along with the Plymouth County Sheriff's Office, has opposed the motion, arguing that the court lacks jurisdiction, the detainees lack standing, and they have failed to exhaust administrative remedies. The court has denied the detainees' motion, citing the low number of COVID-19 cases in Plymouth County and the measures taken by the Department of Corrections to prevent the spread of the virus in the facility.

IM-NY-0024,"On December 13, 2005, a group of battered immigrant wives and children of lawful U.S. residents filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, challenging the denial of food stamps, Medicaid, and other public assistance benefits to certain categories of immigrants. The plaintiffs alleged that they applied for public benefits at New York City Job Centers, but were improperly denied those benefits in violation of state and federal law. They sought emergency injunctive relief and class certification. 

The defendants denied the allegations and sought to disqualify plaintiffs' counsel from handling the case. The defendants argued that the plaintiffs' attorneys had submitted affidavits in support of a preliminary injunction and were therefore witnesses. The district court (Judge Jed Rakoff) denied the request to disqualify. 414 F. Supp. 2d 469.

On February 16, 2006, the district court entered a partial preliminary injunction that required certain immediate corrections to New York City and State public assistance agency systems relative to applications for public benefits by noncitizens. It then conducted a nine-day evidentiary hearing to further assess the case and determine whether additional preliminary injunctive relief and/or class certification were warranted. 

On August 29, 2006, Judge Rakoff certified the class and expanded the preliminary injunction. Judge Rakoff found that there were a substantial likelihood plaintiffs would prevail given evidence of numerous instances of wrongful denials with respect to battered aliens who were eligible for benefits, due to inadequately trained state and City personnel and faulty training materials and policy directives. 445 F.Supp.2d 400. The defendants' motion for reconsideration was denied. M.K.B. v. Eggleston, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81704. Shortly thereafter, the parties reached a tentative settlement.

Following a fairness hearing on May 24, 2007, the court approved the settlement agreement by order dated June 26, 2007. Under the agreement, many class members would receive ""automatic"" case reviews to determine whether they were entitled to retroactive public benefits. The City agreed to train 150 immigrant liaisons to review and handle the case reviews of class members and process future applications by immigrants for public benefits. The City also agreed to refrain from denying, discontinuing, or reducing public benefits based on immigration status to eligible class members. The informal relief system created by the court's preliminary injunction would be continued and quality assurance audits would be conducted every six months. The court retained jurisdiction for four years to monitor compliance with the terms of the agreement. 

On July 16, 2007, the court entered judgment on a settlement agreement regarding attorney's fees in which the defendants agreed to pay the plaintiffs' attorneys $2.85 million.

On September 29, 2011, the court ordered an extension of the settlement agreement through February 15, 2013. Minor adjustments were made to account for problems with statutes of limitations. The defendants appealed the court's order to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals. The appeal was withdrawn, however, on April 9, 2012. 

On July 3, 2013, the court again extended the term of the settlement, as well as the monitoring of compliance, for two additional cycles to August 15, 2014. On August 8, 2014, the court issued a final stipulation and order under which the City of New York and the State of New York agreed to pay $217,500 and $147,500, respectively, to plaintiff’s attorneys within 90 days.

The settlement expired on August 15, 2014. There have been no further updates to this case, and there is no reason to believe it is ongoing.","

""Stipulation and Order in Class Action Lawsuit Against City of New York and State of New York"" is a comprehensive settlement agreement between the plaintiffs, represented by various legal aid organizations and advocacy groups, and the defendants, including the New York City Human Resources Administration (HRA), the New York State Office of Temporary and Disability Assistance (OTDA), and the New York State Department of Health (DOH). The lawsuit, heard by Judge Jed S. Rakoff in the US Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, centered around the defendants' policies and practices of denying public benefits to battered immigrant wives and their children. The plaintiffs, identified by their initials, alleged that the defendants had failed to properly train HRA employees on the eligibility requirements for battered qualified aliens, resulting in the wrongful denial of benefits for eligible individuals. Seeking both preliminary injunctive relief and class certification, the plaintiffs were ultimately successful in both motions, with the court finding that the defendants' policies and inadequate training had indeed led to the denial of benefits. The defendants, represented by the New York City Law Department and the Office of the Attorney General, opposed the plaintiffs' claims, but a settlement agreement was ultimately reached.

IM-MA-0009,"This federal lawsuit, filed by the cities of Chelsea and Lawrence, Massachusetts, on Feb. 8, 2017, challenged President Trump’s Jan. 25, 2017 <a href=""https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-01-30/pdf/2017-02102.pdf"">Executive Order 13768</a>, dealing with immigration enforcement, which threatened to withhold federal funds from ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" and take enforcement action against any locality that impedes the federal government's immigration law. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel and the Boston Lawyers’ Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts.

The plaintiffs alleged that the Executive Order violated the Tenth Amendment by coercing cities to choose between losing federal funding and losing control of their municipal self-governance. The Executive Order does not include a clear definition of what it means to be a ""sanctuary"" jurisdiction, apart from referencing 8 U.S.C. § 1373, which provides that a local government entity cannot prohibit or restrict communication between government entities or officials and federal immigration authorities. The plaintiffs alleged their own compliance with § 1373, but complained first that § 1373 is unconstitutional, and second, that Executive Order threatened their funding without advance notice by unclearly extending beyond § 1373. The plaintiffs alleged that the U.S. had begun to designate certain cities as ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" and that Chelsea and Lawrence stood to be designated as such. In order to improve cooperation between immigrant residents and municipal police, Chelsea designated itself a ""sanctuary city"" and Lawrence took similar actions. The plaintiffs explained that they therefore feared being labeled ""sanctuary jurisdictions"" under the Executive Order and thus losing federal grants. As small cities with large working-class immigrant populations, the plaintiffs feared the implications of such a loss of key funding for their municipal budgets, including for public services that have nothing to do with immigration.

The complaint sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the plaintiffs asked for a declaration that Chelsea and Lawrence comply with 8 U.S.C. § 1373, that § 1373 is an unconstitutional infringement on municipal and state self-government authority, and that the Executive Order violates the Tenth Amendment, and the Fifth Amendment's due process clause. In addition, they claimed that the Executive Order violates the separation of powers by penalizing § 1373 violations without Congressional approval.

The case was assigned to Judge George A. O'Toole Jr. 

On Apr. 10, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The defendants argued that they have taken no action against the cities pursuant to the executive order and that the cities cannot show they have been injured by the existence of the EO. 

Meanwhile, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California on April 25, 2017, granted a nationwide preliminary injunction against operation of the Executive Order.  See <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15608"">San Francisco v. Trump</a> for details. 

On May 2, the plaintiffs moved to stay the proceedings in light of the nationwide preliminary injunction, and the court entered a stay on May 4. The case is marked ""administratively closed,"" which just means that it is on hold. The parties can inform the Court if they wish to resume litigation.

The document, titled ""City of Chelsea and City of Lawrence v. Donald J. Trump et al,"" is a compilation of summaries from various court cases referenced in a larger legal document submitted to the United States District Court in case number 17-cv-10214-GAO. The case involves a dispute between the cities of Chelsea and Lawrence, Massachusetts, as plaintiffs, and President Donald J. Trump, the United States government, and certain cabinet officials, as defendants. The plaintiffs have brought forth a lawsuit challenging the constitutionality of three federal executive orders related to border security and immigration enforcement. The main allegations made by the plaintiffs are that these executive orders violate the principles of federalism, the separation of powers, and the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as well as the Tenth Amendment. The plaintiffs seek declaratory and injunctive relief from the court. The attorneys involved in the case include the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General, Benjamin C. Mizer, representing the defendants, and a team of attorneys representing the plaintiffs, including Alexandra Lu Goodwin Procter LLP, Oren M. Sellstrom of Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights and Economic Justice, and Michelle Sohn of Goodwin Procter LLP.

DR-UT-0001,"On May 8, 2006, twelve deaf Utah State University students filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Utah, on behalf of themselves and all others similarly situated, against Utah State and its  Board of Regents. The case was brought under Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, with the Plaintiffs alleging that the Defendants had discriminated against them in many ways, including: denying them access to the full benefit of the University's programs, services, and activities; failing to provide for effective communication through the use of auxiliary aids and services; failing or refusing to provide timely accommodations; utilizing discriminatory policies, practices and procedures that tend to screen out students who are deaf; and failing to meet the ADA's mandate to provide services in the most integrated setting.  The students were represented by private counsel.

Factual allegations included: that the University failed to provide accommodations for the use of American Sign Language, by providing unqualified or under-qualified interpreters -- the University allegedly justified this by claiming that it could not find qualified interpreters, but declined to hire such qualified interpreters when students presented them the opportunity; that the University's program for providing notes to deaf students was inadequate to the point that notes were often provided to students only long after the tests or exams for which they were relevant had already occurred; that students were sometimes required to attend classes where no interpreters were provided; that in some such classes the University's proposed solution was to have students make audio recordings of classes and them have them transcribed later, forcing students to sit through classes they could not understand or participate in, and then review transcripts during their free time. There were further examples of similar alleged violations. 

The plaintiffs sought a declaratory judgment an injunction requiring Utah State to adopt written policies and training programs to correct the alleged violations and to require them to provide appropriate auxiliary aids, services, and accommodations. The plaintiffs also sought attorneys' fees and damages for financial loss and emotional distress.

On April 17, 2007, the parties entered a Stipulation and Joint Motion for Voluntary Dismissal with Prejudice, requesting the court dismiss the case, which it did the following day. The parties had reached a settlement, the terms of which were not included in the Court record.  According to news reports, the school promised to employ one full-time staff interpreter for every two deaf students who needed those services, with the interpreters to be available to students to interpret during classes, on-campus meetings and on-campus extracurricular activities.  Transcript service and note-taking services would continue, and if students felt they were behind they could receive tutoring.  ","

This document is a legal case filed by a group of individuals against Utah State University and the Utah State Board of Regents for discrimination against Deaf students. The plaintiffs, including Jon Helgesen, John Galli, Christina Hamilton, Ellen O'Hara, Brent Patterson, Callista Powell, Jonathan Roberts, James B. Smith, and Emmalee Sparrow, are represented by attorneys Dale H. Boam, Richard F. Armknecht III, and Tracy Scott Cowdell. The defendants, on the other hand, are represented by attorney Joni J. Jones from the Utah Attorney General's Office. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants have violated their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by denying them equal access to educational opportunities and failing to provide necessary accommodations, such as qualified interpreters and note takers. Additionally, they claim that the defendants have implemented discriminatory policies and practices that have resulted in emotional and physical harm, as well as limitations to their educational opportunities.

PC-MI-0003,"NOTE: There are two separate cases, in two separate districts, under the caption Hadix.  This summary and documents are for the Eastern District of Michigan case, 2:80-cv-73581-JF, filed in 1980.  As explained below, in 1992, the Eastern District judge, John Feikens, split that case in two, and sent part of it (the part relating to medical and mental health care, and eventually fire safety) to the Western District, where it received the docket number 4:92-CV-110.  The Western District case is included in the Clearinghouse as PC-MI-19.  

On September 18, 1980, prisoners at the State Prison of Southern Michigan filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Michigan Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan.  The plaintiffs asked the court for declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief, alleging that their rights had been violated by unconstitutional conditions at the prison.  The plaintiffs complained that the prison was overcrowded, infested with cockroaches, plagued by flying and nesting birds, full of bird droppings and feces, non-ventilated, smelly, and unsanitary.  The prisoners also complained of deficiencies in the areas of plumbing, security, grievance procedures, work opportunities for prisoners, physical protection of prisoners, recreation, mental health, classification procedures, lighting, insulation, health care, noise level, staff training, food availability and preservation procedures, mail handling, visitation, fire safety, rehabilitation programs, parole procedures, educational opportunities, library services, clothing allowance, and dental care.

On February 13, 1985, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Judge John Feikens) entered a consent decree in the case, settling the issues of sanitation, safety, health care, fire safety, overcrowding, security, food service, management and operations, and mail.  The decree stated that the remaining issues (access to courts, classification procedures, grievance procedures, and visitation) were to be resolved by the court after a hearing on the merits.  

In June 1986, a member of the plaintiff class asked the district court to hold the defendants in contempt of the decree for depriving him of property without a hearing.  On July 1, 1986, the court (Judge Feikens) ordered the defendants to return the prisoner's property and to hold an administrative hearing before taking any of his property away from him.  The defendants appealed.  On March 17, 1988, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit (Judges Albert Joseph Engel, Robert B. Krupansky, and David A. Nelson) issued a per curiam opinion reversing the district court's decision and remanding the case for further consideration.  Hadix v. Johnson, No. 86-1701, 1988 WL 24204 (6th Cir. March 17, 1988).

On July 1, 1988, following a bench trial, the district court (Judge Feikens) held that the inmates had been unconstitutionally denied access to courts, ordering the prison to modify its library, legal services, and administrative grievance programs.  The court further held that plaintiffs' right of access to the courts necessitated the presence of Prison Legal Services (PLS) inside the walls of the prison.  Hadix v. Johnson, 694 F.Supp. 259 (E.D.Mich. 1988).  

Following this order, the plaintiffs asked the district court for a temporary injunction to prevent the defendants from searching the PLS offices inside the prison.  On November 10, 1987, the district court (Judge Feikens) issued the temporary order, enjoining the defendants from searching the PLS offices without PLS civilian personnel being present unless they gave two hours' notice of the search.  The defendants appealed.  On March 30, 1989, the Sixth Circuit (Judges Nelson, George Clifton Edwards, and Danny Julian Boggs) issued a per curiam opinion affirming the district court's order.  Hadix v. Johnson, No. 88-1144, 1989 WL 27984 (6th Cir. March 30, 1989).

Shortly thereafter, the plaintiff class asked the district court to clarify a section of the consent decree dealing with the handling of a prisoner's legal materials.  On April 21, 1989, the district court (Judge Feikens) held that the consent decree was not violated by the prison's rule limiting the amount of legal materials that a prisoner could posses to that which could be contained in one footlocker.  The court also held that the prison was required to hold administrative hearings on excess legal materials within thirty days of seizure.  Hadix v. Johnson, 712 F.Supp. 550 (E.D.Mich. 1989).

The plaintiffs asked the district court to award them attorneys' fees.  On June 22, 1990, the court (Judge Feikens) ordered the defendants to pay the full amount of the plaintiffs' attorney fees, less telephone costs.  Hadix v. Johnson, 740 F.Supp. 433 (E.D.Mich. 1990).  The defendants appealed.  On August 29, 1991, the Sixth Circuit (Judges Boyce F. Martin, Jr., Nelson, and Harry Walker Wellford) issued a per curiam opinion vacating the district court's fee award and remanding the case for further consideration on the issue of whether the plaintiffs were the prevailing party in the lawsuit.  Hadix v. Johnson, No. 90-1810, 1991 WL 165653 (6th Cir. Aug. 29, 1991).  On remand, the district court made further findings of fact and again held that the plaintiffs were the prevailing party.  The defendants appealed.  On January 23, 1995, the Sixth Circuit (Judges Nelson, Alan Eugene Norris, and Martha Craig Daughtrey) issued a per curiam opinion affirming the district court's decision.  Hadix v. Johnson, No. 94-1158, 1995 WL 25416 (6th Cir. Jan. 23, 1995).

On April 21, 1992, the defendants asked the district court to relinquish control and supervision of the mental health provisions of the consent decree; the plaintiffs asked the court to adopt the mental health orders entered in USA v. Michigan (No. 1:84-CV-63) (PC-MI-0007) by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan (Judge Richard A. Enslen).  On May 15, 1992, the district court (Judge Feikens) denied both requests.  On further consideration, however, on June 5, 1992, the district court relinquished control and supervision of the provisions governing mental health care and medical care, transferring them to the Western District, Judge Enslen, for further proceedings as he deemed appropriate.  Hadix v. Johnson, 792 F.Supp. 527 (E.D.Mich. 1992). 

Sometime in 1994, a class of inmates at five different correctional institutions in Michigan asked both district courts for injunctive relief against the defendants, alleging that the defendants had violated their constitutional right of access to the courts.  The matter was dealt with in the Western District case.  

On March 31, 1994, the defendants asked the Eastern District Court to modify the consent decree's requirements for out-of-cell activities.  On March 14, 1995, the district court (Judge Feikens) held that none of the defendants asserted reasons warranted modification of the decree and denied the request.  Hadix v. Johnson, 879 F.Supp. 743 (E.D.Mich. 1995).  The defendants appealed.  On September 20, 1995, the Sixth Circuit (Judges Nelson, Norris, and Daughtrey) issued a per curiam opinion vacating the district court's order and remanding the case so that the district court could clarify the reasons for its denial of the defendants' request.  Hadix v. Johnson, Nos. 93-1551, 93-1555, 93-1559, 93-1642, 93-1643, 1995 WL 559372 (6th Cir.(Mich.) Sept. 20, 1995.

On June 10, 1996, the defendants asked both the district court and the Sixth Circuit to terminate the consent decree pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA).  On July 2, 1996, the Sixth Circuit issued an unsigned opinion denying the motion for immediate termination and remanding the issue back to the district court.  Hadix v. Johnson, Nos. 94-2008, 96-1422, 1996 WL 370152 (6th Cir. July 2, 1996).  on July 5, 1996, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan (Judge Feikens) denied the request for immediate termination of the consent decree.  Hadix v. Johnson, 933 F.Supp. 1360 (E.D.Mich. 1996).  

On September 10, 1996, the United States Department of Justice asked the Eastern District Court for leave to intervene in the case for purposes of defending the constitutionality of the PLRA, and on September 16, 1996, the district court (Judge Feikens) granted the motion to intervene.  The defendants renewed their motion to terminate relief under the automatic stay provision of the PLRA.  On November 1, 1996, the district court (Judge Feikens) denied the motion to terminate, holding that the sections of the PLRA in question were an unconstitutional violation of the principle of separation of powers.  Hadix v. Johnson, 947 F.Supp. 1100 (E.D.Mich. 1996).  The defendants appealed.  On May 20, 1998, the Sixth Circuit (Judge Karen Nelson Moore) held that the automatic stay provision was constitutional and remanded the case back to the district court.  Hadix v. Johnson, 144 F.3d 925 (6th Cir. 1998).  The plaintiffs sought Supreme Court review, but the U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.  Hadix v. McGinnis, 524 U.S. 952 (1998).  

The plaintiffs asked both district courts to grant them attorneys fees for their counsels' unpaid work up to this point in the litigation, and the defendants argued that the PLRA's cap on attorneys fees should apply to any fee award that the judge made.  On December 4, 1996, the Eastern District Court (Judge Feikens) awarded the requested fees, holding that the PLRA's cap on attorneys fees applied only to work performed after the Act's effective date.  Hadix v. Johnson, 947 F.Supp. 1113 (E.D.Mich. 1996).  (Likewise, on May 23, 1997, the Western District Court (Judge Enslen) awarded the requested fees.) Hadix v. Johnson, 965 F.Supp. 996 (W.D.Mich. 1997).  The defendants appealed both decisions.  On April 17, 1998, the Sixth Circuit (Justice Cornelia Groefsema Kennedy) held that the fee cap imposed by the PLRA did not apply to fee petitions, regardless of whether the work was performed before of after the PLRA's enactment date.  The court then partially upheld and partially reversed the fee award, remanding the appeals back to the district courts for further consideration.  Hadix v. Johnson, 143 F.3d 246 (6th Cir. 1998).  The defendants sought and obtained Supreme Court review.  On June 21, 1999, the U.S. Supreme Court (Justice Sandra Day O'Connor) held that the PLRA limits attorney fees for postjudgment monitoring services performed after the PLRA's effective date, but does not limit fees for monitoring performed before that date.  Martin v. Hadix, 527 U.S. 343 (1999).

On March 18, 1999, the district court (Judge Feikens) transferred several additional components of the original Consent Decree (regarding water temperatures, housing temperatures and ventilation in the Southern Michigan Correctional Facility, and some issues relating to housing in the Egeler Correctional Facility) to the Western District.  The Eastern District explained that the rationale for transfer was that health care was implicated in these provisions.  The court then terminated the part of the consent decree requiring supervision of facilities, and informed the defendants that he would terminate the consent decree entirely if they could demonstrate substantial compliance.  Hadix v. Johnson, 45 F.2d 584 (E.D.Mich. 1999).  Both parties appealed.  On October 5, 2000, the Sixth Circuit (Judge Moore) reversed, holding that the district court had not made the necessary findings, and remanded the case back to the district court, ordering that the prisoners must be given an opportunity to submit additional evidence of ongoing violations.  Hadix v. Johnson, 228 F.3d 662 (6th Cir. 2000).

On November 15, 2000, the Eastern District transferred to the Western District some additional fire safety issues.   On June 27, 2001, the Eastern District issued its Order of Termination, terminating its jurisdiction over all sections of the Consent Decree remaining in the Eastern District.) 

An inmate named Pepper Moore asked the district court to award him money for his costs as well as an incentive award for his role as a class representative.  The district court denied those requests, and he appealed.  On March 10, 2003, the Sixth Circuit (Judge Moore) affirmed the district court's decision.  Hadix v. Johnson, 322 F.3d 895 (6th Cir. 2003). On October 6, 2003, the Supreme Court of the United States denied certiorari, thus closing the case. Moore v. Johnson, 540 U.S. 941 (2003).

The document at hand, titled ""Hadix v. Johnson: A Comprehensive Summary of a Long-Standing Civil Rights Case,"" is an in-depth overview of a class action lawsuit brought by prisoners at the State Prison of Southern Michigan (SPSM) against state prison officials. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the Michigan Legal Services and the Prisoner Rights Law Center, alleged numerous violations of their constitutional rights while incarcerated, including lack of access to legal resources, unequal treatment, and denial of educational and vocational opportunities. The defendants, represented by the Michigan Attorney General's office, denied these claims and argued that the prison was operating within its constitutional rights. The case proceeded to a bench trial, where the plaintiffs were granted a temporary injunction preventing prison officials from searching the Prison Legal Services (PLS) offices without a civilian staff member present. The defendants appealed this decision, but the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals ultimately affirmed the injunction, stating that the defendants had not met their burden of proof. The district court also issued a consent decree, requiring the defendants to make various improvements to the prison facilities and programs. Throughout the court proceedings, which included multiple hearings and modifications, both parties presented evidence and arguments to support their respective positions. The attorneys involved in the case included the plaintiffs' counsel,",0.7991,0.086,0.1553,0.3578,0.0383,0.0693,0.4612,0.0496,0.0896
DR-PA-0006,"On June 27, 2002, Barrier Busters (a disability advocacy group) and a class of disabled individuals filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania against the City of Erie, PA. The Plaintiffs alleged that the city of Erie had frequently failed to install mandatory curb cuts and to otherwise comply with the accessibility mandates of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 et seq., when it performed road and sidewalk construction and alterations since the ADA was passed in 1992.

The parties entered a court-approved Partial Consent Decree on March 18, 2003. On September 16, 2003, the parties entered a Second Partial Consent Decree and Partial Settlement; a third consent decree was entered on April 1, 2004, and a fourth on February 2, 2005. The Clearinghouse has not obtained these consent decrees, but it is clear from later documents that Erie made substantial commitments to both ensure adherence to the ADA curb cut requirements for new roads and future resurfacing projects, and to retrofit with curb cuts all areas where roads were built or resurfaced after the January 26, 1992 effective date of the ADA.  Erie committed to make annual reports showing where new road work had taken place and where new curb cuts were built. The consent agreements also recognized that Erie was not responsible for the non-compliance of state roads and highways in Erie that were resurfaced by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation.

In 2006, a separate case was filed against PennDOT, addressing the issues of ADA compliance and curb cuts on state roads in Erie. See <i>Voices for Independence v. Pennsylvania Department of Transportation</i> in related cases. The plaintiffs in <i>Voices for Independence</i> were represented by the same attorneys as the plaintiffs in this case.

In 2010, the Plaintiffs observed that the City of Erie's street resurfacing in 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010 should have triggered the construction of ADA-compliant curb cuts, but none were built, contrary to the earlier agreements. On September 27, 2011, the court entered a stipulated order under which Erie agreed to retrofit these sites with curb cuts and to pay Plaintiffs $31,000 in attorneys' fees and costs for the period from March 11, 2011, to August 26, 2011. This stipulated order did not abrogate the earlier Consent Agreements.

Nevertheless, Erie failed to install curb cuts. In an attempt to correct the problem, the parties agreed to a second stipulated order on August 31, 2012. The city promised to take remedial action to install these curb cuts and agreed to pay an unspecified amount to the plaintiffs for attorneys' fees and costs.

On April 18, 2013, the Third Stipulated Order was entered, which changed Erie's reporting obligations to the plaintiffs to make the process more efficient. Erie agreed to pay an unspecified amount to the Plaintiffs for attorneys' fees and costs. The Third Stipulated Order was amended on May 22, 2014, to mandate that construction work performed on or before August 5 must include curb ramps within the same construction season. The City also committed to use “best efforts” to complete 70% of curb ramps within the same calendar year for construction performed after August 5; plaintiffs agreed that, when necessary, construction could be delayed until June 30 of the next calendar year. 

On March 11, 2015, plaintiffs moved to enforce the consent decrees. They alleged that the City violated the consent decrees for “an unspecified number of years” by installing fewer than six curb ramps at “T”-shaped intersections and fewer than eight curb ramps at “+”-shaped intersections. After discussions between the parties, Judge Baxter approved a fifth consent decree on May 27, 2015. The Fifth Consent Decree required the City to install 6 or 8 ramps, as appropriate, in all future construction. It also required the City to add ramps across the “leg” of the T in “T”-shaped intersections missing them at a rate of at least 75 ramps per year and included associated reporting requirements. 

Three years later, a new disagreement emerged about what kinds of intersections had to be retrofitted with curb ramps. Plaintiffs asserted that adding a thin layer of asphalt to a concrete intersection was an “alteration” under the ADA that required installation curb ramps. Erie disagreed. It argued that it is only required to add curb ramps when replacing old asphalt with new asphalt at asphalt intersections. On September 26, 2018, the court entered the Fourth Stipulated Order, which adopted plaintiffs’ view based on June, 2013 U.S. Department of Transportation guidelines. The Order required: <ul>
<li>Installation of curb ramps at previously altered asphalt intersections at a rate of at least 125 ramps per year, estimated to finish by the end of 2024. 
<li> Installation of at least 125 curb ramps at previously altered concrete intersections by the end of 2025. 
</ul>
However, the parties could not reach an agreement on whether there was a legal requirement to install curb ramps at concrete intersections altered prior to July, 2013. Erie preserved its right to litigate this issue in the Fourth Stipulated Order. 

As of March 29, 2021, the consent decrees and stipulated orders remain in effect. The defendants continue to file annual status reports. The most recent status report was filed on February 2, 2021 and the case is ongoing.

This document, entitled ""Stipulated Order Between Plaintiffs Barrier Busters, et al. and Defendant City of Erie, Pennsylvania,"" is a court-ordered agreement between the plaintiffs and the defendant in a long-standing case regarding the lack of accessible curb ramps in the City of Erie. The plaintiffs, represented by the Disability Rights Network of Pennsylvania and the Erie County Office of Vocational Rehabilitation, allege that the City of Erie has violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) by failing to install curb ramps during street resurfacing projects. The case was first filed in 2002 and has since gone through a series of negotiations and court proceedings, resulting in multiple consent decrees and stipulated orders. The plaintiffs and the defendant have come to an agreement on the construction of curb ramps triggered by street resurfacing, with the city agreeing to construct 98 additional ramps in 2011 and a minimum of 75 ramps per year starting in 2015. The court has also retained jurisdiction to enforce these orders and any previous consent decrees between the parties. The plaintiffs have been represented by attorneys Craig Markham, J. Mark Finnegan, and the United States Department of Justice, while the city has been represented by their own attorneys. The court has held several status conferences",0.7381,0.1728,0.28,0.3158,0.0737,0.1195,0.3714,0.087,0.1409
PR-DC-0003,"On July 31, 2017, plaintiff, the Democracy Project, Inc., filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief against defendants Department of State, Department of Defense, and the Department of Justice under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA), 5 U.S.C. § 552. The plaintiff is a nonpartisan nonprofit organization whose focus is on informing the public of operations and activities of the government by gathering and disseminating information likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of executive branch operations and activities.

On April 6, 2017, President Trump ordered Tomahawk cruise missile strikes against a Syrian-government airbase without obtaining prior authorization from Congress (a Syrian-based policy promised by former President Barack Obama) and without articulating the legal justification for the strikes. The plaintiff submitted FOIA requests to the defendants the following day for all records “reflecting, discussing, or otherwise relating” to the strike “and/or the President’s legal authority to launch such a strike”. The plaintiff asked for these requests to be processed on an expedited basis. About one month later, having received none of the requested documents and having two of its expedited processing requests denied, the plaintiff brought this suit and filed a motion for preliminary injunction to have the documents produced by a date certain.

On July 13, 2017, U.S. District Judge Christopher R. Cooper granted in part and denied in part the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction, directing the defendants to process the FOIA requests on an expedited basis, but not by a certain date, and to limit the request to documents specifically related to the legal justifications for the April 6, 2017 Syria Strikes. 263 F.Supp.3d 293.

On September 8, 2017, the defendants made a production pursuant to the FOIA requests, but the plaintiff contested that the production was too heavily redacted and insufficient. On November 17, 2017, the defendants filed a motion for summary judgment, with the plaintiff filing a cross-motion for summary judgment on December 8, 2017, on the question of whether the defendants’ withholding of some documents was justified under various FOIA exemptions. On April 25, 2018, Judge Cooper, in reviewing the parties’ cross-motions, determined that he needed to also review the documents before it could resolve the dispute, and he ordered that the defendants produce documents that it had claimed were exempted under FOIA for an in-camera review by the court. On May 4, 2018, the defendants complied with the order and delivered the documents to the court. 

On August 21, 2018, Judge Cooper granted in part and denied in part each party’s motion for summary judgment. 320 F.Supp.3d 162. He found that, for the most part, the defendants’ withholdings were justified; however, he also found that some information in the documents had already been officially acknowledged, so that the defendants could not withhold that information. As of March 23, 2019, there has been no further filings or movement in the case, and the case appears to be closed.","

Protect Democracy Project, Inc. v. U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Justice, and U.S. Department of State is a lawsuit brought under the Freedom of Information Act by the plaintiff, Protect Democracy Project, Inc., against the defendants, three government departments. The plaintiff, a non-profit organization, requested documents related to President Trump's military strikes in Syria and alleged that the defendants failed to comply with FOIA by not providing the requested information. The defendants withheld fifteen documents, citing various FOIA exemptions, but the court found that some information had been officially acknowledged and could not be withheld. The plaintiff argued that the information was of public interest and urgency, and sought a court order to compel the defendants to produce the requested records. After a hearing, the court granted the plaintiff's request for a preliminary injunction to expedite document processing, and ordered the defendants to release certain documents for in camera review. The court ultimately granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion for summary judgment and the plaintiff's cross-motion, and also admitted attorney Steven A. as counsel for the plaintiff.

CJ-AL-0001,"On November 1, 2006, Aaron Lee Jones filed a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Alabama seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent the state of Alabama from using its lethal injection procedure against him.  The complaint alleged that the procedure was not medically approved and would result in extreme pain in violation of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments of the Constitution. The plaintiff was represented by private attorneys.  

On April 17, 2007, the district court (Judge Myron H. Thompson) denied the plaintiff's motion to stay his execution pending his challenge of the lethal injection procedure. His execution was scheduled for May 3, 2007. On April 27, 2007, the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit (Judge Joel Fredrick Dubina) affirmed. Both courts found that Jones delayed in bringing these constitutional claims.

Aaron Lee Jones was executed on May 3, 2007 by lethal injection. The case is now closed.
","

This collection of documents pertains to a legal case involving death row inmate Aaron Lee Jones and his challenge to Alabama's method of execution by lethal injection. Jones, represented by his attorneys, filed a complaint in federal court against the Commissioner of the Alabama Department of Corrections and the Warden of the Holman Correctional Facility, along with other unknown employees involved in the execution process. Jones claimed that the current procedures and personnel used by the state pose a substantial risk of causing him unnecessary pain and suffering during his execution, and sought a stay of execution and injunctive relief. After exhausting all available state court remedies, Jones turned to the federal court for relief. The case had a lengthy history, with Jones first being convicted and sentenced to death in 1984. Multiple appeals and petitions for post-conviction relief followed, and Jones eventually filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus, which was denied. He then filed a petition for certiorari with the Supreme Court, which was still pending. The Alabama Department of Corrections is responsible for carrying out executions at the Holman Correctional Facility, but the specific drugs and procedures used are kept confidential. Jones believed that Alabama uses a combination of drugs, including Thiopental, Pavulon, and Potassium Chloride,",0.3726,0.5,0.427,0.0853,0.1146,0.0978,0.1604,0.2152,0.1838
PN-MI-0013,"This lawsuit was filed on August 31, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs included Detroit Will Breathe (DWB) and fourteen individuals. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel on behalf of the National Lawyers Guild, sued the city of Detroit, Mayor Michael Duggan, Police Chief James Craig, and over one hundred Detroit Police Department (DPD) officers. 

Between May 29, 2020 and August 22, 2020, the plaintiffs participated in protests across Detroit calling for the end of police brutality and racial injustice. The plaintiffs stated that the DPD used excessive force on multiple occasions during the approximately 90 protests that the plaintiffs engaged in during this time period. These instances of excessive force included police driving cars into protest leaders on June 28; using dangerous chokeholds and teargas on peaceful protesters on July 10; and using additional pepper spray, teargas, and chokeholds on protestors on August 22. The plaintiffs also alleged alleged that a curfew imposed by the defendants was only enforced against protesters.

The plaintiffs alleged that these actions violated their First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and assembly, and also violated their Fourth Amendment protection against excessive force, arrest without probable cause, and false imprisonment. They also alleged that defendants' actions represented retaliation forbidden under 42 U.S.C. § 1981 and contended that the city of Detroit was liable under the <i>Monell</i> theory of liability. The plaintiffs requested injunctive, monetary, and declaratory relief, including punitive damages, and asked for attorneys' fees and costs. 

The same day that they filed their complaint, the plaintiffs also filed a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction, which would prohibit the DPD from using weapons against peaceful protesters or arresting protesters without probable cause. The plaintiffs also sought basic amenities, such as access to water and the provision of necessary medical attention, be for any protesters that were arrested.

The case was originally assigned to District Judge Robert H. Cleland and Magistrate Judge Anthony P. Patti, but was then reassigned to District Judge Laurie J. Michelson and Magistrate Judge David R. Grand on September 1, 2020.

On September 4, 2020, the court partially granted the request for a temporary restraining order (TRO). 2020 WL 5269789. Judge Michelson enjoined the defendants from using weapons against peaceful protesters, from placing individuals in choke-holds or hitting them with vehicles, from using zip ties or handcuffs in a way that causes injury, and arresting demonstrators without probable cause. The order was to last 14 days. However, the defendants thought that the order was one-sided. They submitted a motion to modify the TRO on the grounds that it would allow protesters to break the law without repercussions. Judge Michelson disagreed. On September 16, Judge Michelson issued an order denying the defendants' request to modify the TRO, holding that the TRO in no way allowed plaintiffs or other protesters to break the law without legal consequences -- DPD was still allowed to arrest those that sought to break the law. 2020 WL 8575150. The parties jointly agreed that police officers would refrain from using weapons (batons, shield, etc.), chemical agents, or chokeholds against protestors, and also agreed not to arrest demonstrators en masse without probable cause.

The defendants answered the complaint and filed a counterclaim on September 25, alleging that the plaintiffs engaged in a civil conspiracy. The defendants sought compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys' fees. The defendants also sought declaratory judgment stating that the plaintiffs defamed Mayor Michael Duggan and multiple police officers.

After the plaintiffs filed a motion to dismiss the defendants' counterclaim, the counterclaim was dismissed on March 10, 2021. Judge Michelson found that the city did not allege that the plaintiffs committed an underlying tort to support the conspiracy allegation, nor did the city allege sufficient factual allegations to sustain a conspiracy charge even if it could proceed without an underlying tort. 

The case remains ongoing.","

Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff sought damages and declaratory relief under 42 U.S.C. §1983, alleging wrongful death and violations of the Eighth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution and the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. §§ 12131-12134. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the defendants’ actions and policies constituted severe and deliberate indifference to the medical needs of her son, who suffered injuries and death as a result of receiving insufficient medical care while incarcerated. 

The plaintiff’s claims were consolidated with those of three other plaintiffs suing the San Juan County Detention Center, for the pretrial and discovery purposes, although the parties agreed that each case was to be tried separately. Two other individual plaintiffs had filed complaints alleging Eighth Amendment violations, ADA violations, negligence, and wrongful death in June 2015. On July 28, 2015, twenty-seven plaintiffs filed their Second Amended Complaint in the District of New Mexico in <i>Burkee v. San Juan</i>.

On August 24, 2015, the consolidated case was assigned to Judge James O. Browning. 

On September 28, the plaintiffs moved for injunctive relief, requesting either that the court order the defendants to provide emergency medical care to the plaintiffs, or appoint an independent medical overseer for the facility. On November 17, the court dismissed all federal claims against the defendants, holding that the plaintiffs’ complaint did not meet the requisite pleading standards. On January 15, 2016, the court denied the motion for preliminary injunction on the grounds that the plaintiffs were unlikely to succeed on the merits of their claim. The plaintiffs each filed an amended complaint on February 29, 2016, alleging violations of the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments as well as state tort claims. 

The lead plaintiff in this case entered into a settlement agreement with the defendants, which was approved by the District Court on September 19, 2016. The details of the settlement were not made publicly available. On September 20, 2016, the court dismissed all claims under the A.D.A. and state law.

On March 31, 2017, Judge Browning denied the San Juan Regional Medical Center's motion to dismiss the nine remaining plaintiffs' IIED claims and motion for summary judgment on the plaintiffs' state law claims. Judge Browning also granted the plaintiffs' August 15, 2016 motion to remand to state court. The court found that the remaining plaintiffs' federal claims had already been dismissed, and it declined to exercise its supplemental jurisdiction over the remaining state law claims, remanding the case to the Eleventh Judicial District Court, San Juan County, New Mexico.

The parties reached a partial agreement, which the court approved in a consent decree, to remove the requirement for the June 23, 2020 elections. On August 5, the parties came to an agreement to stop enforcement of the witness requirement for the November 3 General Election and collectively sought approval of a partial consent judgment, which the court approved on August 21. The case is ongoing. <hr>

On April 17, 2020, the League of Women Voters of Virginia and three individual voters filed a complaint against the Virginia State Board of Elections to remove Virginia’s witness requirement in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Virginia. Represented by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) and ACLU of Virginia, the plaintiffs brought this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1983 and 1988, 52 U.S.C. § 10302 and 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for violation of their First and Fourteenth Amendment rights and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.  Specifically, they alleged that requiring absentee ballots to be marked in the presence of a witness was contrary to social distancing guidelines and that forcing voters to comply amid the COVID-19 pandemic unduly burdened the fundamental right to vote by forcing voters to choose between their safety and right to vote. Additionally, they alleged that the requirement disproportionately discriminated against elderly voters, African American voters, and voters with disabilities who face a heightened risk of illness from COVID-19. The case was assigned to Judge Norman K. Moon. 

On April 21, the plaintiffs filed a motion for preliminary injunction that would: (1) prohibit the defendants from enforcing the witness requirement for the June 23 primary and all subsequent elections; (2) order the defendants to issue guidance instructing city and county election officials to count otherwise validly cast absentee ballots that are missing a witness signature for the June 23 primary election; (3) order the defendants to conduct a public campaign informing Virginia voters about the elimination of the requirement. 

On April 23, a group of three individuals filed a motion to intervene as defendants. The next day, the Republican Party of Virginia (RPV) and another group of three voters also filed a motion to intervene. The following day, all of the individuals' requests to intervene were denied because they would unnecessarily expand the scope of the litigation and detract from timely resolution. 2020 WL 2090679. However, the RPV’s motion to intervene was granted. 2020 WL 2090678.

On April 27, the parties filed a joint motion for a partial consent decree, agreeing to withdraw the preliminary injunction motion in exchange for the defendant’s agreement to forego enforcement of the witness requirement for the June Primary. 

On May 5, Judge Moon approved the partial consent decree. 2020 WL 2158249. The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Robert S. Ballou for all nondispositive pretrial motions and issues.

On June 19, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint with one of the named plaintiffs removed. On July 17, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint with three additional plaintiffs who were at higher risk from COVID-19 due to underlying medical conditions. 

The plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction for the upcoming November 3 election and other subsequent elections affected by COVID-19 on July 23.

On August 5, the parties came to an agreement to stop enforcement of the witness requirement for the November 3 General Election and collectively sought approval of a partial consent judgment. The district court approved the second consent judgment and decree on August 21, finding that the same reasons for the previous consent decree carried even more force, as the pandemic has resurged. 2020 WL 4927524.

This document, titled ""Partial Consent Judgment and Decree,"" is the result of the case of League of Women Voters of Virginia et al v. Virginia State Board of Elections et al, which centered around a challenge to the witness requirement for absentee ballots in Virginia. The plaintiffs, represented by the League of Women Voters of Virginia and individual voters, argued that this requirement violated their constitutional rights and could potentially disenfranchise voters during the COVID-19 pandemic. The defendants, including the Virginia State Board of Elections and the Department of Elections, initially defended the requirement, but eventually reached a proposed consent decree with the plaintiffs for the June Primary election. However, when the plaintiffs filed a motion for a preliminary injunction for the November election, the court granted it, prohibiting the enforcement of the witness requirement and requiring election officials to count valid absentee ballots without a witness signature. The defendants were also required to provide updated voting instructions to inform voters of the change.

Petitioners are Muslim Iranian F1 student visa holders who attend the New York University Tandon School of Engineering.  The complaint alleged that CBP detained the plaintiffs solely pursuant to an executive order issued by President Donald Trump on January 27, 2017 suspending entry into the United States of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The complaint further alleged that this executive order was being enforced against them contrary to nationwide federal court stays, including the ones issued in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15590>Darweesh v.

The plaintiffs, represented by the Southern Poverty Law Center and private counsel, sought a declaratory judgment, injunctive relief, and attorneys' fees, alleging that the defendants' policies discriminated against non-U.S. citizens trying to obtain a marriage license in Alabama.  

In Alabama, no person may marry without a marriage license.  One of a probate judge's ministerial jobs is to issue marriage licenses to those couples that meet the requirements.  Alabama law states that the parties issuing the marriage license must obtain the Social Security Number of the individuals getting married and have it appear in the marriage license and certificate.  In 2008, the Alabama Attorney General, issued a statement saying that a Social Security Number or other proofs of citizenship were not required to obtain a marriage license.  The Attorney General ordered the probate offices to instead allow people trying to get married the opportunity to submit an affidavit saying they do not have a Social Security Number.

The defendant argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing since they did not apply for a marriage license and thus did not suffer any type of injury.  However, the District Court (Judge Watkins) did not buy this argument since Judge McKinney, Jr. had a clear policy of requiring non-citizens who wanted to get a marriage license to provide proof of legal status.  The District Court (Judge Watkins) thus found that the plaintiffs were effectively barred from applying for a marriage license and that applying for it would have been futile.  On September 25, 2012, the District Court (Judge Watkins) denied the plaintiffs' motion for class certification so on December 7, 2012, the plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint.  

On June 3, 2013, the District Court (Judge William Keith Watkins) entered a protective order assuring the confidentiality of certain information disclosed by both parties.  On June 11, 2013, the District Court (Judge Watkins) granted Defendant Probate Judge Reed's motion to dismiss any claims against him.  Judge Reed argued that his probate office did not require proof of citizenship prior to issuing marriage licenses, and that he was actually willing to give the plaintiffs their marriage licenses if they had applied for it.  Judge McKinney, Jr.'s prior policy was repealed and so the District Court (Judge Watkins) found that the plaintiffs no longer had standing.  

On August 19, 2013, the District Court (Judge William Keith Watkins) approved the parties' joint stipulation of dismissal.  As part of the agreement, the official Probate County's marriage policy was amended and published so that it was clear that there were no citizenship requirements, including a Social Security Number, to obtaining a marriage license.  ","

This case, officially titled 2:11-cv-00979-WKW-WC, is a class action lawsuit filed by Charelle Loder, Jack Doe, Jane Doe, and James Doe against Reese McKinney, Jr. and other probate judges in Alabama. The plaintiffs, represented by experienced attorneys, are challenging the defendants' policies that deny marriage licenses to individuals lacking proof of lawful immigration status. The plaintiffs argue that this policy violates their constitutional rights and seek declaratory and injunctive relief on behalf of themselves and a proposed class of individuals in Alabama. The first couple, Charelle Loder and Jack Doe, are a US citizen and a Haitian citizen who have been together for five years and want to get married. The second couple, Jane Doe and James Doe, are both Mexican citizens who have been together for ten years and have a child. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants' policies not only interfere with their fundamental right to marry, but also discriminate against them based on their immigration status.

The plaintiffs are represented by experienced attorneys with expertise in class action and immigration law, including Samuel J. Brooke and Sigfredo Rubio. The defendants, represented by their respective probate judges, have enforced policies that deny marriage licenses to individuals without proof of",0.5825,0.2335,0.3333,0.1805,0.0721,0.1031,0.2524,0.1012,0.1444
FH-DC-0011,"On March 15, 2011, a group of Hispanic farmers and ranchers brought suit against the United States and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, were potential claimants in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12757"">the proposed settlement agreement in <i>Garcia v. Vilsack</i></a>, an earlier case in which a group of Hispanic farmers and ranchers filed suit against the USDA, claiming that the USDA had systematically denied Hispanics farmers and ranchers loans and loan servicing in the 1990s.  In this case, the plaintiffs claimed that the defendants had violated their Fifth Amendment equal protection and due process rights by offering a settlement agreement unequal to the settlement agreement offered to <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12515"">African American</a>, <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12657"">Native American</a>, and women farmers and ranchers who had previously sued the USDA over similar discrimination. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the proposed settlement agreement was unequal in comparison to the other discrimination settlements because it did not provide judicial supervision (leading to deficient notice and defective claims processes); did not provide assistance of class counsel; provided disproportionate monetary relief (only $1.33 billion, compared to the $2.23 billion in the African American discrimination case, despite Hispanic farmers outnumbering African American farmers 12 to 1); required additional proof elements in the claims process; and did not propose compensation for non-credit farm benefits. The plaintiff filed under the Declaratory Judgment Act and the Administrative Procedures Act. They sought a declaration that this settlement proposal violated the plaintiff's constitutional rights and a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from engaging in racially discriminatory treatment of Hispanic farmers by treating them differently in comparison to African American, Native American, and women farmers with similar complaints.

On March 25, 2011, the plaintiffs filed papers for a putative class of plaintiffs in the <i>Garcia</i> case, who allegedly ""were subjected to, and continue to be subject to, USDA discrimination in its farm benefit programs"" and who ""are potential claimants"" under the defendants' administrative claim process for Hispanic farmers.

On May 11, 2011, the US moved to dismiss the case, denying any unlawful conduct and stating that the plaintiffs lacked standing, were attempting improper claim splitting, and were time barred. The plaintiffs moved to certify the class on June 11, 2011, and the defendant moved on June 14 to stay the certification motion pending adjudication of the motion to dismiss.  On November 11, 2011, Judge Reggie B. Walton entered an order asking parties to clarify whether the plaintiffs' claims were ripe, given that the settlement agreement in <i>Garcia</i> had not been formally proposed.  On December 21, 2011, Judge Walton entered an order denying all extant motions without prejudice, and holding the case in abeyance pending an announcement of the final version of Defendants' ADR program, because this suit would be unripe until the settlement agreement was formally proposed.

On January 20, 2012, the defendants in the <i>Garcia</i> case submitted the proposed framework for the settlement agreement. Based on the proposal, the plaintiffs in this case submitted a first amended complaint on April 13, 2012, and Judge Walton lifted the stay on the case on August 24, 2012. The defendant then moved to dismiss the amended complaint on September 24, 2012. On December 11, 2012, Judge Walton granted the defendants' motion to dismiss, ruling that there was no injury because participation in the administrative claims process was optional, and that the suit lacked redressability because the court had no way of compelling the government to propose a specific settlement agreement. 908 F. Supp. 2d 146.

On February 15, 2013, the plaintiffs entered a notice of appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (docket no. 13-05044). The Circuit court heard oral arguments from the parties more than a year later on May 7, 2014. In its opinion, the appellate court agreed that the plaintiffs' prayer for relief overreached because the court could not coerce a party, especially an Executive Branch agency, to settle in a case. Therefore, the district court correctly held that it lacked authority to enjoin the government to offer class settlement such as in previous cases. However, the appeals court reversed the lower court's decision and remanded the case on May 27, 2014 because the district court could have granted relief in the form of an injunction ordering the government not to act on unlawful racial grounds toward Hispanic and female farmers. 

While the parties litigated the case in district court on remand, the defendant filed a new motion on November 25, 2014 to dismiss on the grounds that the court lacked subject matter jurisdiction and that the complaint failed to state a valid claim. In response to the defendant's motion, the district court officially reopened the case on May 14, 2015.

On October 26, 2015, the defendant filed a status report regarding the voluntary alternative dispute resolution (ADR) program established for farmers alleging discrimination against Hispanic and female individuals in making or servicing farm loans. The Claims Adjudicator approved a total of 3,210 claims in the ADR program. On October 23, 2015, USDA reported as a total of 2,847 of the approved claims had been paid by the Judgment Fund, and another 126 claims were in process.

Months later, Judge Walton granted the defendant's renewed motion to dismiss the case. When the defendant moved to dismiss in November 2014, Judge Walton found that in light of the appeals court's agreement that a court cannot order a party to settle, only the plaintiffs' equal protection claim remained. Judge Walton reasoned that the plaintiffs' other claims related to specific terms of the ADR and therefore the court did not have the authority to adjudicate those issues.

In relation to plaintiffs' equal protection claim, the defendant contended that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim because the complaint did not allege facts showing that the defendant had a discriminatory purpose in settling claims brought by hispanic or female farmers. Judge Walton agreed with the defendant and dismissed the case in March 2016, closing the case.","

This document, titled ""Cantu et al v. United States of America et al,"" is a class action lawsuit filed by six individuals, including David Cantu, Guadalupe Garcia, Noe Obregon, Ruperto Rodriguez, Modesto Rodriguez, and Modesta Salazar, against the United States government, the Department of Justice, the Department of Agriculture, Attorney General Eric Holder, and Secretary of Agriculture Tom Vilsack. The plaintiffs, represented by a team of attorneys including Jonathan D. Kossak, Laura G. Ferguson, Richard A. Hibey, Robert F. Ruyak, and Stephen S. Hill, allege discrimination in the administration of farm benefit programs based on race and gender. They claim that the government's claims resolution process is discriminatory compared to similar processes provided to other minority farmers. The plaintiffs seek a declaration that this discrimination violates their Fifth Amendment rights and the Administrative Procedure Act, as well as an injunction to prevent further discrimination and receive a settlement equivalent to those received by other farmers. The case was initially assigned to Judge Richard W. Roberts, but was later reassigned to Judge Reggie B. Walton. After a series of motions and deadlines, the defendants file a motion to dismiss the case, which is initially denied by the court",0.6364,0.1192,0.2008,0.2335,0.0436,0.0734,0.3485,0.0653,0.11
PN-OR-0004,"This lawsuit, filed on July 21, 2020 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Oregon, was brought by the Western State Center (a public benefit corporation), the First Unitarian Church of Portland, a private individual, and two Oregon State Representatives. Represented by private attorneys, they sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, the U.S. Customs and Border Protection, Federal Protective Service, and the U.S. Marshal Service over the defendants' presence and role in quelling protests that ensued after the police killing of George Floyd in May of 2020.

The complaint alleged violation of the First and Tenth Amendments. The First Amendment claim was brought by First Unitarian Church and argued that the defendants' arrests of protesters were in violation of the First Amendment right to protest, but also in violation of the Free Exercise clause, as protest was an integral part of the church's philosophy. The Tenth Amendment claim, brought by all plaintiffs, claimed that the federal agencies' enforcement of law on Portland property (and not just federal property) amounted to an unconstitutional violation of the principles of federalism. Plaintiffs requested declaratory relief, injunctive relief, and attorney's fees and costs. The case was assigned to Judge Michael W. Mosman and Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo.

However, on July 27, the plaintiffs submitted an amended complaint. The amended complaint retained the arguments about free speech, free exercise, and principles of federalism, but added other claims regarding the Fourth Amendment. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the federal agents were arresting Portland residents without probable cause, adding that some of these arrests were caught on video. Protesters were taken off the street by non-uniformed federal officers and hauled into unmarked vans. 

Two days later the plaintiffs submitted a motion for a temporary restraining order with an expedited hearing and a motion for a preliminary injunction. However, on August 4 the court granted an email request to withdraw the motion for a temporary restraining order as moot. This is probably because the court had already granted a TRO against against federal agents in Portland in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17707&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BcaseName%7CIndex%20Newspapers%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B><i>Index Newspapers</i></a> earlier in the week. The plaintiffs continued to seek a preliminary injunction.

On October 22 and 30, the court held oral argument on the motion for a preliminary injunction. Judge Mosman granted the preliminary injunction with respect to the First Amendment claims, but denied the preliminary injunction with respect to the Tenth Amendment claim. 2020 WL 6555054. While Judge Mosman found no showing that the federal agents acted with retaliatory motive, he found that the President and Acting Secretary Chad Wolf expressed such a motivation and the plaintiffs were entitled to some form of injunctive relief. Under the preliminary injunction, Judge Mosman limited the defendants from engaging in crowd control beyond an extended city block around the U.S. Courthouse. 

The defendants promptly appealed to the Ninth Circuit (docket no. 20-35959) and requested a stay pending appeal. The Ninth Circuit denied the defendants' emergency motion for a stay pending appeal without prejudice to renewal after the district court ruled on the motion to stay pending appeal. Then on November 9, 2020, the court held a status conference and vacated the order for the preliminary injunction as no longer necessary. The defendants subsequently dismissed the appeal.

On December 4, 2020, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and failure to state a claim. They argued that the plaintiffs did not have standing because the plaintiffs did not attend the protest and the feared injuries were not injuries in fact or traceable to federal agents' conduct. In addition, they argued that the First Amendment allegations were actually weaker than what was considered in the preliminary injunction motion. The defendants also requested a stay of discovery.

The parties then consented to proceed before Magistrate Judge Jolie A. Russo. Magistrate Judge Russo extended the discovery deadline to November 30, 2021. As of December 30, 2020, the motions to dismiss and stay discovery remained pending. This case is ongoing.

This document, Case 3:20-cv-01175-JR Document 14 Filed 07/27/20 Page 17 of 36, is a motion for a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction filed by multiple plaintiffs, including individuals and organizations, against the federal government. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from Snell & Wilmer L.L.P. and Perkins Coie, are seeking relief from the federal government's actions in Portland, Oregon, specifically the deployment of federal agents to suppress protests against police brutality and in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. The defendants in this case are the Department of Homeland Security, Customs and Border Protection, Federal Protective Service, and the United States Marshals Service. The plaintiffs allege that the federal government's actions, which include the use of excessive force and targeting of peaceful protesters and journalists, violate their constitutional rights under the First, Fourth, and Tenth Amendments. They are seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction to stop the implementation of Operation Legend, a federal law enforcement program aimed at addressing violent crime in certain cities, including Portland.

The court proceedings involved the presentation of evidence and arguments from both the plaintiffs and the defendants. The plaintiffs argued that the federal government's actions in Portland, specifically the use of tear gas",0.6509,0.1991,0.305,0.2512,0.0766,0.1174,0.3302,0.101,0.1547
IM-IL-0024,"This case is one of several brought nationwide by States, counties, and nonprofit organizations challenging the Trump administration's revised, final public charge rule, which expands the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. In the fall of 2019, district court judges from across the country granted preliminary injunctions enjoining the government from implementing the public charge rule. But after multiple Circuit Courts and the Supreme Court issued stays of these injunctions, the public charge rule was implemented by the government on February 24, 2020. The District Court in this case issued a judgment vacating the public charge rule. The Seventh Circuit stayed the order pending appeal and petition for certiorari. In addition, on February 2, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule. A little over a month later on March 9, 2021, DHS officially abandoned the rule and the petitions for certiorari were voluntarily dismissed by the government.

<u>Cook County Sues Over the Public Charge Rule</u>
On September 23, 2019, Cook County, Illinois, and the Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights, Inc., represented by private counsel, filed this suit in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its acting secretary in his official capacity, and United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and its acting secretary in his official capacity, under the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). The plaintiffs sought relief to declare the Department of Homeland Security’s Final Rule (""the Rule"") unlawful and invalid due to violations of the APA and unconstitutional due to violations of the Equal Protection Clause. The plaintiffs also sought to preliminarily and permanently enjoin the Rule from being enforced in the state of Illinois.

On August 14, 2019, the DHS published a <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2019/08/14/2019-17142/inadmissibility-on-public-charge-grounds"">revised, final public charge rule</a>, which defines personal circumstances that affect the ability of individuals and their families to successfully enter the U.S. or acquire legal permanent resident status (i.e., get a green card). The final rule increases the types of programs that the federal government will consider in public charge determinations to now also include previously excluded health, nutrition, and housing programs. The Immigration and Nationality Act provides that if an immigration officer finds that a person seeking a visa is likely to become a public charge, that person is “inadmissible.” Thus, an immigrant who uses non-cash benefits such as food stamps or Medicaid may be found more likely to be a public charge and inadmissible for purposes of a visa or green card application. The plaintiffs asserted that the effect of this Rule would be to force immigrant families to choose between using these benefits or risk failing to gain permanent resident status.

The plaintiffs contended that the defendants violated the APA in exceeding their statutory authority by redefining the term ""public charge"" and contravened existing law by considering public benefits that have been explicitly and repeatedly excluded from public charge determinations. Furthermore, the plaintiffs claimed that that Rule was arbitrary and capricious because defendants failed to justify their departure from settled practice, failed to adequately consider the Rule's varied and extensive harms, and because the Rule's complex rules will lead to arbitrary enforcement. The plaintiffs also argued that the Rule violated the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 by discriminating against people with disabilities and that the Rule violated the Equal Protection Clause of the Fifth Amendment. 

Additionally, the plaintiffs asserted that the Rule would have a chilling effect on immigrant communities, ""causing individuals to forgo critical public benefits—an impact that will cause devastating, irreparable harm to children, families, and public health in Cook County and throughout Illinois."" The plaintiffs argued that immigrant families will disenroll in federal health and assistance programs, leading to adverse health, economic, and productivity results, and placing a heavy burden and strain on County agencies and programs. 

<u>The Plaintiffs Seek a Temporary Restraining Order and/or Preliminary Injunction</u>
On September 25, 2019, after originally being assigned to Judge John Robert Blakey, the case was reassigned to Judge Gary Feinerman. On the same day, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for temporary restraining order and/or preliminary injunction (PI) or stay. With the Rule set to go in effect on October 15, 2019, the plaintiffs sought immediate injunctive relief or a stay enjoining the defendants from implementing the Rule. The plaintiffs claimed that they were likely to succeed on their claim under the APA, that they would suffer irreparable harm absent immediate injunctive relief, and that the balance of equities and public interest weighed strongly in favor of an immediate injunction or stay to maintain the status quo.

On October 8, 2019, the defendants filed an opposition to the plaintiffs' emergency motion. The defendants argued that the court should deny the motion because the plaintiffs were a governmental entity and a group of organizations serving immigrants, rather than persons actually affected by the rule, and thus cannot meet jurisdictional requirements. The defendants also asserted that the plaintiffs' claims were meritless, that ""the Rule accords with the longstanding meaning of 'public charge' and complies with the APA"" and that plaintiffs' ""disagreements are ultimately with the wisdom of the policy, a judgment allocated to the political branches.""

A few days later the defendants filed a supplemental memorandum in opposition to the plaintiffs' emergency motion. On October 11, orders by the United States District Courts for the Southern District of New York and Eastern District of Washington preliminarily enjoined the defendants from implementing the Rule nationwide, including Illinois. The defendants asserted that the plaintiffs could no longer claim that they will suffer irreparable harm absent a PI and thus a PI at this time is inappropriate. 

<u>District Court Grants a Preliminary Injunction</u>
Notwithstanding these nationwide PIs, on October 14, 2019, Judge Feinerman granted the plaintiffs' motion and enjoined the defendants from implementing the Rule in the State of Illinois. Judge Feinerman concluded that the plaintiffs were likely to succeed on their claim that the Rule conflicts with the Supreme Court’s formulation of public charge, in violation of the APA. Judge Feinerman further concluded that the plaintiffs have demonstrated irreparable harm in the absence of a PI and that the balance of harms favors the plaintiffs. 417 F.Supp.3d 1008.

Soon after, on October 25, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to stay the PI pending appeal. The defendants argued that they were likely to succeed on appeal and that they would suffer irreparable harm absent a stay from being compelled to grant lawful permanent residence to persons who would likely become a public charge under the Rule. The defendants appealed the PI to the Seventh Circuit on October 30, 2019. Judge Feinerman denied the defendants' motion on November 14, 2019.

On December 23, 2019, a Seventh Circuit panel denied the defendants' motion to stay the PI pending appeal. The Seventh Circuit's decision was in contrast to a Ninth Circuit order staying a nationwide PI, which also enjoined the implementation of the Rule, pending appeal. 

<u>Defendants' Motion to Dismiss</u>
Back in the district court, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on January 16, 2020. The defendants argued that in light of a Ninth Circuit opinion concluding that the Rule falls within the defendants' discretion to interpret and implement the meaning of public charge and that the Supreme Court has not set a fixed definition of public charge, the plaintiffs' complaint should be dismissed. Plaintiffs, in opposition to the motion, maintained that the Rule ""is inconsistent with the plain meaning of the statutory text, and DHS does not, and cannot, offer justification for this transformation of well-settled law"" and will impose significant costs on the plaintiffs. 

<u>The Supreme Court Stays All Nationwide Injunctions Enjoining Implementation of the Public Charge Rule, but Not Illinois' Injunction</u>
The Supreme Court weighed in to provide clarity to the several, overlapping PIs enjoining the implementation of the Rule that had been issued across the country. On January 27, 2020, ruling in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287"">State of New York v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security</a>, Justice Gorsuch stayed the Southern District of New York's nationwide PI regarding the Rule, concluding that the ""routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these conflicting decisions."" However, the Supreme Court declined to stay the Northern District of Illinois' PI because it applied only to the state of Illinois. 140 S. Ct. 599.

<u>Defendants Renew Efforts to Seek a Stay of the Injunction</u>
Following the Supreme Court's order to stay the nationwide PI, on January 28, 2020, the defendants filed a renewed motion to the Seventh Circuit to stay the district court's PI. The defendants argued that ""in light of the Supreme Court's decision holding that a stay pending appeal of injunctions against enforcement of this Rule is appropriate,"" the Seventh Circuit should issue a stay pending appeal to allow the Rule to go into effect in Illinois. A Seventh Circuit panel denied the renewed motion for stay on February 10, 2020, without issuing an opinion or explanation for its conclusion. Instead, the Seventh Circuit issued an expedited briefing schedule to ensure prompt consideration of the PI. 

On February 13, 2020, the defendants filed an application to the Supreme Court for a stay pending appeal. The defendants contended that the Seventh Circuit ""stands alone in finding a stay unwarranted;"" the Fourth and Ninth Circuits, along with the Supreme Court in an appeal pending in the Second Circuit, stayed ""materially identical"" PIs. The defendants further asserted that, even though the PI here was distinguishable because it was not nationwide, the Supreme Court indicated in its January 27 order that ""challenges to the Rule will be unsuccessful and that even a more limited injunction would impose irreparable harm on the government."" 

<u>The Supreme Court Stays Illinois' Injunction Pending the Seventh Circuit Ruling and a Writ of Certiorari</u>
On February 21, 2020, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, granted the defendants' application for stay and issued an order staying the district court's PI pending disposition of the appeal in the Seventh Circuit and disposition on defendants' timely petition for a writ of certiorari. The majority did not file an opinion in support of its decision. Justice Sotomayor, dissenting, concluded that ""the Government’s only claimed hardship is that it must enforce an existing interpretation of an immigration rule in one State—just as it has done for the past 20 years—while an updated version of the rule takes effect in the remaining 49,"" which was not enough to satisfy its ""especially heavy burden."" 140 S. Ct. 681.

<u>The District Court Denies Defendants' Motion to Dismiss</u>
On May 19, Judge Feinerman issued a memorandum opinion and order denying defendants' motion to dismiss and concluding that plaintiffs are entitled to discovery on its equal protection claim. First, Judge Feinerman denied defendants' claims that plaintiffs ""lack standing or fall outside the pertinent zone of interests, that this suit is not ripe, or that the APA claims fail as a matter of law,"" as the court already addressed those issues in its preliminary injunction opinion. Moreover, Judge Feinerman found that plaintiffs' equal protection claim survived dismissal, as the allegation ""that the Final Rule’s disproportionate impact on nonwhite immigrants motivated its promulgation is eminently plausible."" Judge Feinerman further concluded that extra-record discovery on plaintiffs' equal protection claim was justified because plaintiffs' made a ""strong showing that the Rule was developed and promulgated 'at least in part because of' a substantial and impermissible reason not reflected in the administrative record—the Rule’s disproportionate 'adverse effects upon' nonwhite immigrants.""

<u>The Seventh Circuit Affirms the Preliminary Injunction</u>
On June 10, a Seventh Circuit panel (Circuit Judges Diane Wood, Ilana Rovner, and Amy Coney Barrett) issued a ruling affirming the preliminary injunction. 962 F.3d 208. Writing for a 2-1 majority, Judge Wood held that (1) the county had standing to sue; (2) DHS's interpretation of the rule fell outside the boundaries set by the statute; and (3) the public charge rule was likely to be arbitrary and capricious.

Judge Barrett dissented, writing that DHS's interpretation of the public charge rule did not fall outside the boundaries set by the statute. She did not comment on the rule being likely to fail the arbitrary and capricious standard, however, because the district court didn't address it and plaintiffs barely briefed it.

The stay remained, however, as defendants still had the chance to file a petition for a writ of certiorari.

<u>Defendants' Appeal is Denied, as is their Petition to Rehear</u>
In response to the ruling on the motion to dismiss, defendants asked the district court to certify for interlocutory appeal the denial of the motion to dismiss on June 10. Defendants argued that dismissal of plaintiffs' equal protection claim would avoid difficult issues of executive privilege arising from plaintiff's extra-record discovery. On July 14, Judge Feinerman declined to certify the order for interlocutory appeal. He found that, even if plaintiffs' equal protection claim were dismissed, plaintiffs would still be entitled to the same discovery from their APA claims.

On July 27, defendants filed a petition for the Seventh Circuit to rehear their appeal of the preliminary injunction <i>en banc</i>. The Seventh Circuit denied their petition on August 12. On October 7, 2020, defendants filed a petition for writ of certiorari with the Supreme Court. 

<u>Public Charge Rule is Vacated Following Plaintiffs' Successful Motion for Summary Judgment on APA Claim</u>
On August 31, plaintiffs moved for summary judgment on the APA claim. Relying on the Seventh Circuit's affirmance of the preliminary injunction, they argued that they should win on the APA claim while the equal protection claim proceeds in court. They further argued that the public charge rule should be vacated as a result. Defendants conceded that plaintiffs were likely to win on the APA claim, but argued that the injunction should only be lifted for the State of Illinois.

On November 2, Judge Feinerman issued an order granting plaintiffs' motion and vacating the public charge rule nationwide. He agreed that the Seventh Circuit had effectively argued the merits of the APA claim, and held vacatur to be an appropriate remedy for a rule that violated the APA.

<u>Order Vacating the Rule is Stayed Pending Appeal and Petition for Certiorari</u>
Immediately after the ruling, defendants moved to stay the district court's vacatur of the public charge rule pending appeal. The Seventh Circuit granted defendants' motion on November 3.

On November 19, the Seventh Circuit further ordered that the appeal of the order would be suspended pending the Supreme Court's resolution of defendants' petition for a writ of certiorari on the preliminary injunction.

<u>The Rule is Officially Abandoned and Vacated</u>
On January 22, 2021, two days after President Biden's inauguration, Judge Feinerman requested a status report from the new defendants addressing whether they plan to pursue their Seventh Circuit appeal or petition for certiorari. The status hearing was originally set for February 8, but was moved to February 26.

On February 2, President Biden issued an Executive Order calling for DHS to review agency actions related to the implementation of the public charge rule.

On March 9, 2021, <a href=""https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/03/09/dhs-secretary-statement-2019-public-charge-rule"">DHS formally abandoned the rule</a>. The government voluntarily dismissed its appeal to the Seventh Circuit, lifting the stay of the November 2, 2020 decision vacating the Public Charge Final Rule nationwide. That same day, at all parties' requests, the Supreme Court dismissed the pending petition from this case, as well as a similar petition for the Second Circuit (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17287""><i>New York v. DHS</i></a>) and the Ninth Circuit (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17409""><i>San Francisco v. USCIS</i></a>).

On March 10, eleven state attorneys general, led by Ken Paxton of Texas, moved to intervene as defendants in the Seventh Circuit. They filed similar motions in the Ninth and Fourth Circuits, and a day later on March 11, they filed an <a href=""https://www.supremecourt.gov/DocketPDF/20/20A150/172422/20210319132528733_20A__%20Application.pdf"">emergency application</a> to the Supreme Court to intervene on behalf of the government and stay the judgment from <i>Cook County</i>.

Despite the motion to intervene in the Seventh Circuit, on March 12, Judge Feinerman approved a stipulation by both parties to voluntarily dismiss the lawsuit, closing the civil case. The Seventh Circuit then went on to deny the states' motion to intervene 3 days later, on March 15.

As of April 15, 2021, the Public Charge Final Rule has been abandoned and vacated nationwide. The case has been closed in the district court. However, the application by the states to intervene in the Supreme Court remains open.","

The administrative record provided by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in the case of Illinois Coalition for Immigrant and Refugee Rights (ICIRR) v. DHS is a collection of individual summaries from different segments of the original document, known as the Final Rule. The Final Rule, implemented by DHS, is a controversial policy that aims to limit immigration by individuals of color. ICIRR, a nonprofit organization advocating for the rights of immigrants and refugees, filed a lawsuit against DHS, arguing that the Final Rule violates the equal protection clause of the Constitution by discriminating against nonwhite immigrants. The plaintiffs are represented by a team of attorneys from the National Immigrant Justice Center, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the Mayer Brown law firm.

In response to the lawsuit, DHS has argued that if the equal protection claim is dismissed, there would be no need for further discovery and the scope of the litigation could be narrowed. However, the court has rejected this argument, stating that the plaintiffs are entitled to discovery in connection with their Administrative Procedure Act (APA) claims. These claims allege that the Final Rule is a pretext for discrimination against immigrants of color, and the court believes that extra-record discovery is necessary to fully understand the motivations behind the rule.

IM-NY-0071,"On September 25, 2019, the State of New York and the Kings County District Attorney filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) and the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS). Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs challenged the federal government’s new directive authorizing civil immigration arrests in and around New York State courthouses (“the Directive”). The plaintiffs sought injunctive and declaratory relief, alleging that the Directive violates the Administrative Procedure Act (APA) and the Tenth Amendment. The case was assigned to Judge Jed S. Rakoff. 

In their complaint, the plaintiffs stated that prior to a January 2018 ICE directive addressing “Civil Immigration Enforcement Actions Inside Courthouses,” there was a longstanding practice of avoiding civil immigration arrests in and around state courthouses. And, because New York recognizes a common-law privilege against civil arrests in, or while traveling to or from, courthouses, the plaintiffs argued that the Directive, which generally authorizes such arrests, violates the APA by exceeding ICE’s statutory authority. The plaintiffs also claimed that the Directive is arbitrary and capricious in violation of the APA because it was issued absent adequate justification or explanation. 

Next, the plaintiffs alleged that implementation of the Directive disrupts the effective functioning of the State’s court system, deters victims and witnesses from assisting law enforcement and vindicating their rights, hinders criminal prosecution, and undermines public safety. The plaintiffs also noted that ICE enforcement actions at New York State courthouses had “skyrocketed” since the Directive was issued, and that such enforcement had significantly chilled participation in the courts. Thus, the plaintiffs argued that the Directive violates the Tenth Amendment by impermissibly interfering with New York’s right to form its own government by disrupting state court operations and impeding criminal prosecutions. 

On October 23, 2019, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss. The defendants claimed that the Directive is unreviewable under the APA, there is no federal common-law immunity from immigration enforcement for those who are subject to ICE arrest, and that the Directive does not implicate the Tenth Amendment because it does not command or compel state actors to take any action.

On December 19, 2019, the district court denied the defendants’ motion to dismiss with respect to all of the plaintiffs’ claims for relief. First, Judge Rakoff found that the Directive was final agency action subject to judicial review. Next, he held that the common-law privilege against civil courthouse arrests applies to immigration arrests, and has not been displaced by federal immigration law. Finally, he found that the facts presented demonstrate that ICE has commandeered state and local judges and court officials not to take action in response to ICE courthouse arrests, even when such arrests cause great disruption and state agents would therefore normally intervene. 431 F.Supp.3d 377.

The plaintiffs filed a motion for summary judgment on March 13, 2020. The motion was accompanied by three amicus briefs: one from former nominee to be U.S. Attorney General for Civil Rights and Commissioner of the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights Debo Adegbile, another from Harvard Law Professor Nikolas Bowie, and a third from the New York Bar Association.

Judge Rakoff granted the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment on June 10, 2020. He held that the Immigration and Nationality Act incorporated the English common law rule preventing service and arrest on people in or traveling to a courthouse. He also ruled that the policy change violated the APA's arbitrary and capricious review standard. He was not persuaded by the defendants' arguments that executive orders and policy directives from DHS effectively mandated that arrests must be carried out in courthouses because the orders mandated no such thing. In granting the summary judgment motion, Judge Rakoff also granted the motion for declaratory and injunctive relief and enjoined ICE from carrying out any civil arrests in New York courthouses. 2020 WL 3067715.

On August 7, 2020, the defendants appealed to the Second Circuit. As of December 23, 2020, the appeal is pending.","

The document in question, titled ""University of California v. U.S. Department of Homeland Security,"" provides a comprehensive overview of a case where the plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the ACLU, challenged the policy of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to conduct civil immigration arrests in New York State courthouses. The defendants, represented by attorneys from the Department of Justice, argue that this policy is in line with an executive order and implementing memo from 2017. However, the court found that these documents did not explicitly mention courthouse arrests and therefore did not justify the significant policy change. The court also noted that ICE did not provide a reasonable explanation for the change, making it arbitrary and capricious in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act. As a result, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment and issued an injunction to prevent ICE from conducting civil arrests in courthouses. This case highlights the importance of legislative history and the need for agencies to provide a reasonable explanation for policy changes, particularly in matters that could significantly impact individuals' rights. The plaintiffs, the University of California, joined by various organizations and individuals, argued that the policy change violated the common law privilege against courthouse arrests and the Fourth and Fifth Amendments of the US Constitution.

EE-CO-0006,"In September 2005, the EEOC district office in Denver, Colorado brought this suit against the Acepex Management Corporation, an office janitorial service, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. The complaints alleged that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by discriminating against a female employee because of her sex.  Specifically, she alleged that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by a supervisor, exposed to degrading cartoons, and discharged for complaining about the assaults and participating in the police investigation.  The charging party intervened in the case. After extensive discovery and a terminated motion for consolidation, the parties settled the case and a consent decree was entered in October 2006.

In the consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would pay the aggrieved party $190,000 in compensatory damages and attorneys fees, refrain from retaliating and discriminating based on sex, issue positive references, implement an anti-discrimination policy, post and distribute its new policy, provide EEO training to ALL its staff, post an EEO notice, provide all employee postings and handbooks in Spanish and English, and submit semiannual complaint/compliance reports to the EEOC. The decree was valid for three years. The docket does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2009.

This document is a comprehensive report detailing the court case between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Acepex Management Corporation, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The lawsuit was initiated by the EEOC against Acepex, with lead attorney Karron D. Combs representing the plaintiffs. The EEOC alleged that Acepex had a discriminatory policy in place, resulting in unequal employment opportunities and retaliatory actions against employees who spoke out against discriminatory practices. The defendant, represented by a team of attorneys including Rita Byrnes Kittle, Mary Jo O'Neill, John S. Evangelisti, and Henry Rhee, denied these allegations.

The court proceedings, overseen by Magistrate Judge Craig B. Shaffer and Judge Robert E. Blackburn, began on April 27, 2006 and continued until May 8, 2006. During this time, various motions, orders, and notices were filed, including a dispute over a mental examination of the defendant and a request for an extension of time to file motions regarding expert testimony.

As the case progressed, Acepex filed a motion for a protective order, seeking to safeguard confidential information related to the case. The defendant also submitted a which contains a",0.3802,0.3395,0.3587,0.1152,0.1028,0.1086,0.1979,0.1767,0.1867
JC-OR-0010,"On January 13, 2012, the Prison Legal News (PLN) filed a civil rights lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for Oregon under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against Columbia County. The plaintiff, represented by Human Rights Defense Center and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages, claiming that the defendants' ""postcard only"" and ""no magazine"" policies for inmate mail violated the plaintiff's First Amendment rights, as well as the First Amendment rights of inmates at the Jail and their correspondents. Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that the policy resulted in the unlawful censorship of PLN's books and magazines, which are sent to individual subscribers in custody at the Columbia County Jail. The plaintiff claimed that these mailings were protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments. The plaintiff also alleged the defendants' ""notice and appeal"" policy for rejected inmate mail violated the plaintiff's Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process rights and the procedural due process rights of inmates and their correspondents.

On May 29, 2012, Judge Michael H. Simon granted the plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction in part, holding that the jail's policy likely violated the First Amendment. Judge Simon ordered the defendants to stop restricting all incoming and outgoing inmate personal mail to postcards only and to stop refusing to deliver or process inmate mail solely on the grounds that it is not on a postcard. Prison Legal News v. Columbia Cnty., 2012 WL 1936108 (D. Or. May 29, 2012). Judge Simon rejected the jail's arguments that the policy was rationally related to both safety and the efficient use of the jail's limited resources. 

On September 13, 2012, PLN moved for partial summary judgment on the claims for declaratory and injunctive relief and on the defendants' affirmative defense of failure to mitigate damages. These issues went to two separate trials in 2013: a bench trial and a jury trial. 

From February 5 to February 8 the parties argued before Judge Simon in the bench trial. The defendants argued that the rationale behind the policy was preventing the introduction of contraband and saving time during mail inspection. Following the trial, Judge Simon found that this rationale was not supported by the evidence. This was the first time a postcard-only policy went to trial, so it is the first available legal precedent that can be used in future litigation against postcard-only policies. 

On February 8, after the bench trial, Judge Simon asked the parties to submit post-trial briefing on several issues relating to the plaintiff's request for injunctive relief, including: the legal criteria for a permanent injunction; the application of the trial evidence to the legal standard; whether the Sheriff's credibility and limited political term impact the Court's analysis; and whether the injunction should be permanent or a limited term. 

On April 24, 2013, Judge Simon held that the jail's policy was unconstitutional. Judge Simon issued a Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law and entered the Final Judgment in favor of the plaintiff and against all defendants on May 28, 2013. Judge Simon permanently enjoined the defendants from restricting incoming and outgoing inmate personal mail to postcards only. Judge Simon also declared that inmates have a First Amendment right to receive magazines, and publishers have a First Amendment right to send magazines to inmates and have their magazines delivered. As such, the defendants' policy and custom of prohibiting magazines violated the First Amendment. Judge Simon also declared that that inmates and their unincarcerated correspondents have a Fourteenth Amendment right to procedural due process when the defendants reject their mail and that the defendants must notify an inmate and the unincarcerated correspondent when the defendants reject correspondence written by or addressed to the inmate, including a description of the rejected mail and the basis for the rejection. Prison Legal News v. Columbia Cnty., 942 F. Supp. 2d 1068 (D. Or. 2013). Subsequently, the plaintiffs moved to recover attorney fees and costs. 

On June 25, 2013, the defendants moved for the court to amend its Findings of Fact and Conclusions of Law, as well as for relief from the judgment. They claimed that the plaintiffs lacked standing for the claims, that the claims were moot based off of corrective actions taken, and that the postcard policy is not a violation of the First Amendment. They sought to have the declaratory judgment removed and claimed that the preliminary injunction should be found an unnecessary remedy by the court. On July 31, 2013, the court denied the motions and the findings and conclusions were left in place. The defendants appealed this decision to the Ninth Circuit in August 2013. While the appeal was pending, the court sent the parties to mediation.

On March 24, 2014, Judge Simon in the district court granted the plaintiff's motion for attorney fees in part, awarding the plaintiff a total of $802,176.46 in attorney fees and expenses. 2014 WL 1225100 (D. Or. 2014). The appellate court then stayed its proceedings in order to give the defendants time to appeal the attorney fees decision.

The defendants filed the second appeal in April 2014 and in June 2014, the appeals were consolidated. However, the defendants subsequently moved, unopposed, to dismiss the appeal. The parties may have engaged in settlement talks, but it is unclear why the defendants sought voluntary dismissal. The Ninth Circuit dismissed the appeal with prejudice on July 1, 2014 and the case is now closed. Each party paid its own costs for the appeal.","

The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys Katherine C. Chamberlain and Lance Weber, allege that the defendants violated the First and Fourteenth Amendments by implementing a postcard-only policy and denying due process in the rejection of inmate mail.

The court also granted PLN's application for special admission of attorney Alissa R. Hull. In a final verdict, the court ruled in favor of PLN, awarding them damages and issuing declaratory and permanent injunctive relief.

The plaintiff alleged that in being shackled in accordance with the Milwaukee County Jail’s (MCJ) policy, her Fourteenth Amendment right to due process had been violated.  

The case was originally assigned to Magistrate Judge David E. Jones. Due to non-consent to jurisdiction on the part of the plaintiff, however, the case was reassigned to Judge Lynn Adelman. On April 11, 2017, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint that contained minor rewordings of the factual allegations without significantly altering the claims for relief.

On October 17, 2017, the plaintiff filed a motion to certify class. The proposed class definition included “All persons who, while incarcerated by Milwaukee County Jail, were hospitalized for labor, delivery, or to receive post-partum treatment at any time from February 1, 2010-present.” This definition differed from the one originally proposed in the complaint in that it did not include “prenatal” care. Judge Adelman denied this motion on May 23, 2018. 

Litigation continued after the order denying class certification until April 8, 2019, when the parties informed the court that they had reached a private settlement agreement.

The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the law firm Loevy & Loevy, argued that the use of restraints during labor, delivery, and post-partum care was unjustified and violated their right to be free from unnecessary restraints. The court was tasked with determining if the class could be certified, which required a two-step analysis to determine if the plaintiffs had met the four express requirements and a fifth implied requirement. The court weighed the detainees' interest in being free from restraints against the jail's justification for using them, such as preventing escapes and ensuring safety. However, the court ultimately found that there were no common questions of law or fact between the potential class members, and thus, denied the motion for class certification. The court suggested that any constitutional violations, if present, would have occurred when the sheriff applied shackles to inmates",0.455,0.3491,0.3951,0.1048,0.0803,0.0909,0.2085,0.16,0.1811
DR-CA-0054,"On January 15, 2015, the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center (CREEC), along with two individuals requiring wheelchairs for mobility, brought this class action against Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc., in the US District Court for the Northern District of California. Ashford operated 15 hotels in California and others throughout the United States. In October 2014, the two plaintiffs had separately asked if the Courtyard Oakland Airport hotel and the Embassy Suites Walnut Creek hotel provided wheelchair-accessible shuttle services. Both locations informed the plaintiffs that they did not. The plaintiffs alleged that Ashford violated the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and California's Unruh Civil Rights Act by failing to provide wheelchair accessible vehicles at its hotels. The plaintiffs requested declaratory relief and a permanent injunction requiring Ashford to comply with state statutes and the ADA. The plaintiffs filed for class certification of individuals who rely on wheelchairs or scooters for mobility and have been or would be denied full and equal enjoyment of Ashford's services because of the lack of accessible transportation services at Ashford's hotels. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Donna M. Ryu. 

On March 25, 2015, the plaintiffs filed to consolidate and/or relate this case to two other cases for pre-trial purposes, because the defendants were publicly traded real estate investment trusts that own and operate hotels in the U.S. and the plaintiff was similarly-situated and seeking class certification. The judge rejected the argument that these similarities warranted case consolidation, and denied this motion on May 6, 2015. 

On August 27, CREEC filed a stipulated dismissal of all claims, with prejudice, of one of the plaintiffs. In an amended complaint filed on August 31, that plaintiff was removed and a new one was added.

Meanwhile the court had granted the defendant's request for private alternative dispute resolution and the parties began settlement discussions before Magistrate Judge James Larson. These proceedings concluded with a settlement agreement reached on October 2, 2015. On November 5, the plaintiffs filed an unopposed motion to certify the class and for preliminary approval of the settlement. The judge granted both motions on December 18, 2015. 

The Settlement Agreement required all Ashford-owned and operated hotels to come into compliance with ADA regulations by providing hotels that offer transportation services with equivalent transportation services for people who used wheelchairs or scooters. The Agreement explicitly required that Ashford provide accurate information to potential hotel guests so that no guests would be erroneously deterred. Ashford agreed to pay fees and costs of monitoring and the agreement authorized class counsel to seek an award of attorney's fees. 

The proposed Settlement Agreement was sent to hundreds of disability organizations as well as individuals who had communicated with CREEC about problems with Ashford's transportation. The plaintiffs sent class notice by email to 655 organizations and 43 individuals on December 21, 2015, and received no objections to the proposed settlement. 

On March 22, 2016, the court approved the final certification of the settlement class. In a final judgment on March 29, 2016, the Court approved the Settlement and announced that it would retain continuing jurisdiction over the parties, the lawsuit, and the settlement for purposes of enforcing the settlement and resolving disputes under the Settlement Agreement. The case was closed.","

This case, 4:15-cv-216, was initially filed in 2015 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiffs, represented by the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center (CREEC), included Ann Cupolo, Julie Reiskin, Linda Lam, and Joshua Davidson. The defendant, Ashford Hospitality Trust, Inc., is a publicly-traded real estate investment trust that owns and operates hotels, including the Courtyard Oakland Airport and Embassy Suites Walnut Creek in California. The plaintiffs alleged that Ashford had failed to provide equal access to transportation services for individuals with mobility disabilities at their hotels, in violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and California state laws. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief to ensure compliance with these laws. The attorneys involved in the case included Julia Campins and Hillary Benham-Baker from Campins Benham-Baker, LLP, and Sarah M. Morris from the Civil Rights Education and Enforcement Center for the plaintiffs, and Nolan S. Armstrong from Lewis Brisbois Bisgaard & Smith LLP for the defendant.

In December 2015, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion for class certification and preliminary approval of a class action settlement. The settlement included non-monetary relief such as training",0.736,0.2632,0.3877,0.3673,0.1309,0.193,0.3604,0.1289,0.1898
PC-NJ-0026,"This is a case about the unfair business practices of Global Tel*Link, a private company with a state granted monopoly on telephone services in New Jersey's prison systems. On August 20, 2013 the plaintiffs, people incarcerated in New Jersey prisons and people who created accounts with Global Tel*Link to receive calls from New Jersey prisoners, filed this class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey, where it was assigned to United States District Judge William J. Martini. The plaintiffs sued Global Tel*Link and several associated companies, alleging violations of New Jersey's Consumer Fraud and Public Utilities statutes, the Federal Communications Act (42 U.S.C. § 201), the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, and the Declaratory Judgment Act (28 U.S.C. § 2201). They plaintiffs also brought a common law unjust enrichment claim. In their § 1983 count, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants, acting on behalf of the State of New Jersey, imposed unconscionable fees and rates on plaintiffs, which amounted to a  violation of the Fifth Amendment's prohibition on the taking of property without just compensation. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiffs sought compensatory damages, disgorgment, restitution, and prejudgment interest, as well as injunctive relief and attorneys' fees. Specifically, they claimed that the defendant's billing policies were ""abusive, discriminatory, and unreasonable."" 

In 2006, Global Tel*Link, an Alabama company that provides telecommunications services and surveillance technology to correctional institutions, bought the contractual right to be the sole provider of telecommunications for prisons and many county jails in New Jersey. The plaintiffs in this case alleged that Global Tel*Link abused its monopoly power by charging plaintiffs exorbitant rates, forcing friends and family of incarcerated people to create prepaid accounts with minimum payments of $25 to receive calls from their loved ones, forfeiting money from prepaid accounts when they went unused for 90 days, and failing to disclose rates, fees, and billing practices. The defendants paid commissions, sometimes exceeding 50% of their revenue, to the correctional agency they contracted with. To turn a profit the defendants charged exceedingly high rates for calls and imposed numerous fees, such a 19% fee on deposits to the prepaid accounts.

On November 22, 2013, the defendants moved to dismiss the case, arguing that it should have been brought as a complaint to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) instead. At that time, the FCC had been in the process of determining whether the defendants' business practices were violations of the Federal Communications Act, as alleged in this lawsuit. On September 8, 2014, the court issued an opinion denying the motion to dismiss, but staying the case until the conclusion of the FCC's proceedings. The plaintiffs responded on September 19, 2014 by withdrawing their Federal Communications Act claim, as well as their claim under New Jersey Public Utilities Statutes.

After close to a year of discovery disputes, on August 7, 2015, the defendants moved to compel arbitration based on arbitration clauses in their products' terms of use. On February 11, 2016, Judge Martini denied the motion with respect to all but one of the plaintiffs. He found that the recorded message notifying Global Tel*Link users of its terms of use, including the arbitration provision, did not inform most of the plaintiffs that they would have to abide by Global Tel*link's terms of use to use its services. Consequently, the court held the plaintiffs did not enter into a legally enforceable contract with the defendants. One of the named plaintiffs who created their account through the defendants' website, which used a different system, was forced to arbitrate their claim. 

On June 15, 2016, the defendants filed a motion with the Judicial Panel for Multidistrict Litigation to consolidate this case with several others on which prisoners and their families were suing Global Tel*Link. The Panel denied that request in an October 13, 2015 order, docketed as JPML No. 2651, Entry 23.

The defendants appealed Judge Martini's arbitration decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit on March 9, 2016. On March 29, 2017, the Third Circuit affirmed Judge Martini's ruling in an opinion by Judge Thomas M. Hardiman. James v. Global Tel*Link Corp. 852 F.3d 262 (3d Cir. 2017). The Circuit agreed with Judge Martini that because the plaintiffs did not receive the defendants' terms of use or were informed that use of the defendants' services constituted assent to the terms, the plaintiffs were not bound by them or the arbitration clause they contained. 

While the appeal was pending, the case lay mostly dormant in the district court. The litigation continued to move slowly until the plaintiffs moved for class certification on their New Jersey Consumer Fraud Act and § 1983 Fifth Amendment Takings Clause claims on February 27, 2018. On August 6, 2018, Judge Martini granted that motion and certified a class consisting of all people incarcerated in New Jersey prisons or correctional institutions who used a phone system provided by the defendants and people who received calls from a person incarcerated in New Jersey or established an advance pay account to receive calls from such a person from 2006 to June 2011 (with the exception of people calling from or to Essex County).

On March 27, 2018 the defendants moved for summary judgment and on May 4, the plaintiffs filed a cross-motion on their § 1983 Takings claim. Judge Martini denied both motions on August 6 in a separate opinion from the one addressing the class certification question.The court rejected several of the defendants' legal claims, including the assertion that they were not state actors amenable to suit under § 1983 and finding issues of material fact for others. 

On April 2, 2018, Judge Martini referred the case to mediation and took the step of scheduling a settlement conference on December 10, 2019. However, the parties were unable to reach an agreement and the case was scheduled for trial in March of 2020.

On January 24, 2020, the defendants moved for judgment on the pleadings and to decertify the plaintiffs' class. Judge Martini granted the defendants' motion and dismissed plaintiffs' Fifth Amendments Takings claims on March 2, 2020. He found that denying the plaintiffs reasonably priced calling options did not amount to a taking as it lacked legal compulsion. The court did not resolve the decertification motion.

This case was scheduled to go to trial on March 16, 2020. However, in a March 3 settlement conference the parties reached an agreement on the broad terms of a settlement and the trial was canceled. After more negotiation, the plaintiffs moved for preliminary approval of a proposed settlement on May 28, 2020, which Judge Martini granted on July 15, 2020.

The settlement provided that the defendants would pay $25 million to a settlement fund. That money would be distributed to members of the plaintiffs' class based on the amount each member spent on the defendants' services, with a maximum recovery of $5,000 per account. While the class certified by the court included people who used the defendants' services in New Jersey after 2006, the settlement only allowed for payment to class members who used the defendants' services from 2006 to 2016. The settlement also allowed the plaintiffs to apply for a maximum of $8,332,500 in attorneys' fees. It also provided that class members who were still incarcerated in New Jersey would receive their payments in the form of credits on the phone accounts without filing a proof of claim. However, the settlement did not enjoin the defendants from continuing to engage in unfair business practices, as the plaintiffs had requested in their complaint.

After the proposed settlement was filed, on September 21, 2020, several plaintiffs from a separate class action against the defendants in the Northern District of Georgia moved to intervene in this case. The plaintiffs in the Georgia case also challenged some of the defendants' business practices, but on behalf of a putative class of individuals across the country who used the defendants' services. On October 22, 2020, Judge Martini denied this motion, finding that the Georgia plaintiffs did not have a sufficient direct interest in this case to intervene, but allowing them to appear as amicus curiae at the fairness hearing.

That hearing happened on October 15, 2020 and a week on October 22, 2020 later Judge Martini issued an opinion approving the settlement. He found that the settlement met all the relevant tests for approval and that he could not address the Georgia plaintiffs' concerns about the settlement, as their class had not yet been certified.

The case was closed the day of the order approving the settlement, though the settlement provides that the court will retain jurisdiction over the settlement and its enforcement. The is case ongoing as of November 2020 for settlement enforcement purposes. ","

This document is a compilation of individual summaries from various segments of a legal case titled James et al. v. Global Tel*Link Corp. et al. The plaintiffs in this case are a class of individuals who were incarcerated in New Jersey between 2006 and 2016 and used Global Tel*Link's inmate calling services. They allege that the defendant, Global Tel*Link and its subsidiaries, engaged in deceptive practices for profit and monopolized the market for inmate calling services in New Jersey. The plaintiffs seek relief under the Sherman Act and state law, including damages and an injunction against GTL's alleged unlawful practices. The attorneys involved in the case include Class Counsel and the Proposed Intervenors, who represent a separate class of plaintiffs with potential overlapping claims. The case has been ongoing for seven years and has involved multiple court proceedings, including mediation and settlement negotiations. The parties have reached a settlement agreement, which has been preliminarily approved by the court. However, the Proposed Intervenors have filed a motion to intervene or serve as amicus curiae in the case, claiming that their interests and the interests of their class are not adequately represented in the settlement.

EE-FL-0048,"On September 27, 2002, the Miami office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed a lawsuit under Title VII against Federal Express Corporation in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida.  The EEOC alleged that the defendant had violated the complainant's rights by constructively discharging him in retaliation for complaints of racial discrimination that he made on behalf of two interviewees.  On October 10, 2002, the complainant intervened in the case as a plaintiff, alleging that he was entitled to punitive damages under the Florida Whistleblower Act.

On April 13, 2004, Federal Express asked the court for summary judgment, but the district court denied that motion on October 13, 2004.  After several failed attempts to settle through mediation, the case went to trial on December 13, 2004.  After four days at trial, the jury issued a verdict in favor of the plaintiffs, awarding the complainant $201,010.30 in lost wages and $1.37 million in compensatory damages for emotional pain and mental anguish.  The defendants asked the court to reverse the verdict by issuing judgment as a matter of law in their favor, or, in the alternative, to grant them a new trial.  The court denied these motions, but it did grant their further motion to reduce the compensatory damage award to $350,000.  The plaintiff was given his choice of either accepting this reduced amount or going to a new trial on the compensatory damage award.  

A second jury trial was held on the issue of punitive damages on December 22, 2004.  On the same day, the jury found that the plaintiff was not entitled to punitive damages.  The complainant reached a later settlement with the defendant regarding his fees and costs.

Meanwhile, the district court issued another order on May 5, 2005, denying the plaintiff's request for front pay, but issuing an injunction against the defendants that required them to redistribute their anti-discrimination policy to all management officials with supervisory authority over employees at its Maitland, Florida location.  After this decision was issued, the plaintiff decided to accept the reduced compensatory damages award.

The defendants appealed all of these judgments to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit, asking the Eleventh Circuit to grant them judgment as a matter of law.  The plaintiff cross-appealed, asked the Eleventh Circuit to award him front pay.  On May 11, 2006, the Eleventh Circuit found that the district court's decisions had no reversible error, and they held that the lower court's rulings would stand.  E.E.O.C. v.

The document in question is a compilation of summaries from various segments of a court case involving Ted Maines and Federal Express Corporation. Maines, a senior manager and former employee of FedEx, filed a complaint against the company in 2002, alleging discrimination and retaliation based on his efforts to promote diversity within the company. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) joined as a plaintiff in the case, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The specific allegations made by Maines included being demoted and given a disciplinary warning letter after attempting to promote minority employees to supervisory positions. The EEOC sought injunctive relief against FedEx, along with Maines, who also sought compensatory and punitive damages. The attorneys involved in the case included representatives from the EEOC and lawyers from Jackson Lewis LLP representing FedEx. The case went through various motions and orders, including requests for extensions of time and motions for attorney fees. A jury ultimately found in favor of Maines, awarding him $201,000 in back pay and $1,370,000 in compensatory damages.

PN-CA-0030,"On October 28, 2008, an African-American man filed this class-action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Oakland, California Police Department and one of its officers. The suit was filed in U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel, requested injunctive relief and monetary damages, alleging that the City unlawfully targeted citizens on the basis of race, violating the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

Specifically, the plaintiff claimed that officers of the police department had issued warrants based on intentionally false or misleading information, subjecting him to unreasonable search and seizure, arresting him without probable cause, and maliciously prosecuting him.  On October 6, 2008, the charges against the plaintiff were dismissed when the Alameda County District Attorney's Office discovered that the warrant had been illegally obtained. Although the charges were dismissed, the plaintiff alleged that as a result of the unreasonable search and seizure, he was unable to work causing a loss of income and suffered damages for pain and emotional distress. 

On February 9, 2009, a second amended complaint was filed. This complaint added plaintiffs, including African American and Hispanic men and women, who were allegedly subjected to unreasonable search and seizure stemming from illegally obtained warrants and many of whom had been subsequently arrested.  

On August 5, 2010, the plaintiffs submitted a stipulated motion for approval of settlement. The United States District Court Northern District of California (Judge Thelton E. Henderson) granted the motion where the City offered to settle the monetary relief claims of the 104 individual plaintiffs and putative class members for total gross settlement sum of $6,500.00 inclusive of all attorney fees and costs. After reaching this agreement, the parties continued with settlement discussions on non-monetary relief claims. Their discussions focused on specific reforms intended to remedy the kind of police misconduct that occurred in this case that would be of substantial benefit to the putative class. 

On February 14, 2011, the parties reached a non-monetary settlement agreement. The settlement set out specific procedures for the Oakland Police Department to obtain affidavits and warrants. The parties also agreed to set of protocols for drug evidence testing. The Court retained jurisdiction for two years from the settlement date so that the parties could petition for redress pertaining to compliance with their agreement. 

There is nothing substantive in the docket sheet following settlement.  Presumably the matter is closed.  ","

IM-GA-0014,"COVID-19 Summary: Over a dozen non-citizens detained in immigration detention facilities, who had underlying medical conditions rendering them particularly susceptible to COVID-19 complications, filed this suit on April 3, 2020 against U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement in Atlanta, GA, seeking immediate release. The court granted a motion to dismiss and terminated the case on April 7, 2020. <hr>

On April 3, 2020, the Southern Poverty Law Center, Asian Americans Advancing Justice, and private counsel filed suit on behalf of thirteen individuals detained in three U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) detention or processing centers in Georgia. The plaintiffs named as defendants ICE, the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, and various officers of those departments. The plaintiffs asked the court to issue a writ of habeas corpus, or in the alternative, issue injunctive relief ordering the immediate release of the plaintiffs. In addition, the plaintiffs sought a declaration stating that the continued detention of individuals at increased risk for severe illness including COVID-19, violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Further, the plaintiffs asked for an award of attorneys' fees. 

The complaint alleged that the medical conditions or underlying diseases of these detained individuals, like diabetes and hypertension, made them particularly vulnerable to COVID-19. The facilities where ICE has detained the plaintiffs lacked access to critical care necessary for treating serious cases of COVID-19.

According to the complaint, imprisoned populations, including those in ICE detention facilities, pose a higher risk for the spread of infectious disease. The plaintiffs stated that in March 2020, over 3,000 medical professionals across the United States urged ICE to release individuals and families to prevent the spread of COVID-19 among detainees as well as facility staff. The complaint also explained that social distancing measures and large-scale quarantines as recommended by the Center for Disease Control are ""nearly impossible"" in immigration detention due to overcrowding, poor availability of hygiene products, and lack of access to adequate medical services.

In addition to the complaint, plaintiffs filed a motion for a temporary restraining order as well as an emergency writ of habeas corpus and requested an immediate hearing given the time-sensitive nature of the case. The plaintiffs alleged that because the government knew or should have known of the substantial risk to the plaintiffs, the continued detention of these individuals demonstrated deliberate indifference, thereby violating the plaintiffs' right to Due Process under the Fifth Amendment.

On April 6, 2020 the defendants filed a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction or in the alternative, a transfer of venue. Additionally, the defendants asked the court to sever the plaintiffs' claims by facility.

The plaintiffs, in response, filed a motion for voluntary dismissal on April 6, 2020. The motion, without conceding that this court lacked jurisdiction, gave notice of the dismissal in the interest of expediting emergency relief. The motion stated that the plaintiffs would seek relief in other federal district courts. <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=17609""> <i>Martinez v.

They argue that their continued detention violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment and request immediate release or injunctive relief. The respondents, the government and ICE officials, are accused of acting with deliberate indifference towards the health and safety of the petitioners and failing to provide adequate medical care and protection from COVID-19. The petitioners provide evidence, through various exhibits and sources, that ICE has consistently failed to adequately protect the medically vulnerable in its custody and that the conditions in the detention facilities constitute impermissible punishment.

JC-MD-0007,"On May 12, 2005, male arrestees at the Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center filed this lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Maryland. The plaintiffs sued the warden of Central Booking, the Baltimore Police Department, the City of Baltimore, and other state officials under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the Court for injunctive relief, compensatory and consequential damages, and attorneys fees and costs. The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants had violated their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights when they engaged in unconstitutional strip searches of the plaintiffs and detained the plaintiffs for unreasonable lengths of time. This case was one of three cases alleging mistreatment of persons arrested and taken to Central Booking for booking and processing. The other cases were JC-MD-0008: Maryland NAACP v. Baltimore City Police Department, 1:06-cv-01863-CCB (D. Md. 2006) and JC-MD-0011: Rodney v. Murphy, 24-C-05004405, filed in Maryland state court. 

Plaintiffs sought certification for five classes. First, the suspicionless strip search class which consisted of those who had been or would be arrested for crimes not involving weapons, drugs, or felony violence, who were strip searched by Central Booking employees without any individualized finding that they were harboring weapons, drugs, or other contraband. Second, the non-private strip search class was composed of those who had been or would be subjected to strip searches at Central Booking with other arrestees present. Third, the equal protection strip search class consisted of male arrestees strip searched at Central Booking while similarly-situated female arrestees were not. Fourth, the underwear strip search class was made up of male arrestees subjected to an underwear strip search while similarly-situated female arrestees were not. Fifth, the over-detention class consisted of those arrested without warrants who had been or would be detained for an unreasonable length of time (more than 48 hours) before presentment to a judicial officer for a determination of probable cause. 

The defendants moved to dismiss the third amended complaint for failure to state a claim. The District Court (District Judge Catherine C. Blake) granted the motion in part and dismissed all claims against the City and the Police Department, rejecting the theory of ""entrustment liability.""  Claims against the state defendants survived, with the exception of individual claims against the current warden. 470 F.Supp.2d 537 (D. Md. Jan 04, 2007). 

On July 11, 2008, the district court (Judge Blake) issued a memorandum on the issue of whether the gender-differentiated search policy violated the Equal Protection Clause.  The court granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary judgment on the issue and denied the defendants' motion.

On March 19, 2009, the district court partially granted the plaintiffs' motion to certify a class.  Specifically, the court certified the following subclasses: 1) those people detained for more than 48 hours without having been brought before a commissioner, and 2) those people arrested for minor, nondrug, nonviolent offenses and strip-searched before they were brought before a commissioner. The court declined to certify the following subclasses: 1) those people who weren't strip-searched privately, and 2) male arrestees who were searched to their underwear when female detainees were not.

For the next two years, discovery motions were exchanged, until the defendants filed a motion for partial summary judgment on January 14, 2011. 

On March 5th, 2013 Judge Blake issued a memorandum and an order granting the motion for partial summary judgment. The court granted the motion under the doctrine of qualified immunity. 

The plaintiffs filed an appeal on August of 2013.  A panel of three judges rendered a decision on November 11, 2014. 771 F.3d 209 (4th Cir. 2014). The Circuit Court (Circuit Judge James Harvie Wilkinson III) affirmed the district court's decision to grant partial summary judgment for the defendants. The court noted that several police officers and guards testified that they found illegal contraband from these searches. And the searchers were being conducted in a private room. On the issue of qualified immunity, the court noted that the right to not be subjected to a strip search was not clearly established at the time of the searches. A Supreme Court decision was filed in 2012, settling aspects of the issue after the fact, but before this, officers who were conducting searches, could not reasonably tell if the searches were violating a constitutional right. The court found the defense of qualified immunity acceptable here, and determined that the motion for partial summary judgment was properly granted. 

Circuit Judge James Andrew Wynn Jr. filed a concurring opinion in which he pointed out that the Supreme Court intimated in the <i>Florence</i> decision that there may be exceptions to the rule. That detainees not being admitted into the general population should not have to be stripped searched. The complexities of the exceptions had not been explored by the courts, and Judge Wynn noted that there needed to be more elaboration on this topic, so public officials would know how to act accordingly. However, the merits of the case were not be reached because of the granting of summary judgment. 

On February 24, 2015 Judge Blake filed a memo regarding the January 31, 2011 motion for partial summary judgment. 2015 WL 790334. The motion was made by the warden-defendant, over the class of Plaintiffs claiming that Central Booking practiced ""over-detention.""  The court held that the plaintiffs' theory of supervisor liability was defective because there was no evidence that the warden-defendant was deliberately indifferent to the constitutional injury of the Plaintiffs. The warden-defendant did not deny that there were detainees held longer than 48 hours, which was past what was constitutionally acceptable, but she argued that it was caused by factors outside of her control. The court agreed that the delays in presenting detainees before a court commissioner was the fault of the Baltimore police, the state's attorneys office, and court officials. Furthermore, the court argued that the warden had made several efforts to remedy the problem, and that the plaintiffs' complaint that it was not fast enough or proactive enough did not prove deliberate indifference. Finally, the court also granted the summary judgment motion on the theory of qualified immunity, so the defendant had no fair warning that her conduct was unconstitutional. 

A few months later on June 15, 2015 the Court entered final judgment and closed the case.

The plaintiffs, Kevin Adams, Anthony Haig, Gary Saunders, Michael Washington, and Dana T. West, are represented by their attorney, Sean Day, and allege that the defendant, Susan Murphy, a former Baltimore City Police Department officer, violated their civil rights by falsely arresting and maliciously prosecuting them. The plaintiffs seek monetary damages for emotional distress and violation of their constitutional rights, and are represented by William Brockman, the defendant's attorney. 

The dispute between the parties began in 2011 and lasted until 2017, with multiple motions, responses, and court orders being filed. In March 2013, Judge Catherine C. Blake granted the plaintiffs' motion for partial summary judgment, which was followed by the defendant's motion for entry of judgment under Rule",0.619,0.0966,0.1671,0.2575,0.04,0.0692,0.3869,0.0604,0.1044
DR-DC-0007,"On August 14, 2018, two children with mental health disabilities in the District of Columbia and University Legal Services, Inc. filed this lawsuit on behalf of themselves and a class of children with mental health disabilities, in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the District of Columbia under:<ul><li>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§ 12111 <i>et seq.</i>;</li><li>Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794;</li><li>The Protection and Advocacy of Individual Rights program, 29 U.S.C. § 794;</li><li>Title XIX of the Social Security Act (Medicaid Act), 42 U.S.C. § 1396; and</li><li>42 U.S.C. § 1983.</li></ul>The plaintiffs, represented by the National Center for Youth Law, the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law, in-house counsel, and private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief together with costs and attorney’s fees. The plaintiffs claimed that the District of Columbia failed to comply with mandates of the ADA, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, and the Medicaid Act. Specifically, they claimed that the District of Columbia failed to provide medically necessary intensive community-based services (ICBS) to children with mental health disabilities.

Intensive community-based services consist of three components:
<ol><li><i>Intensive care coordination</i> (ICC): designing and supervising a plan to provide and coordinate services to children that includes the child, the child’s family, and service providers;</li><li><i>Intensive behavior support services</i>: individual therapy provided to the child where they live; and</li><li><i>Mobile crisis services</i>: crisis response services that can provide care in a child’s home, school, or community.</li></ol>In their complaint, the plaintiffs acknowledged that the District of Columbia provides some components of ICBS. For example, the District offers the “high fidelity wraparound” ICC program, “community-based intervention” services, and the Assertive Community Treatment (ACT) intensive support program. But the plaintiffs alleged that the District’s existing services “fail[] to provide medically necessary ICBS” for many children who need them. 

The complaint did not name the putative class representatives. Instead, the plaintiffs moved that the minor plaintiffs be allowed to proceed anonymously. Chief Judge Beryl A. Howell granted this motion on August 14, 2018. Judge Howell determined that the plaintiffs have a “strong interest” in protecting “highly sensitive details” about their mental health that would be revealed in the litigation that outweighs the government defendants’ “minimal” interest in disclosure.  

The District moved to dismiss the case on October 3. First, it argued that the two individual plaintiffs lack standing. The District claimed that the first individual plaintiff refused to use the District’s existing wraparound services, that the second would not be eligible for ICBS because she is in the custody of the Department of Youth Rehabilitation Services, and that the complaint does not allege sufficient facts to support a claim by University Legal Services alone. Second, it argued that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because the plaintiffs’ allegations involve the adequacy of care rather than where the District provides services. Finally, the District argued that the plaintiffs’ allegations that it violated Medicaid requirements were “threadbare . . . conclusory statements” that could not support a claim under the pleading standard set in <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i>. 

On July 25, 2019, the court (now Judge Emmet G. Sullivan) denied the motion to dismiss holding that the individual plaintiffs had standing to bring the suit, had sufficiently stated a claim under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and had sufficiently alleged a § 1983 claim. 401 F.Supp.3d 1.

As of July 2020, discovery is ongoing.

District of Columbia, et al., filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. The plaintiffs, M.J., L.R., and University Legal Services, Inc., are represented by attorneys from the Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law and the National Health Law Program. The defendants are the District of Columbia, its mayor, and directors of healthcare and behavioral health agencies. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants have violated federal law by failing to provide necessary Intensive Community Based Services (ICBS) to Medicaid-eligible children with mental health disabilities, resulting in a risk of institutionalization. The plaintiffs have requested information through Interrogatories 1 and 2 from putative class members, which the defendants have opposed, citing privacy concerns. After careful consideration, the court has granted and denied parts of the motion, allowing the plaintiffs to proceed with obtaining information decoupled from unique identification numbers. The plaintiffs' attorneys argue that this information is crucial in proving their case, while also emphasizing the importance of protecting the privacy of putative members.

This document, titled ""Motion for Protective Order in Case of Current and Former Employees of Wayne Farms LLC vs. Wayne Farms LLC,"" outlines a lawsuit filed by multiple plaintiffs against the defendant, Wayne Farms LLC, for alleged violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). The plaintiffs, including Paul Naylor, Michael Rice, and Barbara D Baker, are seeking relief for unpaid wages and overtime, as well as other damages and attorney's fees. The defendant has expressed concerns about the production of payroll information and has requested a protective order for all confidential information and documents. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys Roman A Shaul and Robert Camp, while the defendant is represented by attorney Lisa Sharp. The court proceedings involved various motions, including a motion to stay proceedings and a motion to apply the first-filed rule, which were partially granted and denied by Judge R David Proctor. The case also involved a motion for a hearing and a motion to certify a class, which were both ultimately heard and ruled on by Judge Inge P Johnson. The plaintiffs allege that Wayne Farms LLC engaged in discriminatory practices against older employees in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and are seeking injunctive relief and damages.

PB-FL-0015,"On February 28, 2014, a same-sex couple married outside of the state of Florida filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Florida against the state of Florida. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sought injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. 1983, declaratory judgment, and costs. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed the state ban against same-sex marriage violated their rights under the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, the First Amendment (right to associate), and violated the Supremacy Clause and the Establishment Clause. This case was captioned as <i>Brenner v. Scott</i>. 

On March 12, 2014, several same-sex couples married outside of the state of Florida, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, filed essentially an identical lawsuit, also in the Northern District of Florida. This case was captioned as <i>Grimsley v. Scott</i>. On April 21, 2014, the Court (Judge Robert L. Hinkle), upon a joint motion, consolidated the two cases for case management purposes. Both cases are addressed in this summary and Clearinghouse case record.

On April 24, 2014, Judge Hinkle denied permission to Florida Family Action, a ""cultural action organization"" that opposes same-sex marriage, to intervene as a party. FFA was permitted, however, to file amicus briefs. 298 F.R.D. 689 (N.D. Fla. 2014). 

On August 21, 2014, Judge Hinkle issued a preliminary injunction, finding Florida's ban on same-sex marriage a violation of plaintiffs' fundamental right to marry under the Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses (using strict scrutiny in the analysis). The court stayed the preliminary injunction in these cases until ninety-one days after similar stays were denied or lifted in three cases pending in the Fourth and Tenth Circuit Courts—<i>Bostic v. Schaefer</i>, 2014 WL 3702493 (4th Cir. July 28, 2014); <i>Bishop v. Smith</i>, 2014 WL 3537847 (10th Cir. July 18, 2014); and <i>Kitchen v. Herbert</i>, 2014 WL 2868044 (10th Cir. June 25, 2014). Brenner v. Scott, -- F.Supp.2d --, 2014 WL 4113100 (N.D. Fla. 2014). 

On June 26, 2015, the Supreme Court of the United States held, in <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12787"">Obergefell v. Hodges</a>, that the right to marry was fundamental. In the opinion written by Justice Kennedy, the Court held that it demeans gay and lesbian couples to deprive them of access to marriage. The Fourteenth Amendment thus did not allow states to ban same-sex marriage. Kennedy was joined without further writing by Justices Ginsburg, Breyer, Kagan, and Sotomayor. Each of the four dissenters—Chief Justice Roberts, and Justices Scalia, Thomas, and Alito—wrote a dissent. 

On August 4, 2015, the <i>Grimsley</i> plaintiffs moved for summary judgment. The defendants opposed, arguing that the court should not grant summary judgment but rather dismiss the case as moot.

Meanwhile, the defendants moved for voluntarily dismissal of the appeal at the Eleventh Circuit. On October 19, 2015, the Eleventh Circuit granted the voluntary dismissal transferred consideration of attorney's fees to the district court. On January 12, 2016, the issue of appellate's attorney's fees was also transferred to the district court for consideration. 

On March 2, 2016, the <i>Brenner</i> plaintiffs filed a separate motion for summary judgment. The plaintiffs asked that the court not dismiss this case as moot because the same-sex marriage ban was not repealed and Florida's Surgeon General persisted in refusing to issue birth certificates to the children of same-sex couples. On March 30, 2016, Judge Hinkle granted the plaintiffs summary judgment and declared the Florida Constitution, Article I, § 27 as well as Florida Statutes § 741.212 and  §741.04(1) as unconstitutional. Judge Hinkle also issued an injunction to prohibit the defendants from enforcing or applying the Florida provisions that were declared unconstitutional. The court granted and denied in part the defendant’s motion to dismiss as moot; it dismissed the claims against the Clerk of Court as moot but not the claims against the Surgeon General and Secretary. Subsequently, the court entered judgment for the plaintiffs against the Secretary of the Department of Management Services and the Surgeon General, but the court dismissed without prejudice the claims against all other defendants. 

On April 13, 2016, the plaintiffs filed a motion for entitlement to attorneys’ fees and costs, which the court granted and determined that the plaintiffs were entitled to a fee award. The parties, however, then filed a joint notice of settlement on attorney’s fees and costs. (The amount that the parties settled on is not publicly available.) On June 16, 2016, the plaintiffs officially withdrew their fee petition and notified the court that they received their settlement funds.

This case, titled ""Moot,"" involves a series of legal motions and actions from September 2015 to June 2016.

The defendants in this case, including the Brenner Plaintiffs, have reached a settlement on attorney fees and costs. The plaintiffs sought attorney fees and costs due to their successful challenge against Florida's ban on same-sex marriage, arguing that they were entitled to relief under the Civil Rights Act.

Complainants allege that their positions as Sales Consultants were terminated, by the defendant, despite their records of high performance. Additionally, complainants allege that the defendant hired younger and less experienced representatives to take their place.

Following extensive discovery and a series of failed motions for partial summary judgment by the defendant, the parties settlted the lawsuit in July 2006 through a consent decree.

The one-year decree, containing an anti-retaliaton clause, required the defendant to: make biannual compliance reports, keep records of compliance, provide complainants with references, post notice of employee rights, provide a training seminar regarding the ADEA to Phoenix employees, and pay $425,000 to be distributed among five individuals.

The decree was entered in July 2006 and scheduled to last until July 2007. No further docket entries exist, so the case is closed.

This document is a court judgment issued in a case brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Lennar Homes of Arizona Inc. The plaintiffs in this case, represented by the EEOC, alleged that Lennar had engaged in discriminatory practices against older employees in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act. The plaintiffs, including Gregory Leach and Carol Nikrant, sought damages and injunctive relief to address the alleged discrimination. The case was overseen by Judge David G. Campbell, with attorneys Robert N. Sewell Jr. representing the defendant and Michelle Marshall representing the EEOC.

The case began in 2003 and involved multiple motions and responses from both parties. In 2006, a pretrial conference was held and a trial date was set for July 14, with a settlement conference scheduled prior to the trial. However, a settlement was not reached and the trial proceeded with a jury. Prior to the trial, the EEOC filed motions to exclude certain evidence and testimony, including testimony from a defense expert witness. The trial concluded with a verdict in favor of the EEOC, and the court issued a consent judgment on July 14, 2006, ordering Lennar to pay back pay,",0.3776,0.4134,0.3947,0.1128,0.1236,0.118,0.2245,0.2458,0.2347
JC-IL-0006,"On May 8, 2003, an individual mistakenly arrested on an erroneous warrant filed a 42 U.S.C. § 1983 lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, alleging that his Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated by the Sheriff of Will County in that he had been unlawfully detained at the Will County Jail after being ordered released by a judge.  On August 8, 2003, an amended complaint was filed, adding a second named plaintiff and adding Will County, Illinois as a defendant.  The amended complaint also added allegations challenging the Jail's shackling and strip search policies and seeking class certification.  Specifically, Plaintiffs alleged that the Sheriff's ""strip search/ shackling"" policy deprived them of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights and sought certification of two subclasses: (1) all persons who were handcuffed, shackled, and strip searched at the Will County Jail after being ordered to be immediately released by a judge; and (2) all individuals who were held at the Will County Jail on a recalled or already executed warrant issued after they complained that they were being wrongfully held in custody.  Plaintiffs sought class certification, declaratory judgment, compensatory damages, and costs.  A second amended complaint adding a third named plaintiff was filed on February 12, 2004.

On May 12, 2004, the District Court (Judge Robert W. Gettleman) certified the case as a class action, establishing two subclasses: (1) all individuals who, between May 8, 2001 and the date of the judgment, were arrested for failure to appear in a misdemeanor or traffic case and, who, upon arrival at the Will County Jail, were strip searched without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion or probable cause that he or she was concealing contraband or weapons (the ""post-arrest strip search"" subclass); and (2) all traffic or misdemeanor arrestees who, between May 8, 2001 and the date of the judgment, became entitled to release from the Will County Jail, and who, while being processed out of the Sheriff's custody, were strip searched without any individualized finding of reasonable suspicion that he or she was concealing contraband or weapons (the ""post-release strip search"" subclass).  The court refused to certify a third subclass consisting of those arrested on ""bad warrants"" because it found that the numerosity requirement had not been met.  Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 2004 WL 1125922, 2004 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 8717 (N.D.Ill. May 12, 2004). 

Plaintiffs subsequently moved for summary judgment.  On December 16, 2005, the District Court (Judge Gettleman) granted the Plaintiffs' motion, holding that both (1) the blanket policy of strip searching persons arrested for failure to appear in misdemeanor or traffic cases, and (2) the blanket policy of strip searching persons who were returned to jail for processing after being ordered released on traffic or misdemeanor charges violated Fourth Amendment.  Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 405 F.Supp.2d 933 (N.D.Ill. Dec 16, 2005).  On April 14, 2006, the Court, at the request of Defendants, amended its December 16 order to make it immediately appealable.  Calvin v. Sheriff of Will County, 2006 WL 1005141, 2006 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 27341 (N.D.Ill. Apr 14, 2006).  

While the case was on interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the parties settled the lawsuit.  Under the Settlement Agreement, Will County agreed to pay $2.15 million into a common fund to settle all claims for damages, expenses, and attorneys' fees.  Attorneys' fees and expenses were to be paid from the fund and were not to exceed 40% of the total payout.  Each of the three named plaintiffs was to receive $25,000 as an incentive payment.  The remainder of the fund would be used to pay class claims.  It was anticipated that each class member would receive about $700.

On September 20, 2006, the District Court (Judge Virginia M. Kendall) preliminarily approved the settlement.  After holding a November 17, 2006 fairness hearing, the Court issued a November 27, 2006 order finally approving the settlement.  Subsequent proceedings established the procedure for the final distribution of settlement funds.  No further proceedings are apparent from the docket.

This document is a comprehensive summary of a class action lawsuit (Case 1:03-cv-03086) filed against the Sheriff of Will County and Will County, Illinois by plaintiffs Javar Calvin, William Moore, and Charles Davis. The plaintiffs allege that they were unlawfully strip searched and shackled while in custody at the Will County Adult Detention Facility. They seek relief for themselves and a putative class of similarly situated individuals, citing violations of their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs are represented by attorney Kenneth N. Flaxman. The defendant, represented by Sergeant Brian Fink, denies any wrongdoing and argues that the strip search policies are necessary for institutional security. After several years of legal proceedings, including class certification, summary judgment, and appeals, a settlement was reached in April 2007 for $2.15 million.

CJ-MI-0008,"On April 14, 2019, several pre-trial detainees in Wayne County Jail filed this class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the 36th District Court in Detroit, the Wayne County Sheriff's Office (WCSO), the Chief Judge, and five Magistrates of the 26th District Court in their official capacities under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU and private counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming violations of the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses and the Sixth Amendment's Right to Counsel. The case was assigned to Judge Laurie J. Michelson. 

The plaintiffs alleged that the defendants unconstitutionally detained them in Wayne County Jail because they were unable to pay for their release and that the defendants' current arraignment policies created a wealth-based detention system that kept the plaintiffs in jail for their inability to afford bail. All of the plaintiffs included in the complaints were arrested and had their arraignment hearings held in the 36th District Court in Detroit. The plaintiffs were not provided attorneys during their arraignments and in each instance, the plaintiffs were ordered to pay cash bail amounts beyond their financial abilities. The arraignment policies provided two different condition forms: (1) 10% bail condition, which required the plaintiff to pay 10% or the real estate equivalent of their bail amount in order to be released; or (2) full cash bail condition, which required the plaintiff to pay the full amount. The magistrate judges that set the plaintiffs' bail amounts did not inquire whether the plaintiffs could afford their set bail amounts. When plaintiffs notified the court that they were unable to pay bail, they were sent to Wayne County Jail. 

The plaintiffs also sought class certification of all pre-trial detainees that had their bail set during arraignment hearings held in the 36th District Court and as a result of the court's bail policies were detained because they could not afford their imposed cash bail conditions. 

On June 10, 2019, WCSO moved to dismiss the complaint. They alleged that the plaintiffs could not seek injunctive relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 because: they were an entity entitled to quasi-judicial immunity where declaratory relief was available; under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the plaintiffs failed to state a claim for municipal liability because obeying court orders is not considered a policy of the municipality; and the plaintiffs failed to demonstrate that clearly established law would have put WCSO on notice that obeying a court order for pretrial incarceration would expose it to liability under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. 

On June 19, 2019, the Chief Judge moved to dismiss plaintiffs' class action complaint.

A stipulated stay order was entered on August 23, 2019 to allow time for discussions between the parties as to resolution of the matter. Meanwhile, the Detroit News <a href=https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/detroit-city/2020/04/01/former-detroit-magistrate-whistleblower-lawsuit/5103584002/>reported</a> that a former Detroit magistrate judge filed a federal whistleblower lawsuit alleging that she had been fired after raising concerns about violations of defendants' rights in the 36th District Court. 

As of April 12, 2021, the case remains stayed. However, the court has held telephone status conferences, and the case remains ongoing.

This document, titled ""Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief,"" is a class-action lawsuit filed against the 36th District Court in Michigan for its Arraignment Policies and Practices. The plaintiffs, Davontae Ross, Timothy Lucas, Starmanie Jackson, Kushawn Moore Jr., Asia Dixon, and Keith Wilson, are indigent arrestees who have been detained in the Wayne County Jails due to their inability to pay secured cash bail set by the Magistrate Defendants in the 36th District Court. They are represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union Fund of Michigan and the Criminal Law Reform Project, who argue that the court's policies violate the plaintiffs' constitutional rights, including their right to equal protection and due process. They also allege that the policies result in pretrial detention and coerce guilty pleas, violating their Sixth Amendment right to counsel. The plaintiffs seek relief in the form of a certified class, a declaratory judgment that the policies are unconstitutional, and a permanent injunction against the court from maintaining the policies.

PB-MO-0001,"This is a class action filed in the Western District of Missouri, in which the plaintiffs are seeking to prevent the state from disenrolling recipients in Missouri's State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP) who fail to meet their premium requirements without first notifying them of their right to appeal and to continue to receive program benefits pending the outcome of the appeal.  The defendants are the Missouri Department of Social Services, and the interim directors of the state Family Support Division and the state Division of Medical Services.  According to the named plaintiff, Julia M., Missouri terminated the benefits of her minor child, when, after a series of bank errors, the monthly premium was not deducted from Julia M.'s account in a timely fashion. Julie M. received the notice after the benefits already had been terminated. While the notice indicated a right to appeal, it did not indicate a right to continue benefits pending the outcome of the appeal or that the state had conducted any evaluation to determine eligibility for other benefits. 

On June 25, 2007, the District Court (Judge Nanette K. Laughrey) certified the class, defining it as ""[a]ll children residing in Missouri and who are receiving or who will receive [Missouri SCHIP] health coverage and are required to pay a premium under [state law]."" 

Judge Laughrey, however, did not immediately rule on the request of the representative plaintiff, identified as Julia M., to issue a preliminary injunction requiring the Missouri Department of Social Services to provide recipients with sufficient notice of disenrollment and continued benefits pending any appeal.

On February 2, 2008, the parties signed a Consent Decree in which the Defendants agreed to notify participants in SCHIP who have fallen behind in their payments. The notification must tell the participant that he/she has a right to appeal, and that during the appeals process he/she is entitled to continued benefits until the matter is resolved. Defendants also agreed to pay the plaintiffs over $165,000 in attorneys fees and expenses.   

The Court was to retain jurisdiction until October 15, 2008 in order to monitor the execution of the Consent Decree.

This document, titled ""Notice of Reinstatement of Coverage for MO HealthNet for Kids,"" serves as a notice to the recipient that their health care coverage through the MO HealthNet for Kids program has been reinstated after being discontinued for non-payment of premiums. The plaintiffs, represented by their attorneys, brought a class action lawsuit against the defendants, the Missouri Department of Social Services and other officials, alleging that the Department was not providing proper notice and opportunity for a hearing before terminating coverage for non-payment of premiums. The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of requiring the Department to send notices of pending termination and conduct reviews of eligibility before terminating benefits. The attorneys for both parties reached a settlement agreement, which was approved by the court, and the Department was ordered to provide proper notice and conduct reviews of eligibility before terminating coverage. The plaintiffs' attorneys monitored the ex parte review process and reported any non-compliance to the court. The court found the settlement to be fair and reasonable, and the defendants were ordered to pay the plaintiffs' attorney fees and expenses. The court retained jurisdiction for enforcement of the settlement agreement.

In its complaint, the EEOC alleged that the defendant subjected three female employees to sexual harassment and constructive discharge in violation of Title VII. In November 2000, two of the charging parties intervened in the suit.

The parties were involved in numerous discovery disputes and each filed a partial motion for summary judgment. The case remained open, however, and a jury trial was set for March 2002. The parties eventually resolved the case in March 2002 before going to trial by the entry of a consent decree. The defendant was required to pay $45,000.00 to resolve the litigation. It was also required to provide sexual harassment training to its management. Defendant Bakin' Bagels ceased its business operations on November 2001; therefore, the decree's provisions on training will be applicable if and when it reopens.

This document is a summary of a legal case, filed as 2:03-cv-898, involving the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and Mount Carmel, LLC. The case was filed on January 16, 2004, and had multiple court dates throughout the year. The plaintiff, Suzanne Whitty, was an employee of Mount Carmel, LLC and alleged that she was terminated in retaliation for speaking out against sexual harassment and participating in an investigation. The EEOC filed a complaint against Mount Carmel, LLC and Benedictine Health System, Inc. for violating Title VII of the Civil Rights Act and other laws. The parties reached a settlement through a Consent Decree, with Mount Carmel, LLC agreeing to pay Whitty $27,500 for lost income and $150,000 for other damages, as well as attorney fees. The court granted the EEOC's motion for summary judgment, finding that Mount Carmel, LLC had engaged in unlawful employment practices by retaliating against Whitty. The court also ordered Mount Carmel, LLC to provide training on Title VII and sexual harassment to its management employees and to post a public notice of its compliance with fair employment laws.

PA-NC-0004,"This is one of several federal lawsuits addressing North Carolina Session Law 2016-3, House Bill 2 (HB2), which was passed on March 23, 2016.  For the others, see the <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/results.php?saveRef=pl&search=source%7Cgeneral%3BspecialCollection%7C43%3Borderby%7CfilingYear%3B"">case collection.</a>

On February 22, 2016, the Charlotte City Council passed Ordinance 7056, which prohibited discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation or gender identity in public accommodations, passenger vehicle for hire, and city contractors. The city ordinance was set to take effect on April 1, 2016.

In response, on March 23, 2016, the North Carolina legislature held a special session and passed House Bill 2; it was signed that same day by North Carolina Governor Pat McCrory. HB2 prohibited municipalities in North Carolina from enacting anti-discrimination policies and removed the statutory and common-law private right of action to enforce state anti-discrimination statutes in state courts. It also required that individuals only be permitted to use bathrooms and changing facilities that correspond to the sex on their birth certificates while in government buildings.  For many transgender people, this prevented them from using the restroom consistent with their gender identity (in North Carolina, only people who undergo sex reassignment surgery can change the sex on their birth certificates; some other jurisdictions have even more restrictive rules).  In addition, the legislation changed the definition of sex in the state's anti-discrimination law to ""the physical condition of being male or female, which is stated on a person's birth certificate,” which prevented discrimination against transgender people from being classified as a type of sex discrimination. 

On May 4, in a letter to Governor Pat McCrory, the Justice Department informed him that the U.S. had concluded that HB2 violated federal law.  The DOJ <a href=""http://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/05/north-carolina-hb2/481347/"">asked</a> the Governor to respond by close of business on May 9, and that he remedy the violations, ""including by confirming that the State will not comply with or implement H.B. 2.""

Instead of providing the demanded assurances, the Governor sued the United States on the morning of May 9, in the Eastern District of North Carolina, seeking a declaratory judgment that HB2 did not violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq.), or the Violence Against Woman Act (42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)).  That case is in the Clearinghouse as <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15316"">PA-NC-0003</a>, and is described there. A few hours later, the U.S. filed this lawsuit, seeking to enjoin operation of HB2, in the U.S District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The DOJ sued the State of North Carolina under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act (42 U.S.C. §§ 2000e et seq.), under Title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972 (20 U.S.C. §§ 1681 et seq.), and under the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act (42 U.S.C. § 13925(b)(13)). The DOJ sought declaratory and injunctive relief. Specifically, the U.S. asked the Court to find that HB 2’s Part I—the part that instructs public agencies to deny transgender individuals access to multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities consistent with their gender identity--violated federal law, and to issue an injunction ordering the state to stop violating the federal laws in question.

North Carolina’s former Attorney General, Roy Cooper, had <a href="" http://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/politics-government/article68780957.html"">said</a> that he agreed that HB2 is illegal, and declined to defend it against this and the other lawsuits challenging it.

On June 10, 2016 the United States and the Defendants issued a joint motion to enjoin automatic suspension of funds received under the Violence Against Women Act that prohibits recipients of federal funds administered by the Department of Justice’s Office on Violence Against Women (“OVW”) from engaging in discrimination based on sex and gender identity. The United States and the Defendants agreed that the suspension of funds would on balance harm the public interest. On June 23, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder granted the parties' joint motion to enjoin the United States from automatically withholding funds. 192 F.Supp.3d 620. 

On June 29, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder granted Phil Berger, President Pro Tempore of the North Carolina Senate, and Tim Moore, Speaker of the North Carolina House of Representatives, the right to permissively intervene as defendants in the case. Several other private individuals requested to intervene on either side of the case and their motions were denied. 

On July 14, 2016, Judge Thomas D. Schroeder ordered that parties in the four related cases of HB2 file a short joint notice identifying any agreements reached and explaining their respective positions. On July 25, 2016, the Court consolidated this case with <i>Carcaño v. McCrory</i>(1:16CV236), <i>Berger v. United States</i> (1:16CV844), and <i>North Carolinians for Privacy v. United States</i> (1:16CV845) for discovery purposes only. After this consolidation, the Plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed <i>Berger v. United States</i> on July 28, 2016, and <i>North Carolinians for Privacy v. United States</i> on August 31, 2016.

On August 12, 2016, the Defendants submitted motions to stay the proceedings in light of the Supreme Court hearing the <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=14977"">G.G.</a> case regarding similar issues. Ten days later, the United States submitted a response in opposition to the Defendants' request to stay the proceedings. The United States stated that the Defendants were violating federal laws and that the proceedings should not be delayed in anticipation of a change in the law. 

On December 16, 2016, upon the joint motion of the parties and in the interest of judicial economy, the court stayed the proceedings in the case and in the related case of <i>Carcano v. McCrory</i> (1:16CV236) pending disposition in the Supreme Court of Gloucester County School Board v. G.G., No. 16- 273 (S. Ct.). At the United States’ request, the court did not include the United States’ pending motion for preliminary injunction in the stay. 

On January 1, 2017, Roy Cooper, who opposed HB2 as NC Attorney General, took office as Governor of North Carolina, changing the Governor’s position. On February 22, 2017, the Department of Justice and the Department of Education, under President Trump, withdrew and rescinded their earlier guidance documents, changing the federal government’s position. On March 2, 2017, the Plaintiff submitted a request to expand the stay (granted on December 16, 2016) to include the preliminary injunction request, on the grounds that the United States had withdrawn two guidance documents upon which the motion was based. 

On March 28, 2017, the Plaintiff submitted a joint status report with the Carcaño Plaintiffs, UNC Defendants, Legislative Defendants, and the State Defendants. The United States aligned itself with the UNC and Legislative Defendants requesting that the court leave the stay entered on December 16, 2016, until resolution of the pending appeals in <i>G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board</i> (4th Cir. No. 15-2056) and <i>Carcaño v. Cooper</i> (4th Cir. No. 16-1989). The Carcaño Plaintiffs and the State Defendants requested that the stay be lifted so that parties could confer about a new discovery plan. 

On March 30, 2017, the North Carolina Legislature, and the newly appointed Governor enacted House Bill 142 which, among other things, repealed HB2. The repeal included a compromise that left many on both sides unhappy. The compromise prevented municipalities from passing anti-discrimination laws until December 2020, and the legislature still had the ability to regulate bathrooms. 

On April 14, 2017, the Plaintiff filed a notice of voluntary dismissal stating that in light of the passage of House Bill 142, the claims and causes of actions against the Defendants would be dismissed with prejudice, which closed the case.

A lawsuit has been filed by the United States of America against the state of North Carolina and its governor, Patrick McCrory, for violating federal laws that prohibit discrimination based on sex, specifically targeting transgender individuals. The complaint, initially filed on May 9, 2016 and re-filed the following day to comply with local rules, names several defendants including the North Carolina Department of Public Safety, the University of North Carolina, and the University of North Carolina Board of Governors. The plaintiffs argue that a recently passed law, H.B. 2, discriminates against transgender individuals by requiring them to use multiple-occupancy bathrooms and changing facilities based on their biological sex rather than their gender identity. The law was passed in response to a local ordinance in Charlotte that allowed transgender individuals to use facilities based on their gender identity. Governor McCrory and legislators openly stated their intention to overturn the ordinance and prevent transgender individuals from using facilities consistent with their gender identity. The plaintiffs are seeking a declaration that the defendants are in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, Title IX, and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act, and are requesting a preliminary and permanent injunction to prevent further violations. Attorneys representing the plaintiffs include Torey Brent Cummings, Whitney Michelle Pellegr",0.8056,0.1286,0.2218,0.3535,0.0562,0.097,0.3981,0.0636,0.1096

The complaint was brought on behalf of a woman who had Hepatitis C and alleged that the defendant violated Title I of the American with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA) when it subjected the complainant, a deli worker, to an unlawful medical exam/inquiry, demoted her, then constructively discharged her because of her disability.  

The charging party intervened, and all parties agreed to proceed in front of a magistrate.  The EEOC fought for and was awarded a protective order allowing the suit to be brought without identifying the complainant's real name.

  

In March 2007, the case was settled. In a consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would refrain from discriminating on the basis of disability, revise its ""Sick Partners"" policy, issue a neutral reference letter, expunge the complainant's employee files, pay the complainant $50,000, ensure that it was correct if it terminated anyone for having a communicable disease, post EEO notices, provide EEO training to all its employees, and submit a compliance reports.  No fees or costs were awarded.  The terms of the decree run for two years. The docket sheet does not show any further enforcement; the case was presumably closed in 2009.

This case, titled ""Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.

The EEOC represents an individual, referred to as Jane Doe, who was diagnosed with Hepatitis C and faced discrimination by the company. The EEOC alleges that Brookshire Grocery Company subjected Jane Doe to an unlawful medical inquiry and examination, demoted her, and forced her to resign due to her disability. The EEOC invoked the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and requested a jury trial. The EEOC also filed a motion for a protective order to keep Jane Doe's real name confidential. The defendant, Brookshire Grocery Company, argued against the protective order, stating that there was no evidence that revealing Jane Doe's name would cause harm. The court granted the EEOC's motion and allowed the lawsuit to proceed under a pseudonym. The EEOC and Brookshire Grocery Company ultimately reached a settlement agreement, or consent decree, which required the company to pay $50,000 to Jane Doe and provide training to its employees on disability discrimination and food safety.",0.5144,0.4592,0.4853,0.1836,0.1638,0.1731,0.2692,0.2403,0.254
EE-IL-0075,"The Chicago District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against the Dial Corporation, who makes soap and other hygiene products, in May 1999, in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  The suit was based on sexual harassment and retaliation claims in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  The docket indicates that the parties had numerous discovery motions, mostly protective orders and orders to compel, and two individuals intervened.  The defendant filed a motion for summary judgment, which was granted in part and denied in part.  The defendant filed an interlocutory appeal of that ruling, which was dismissed by the Seventh Circuit Court of Appeals.

The terms of the consent decree included both injunctive and monetary relief.  Dial had to pay $10,000,000 into a settlement fund that was to be dispersed to eligible class members.  Because the suit was based on a general hostile work environment at the Montgomery, Illinois facility, the class was open to any female working at the facility before the suit was started, who provides evidence they were harassed.  If they are admitted by the EEOC to the class then they are eligible to receive a portion of the settlement fund, up to a $300,000 maximum for any member of the class.  The amount given to each member of the class is to be determined by the EEOC and the Court before the payments are made.  Dial was ordered not to retaliate against any person who complains of harassment and they are not allowed to harass or discriminate based on gender.  In addition they must rework their harassment policy and complaint procedures.  There will be three decree monitors who will provide assistance to Dial during this time and help ensure that they follow the required aspects of the decree.  All current employees and managers at the Montgomery facility must undergo EEO training, and all future employees must undergo it as well.  The decree included a dispute resolution policy to help avoid future court action; however, either party may seek court enforcement if the dispute resolution fails.

This document, ""Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v.

The EEOC acted as the plaintiff, representing a group of female employees at Dial's Aurora facility who alleged a pattern of discrimination in hiring, promotions, and pay practices. The plaintiffs sought injunctive relief, back pay, and compensatory and punitive damages for the class. Dial, the defendant, denied the allegations but was ultimately found liable for systemic discrimination against women. The case also involved allegations of sexual harassment in the workplace, which Dial attempted to prevent from being heard. The plaintiffs were represented by the EEOC and the defendant was represented by attorneys from Seyfarth Shaw LLP. After a motion for summary judgment was denied, the case proceeded to trial and was treated as a class ""pattern or practice"" case. The court found that Dial's hiring process disproportionately favored men, and that women were paid less and passed over for promotions in favor of less qualified men. Additionally, the plaintiffs alleged a widespread pattern of sexual harassment at Dial's facility dating back to 1988. The court ultimately found Dial liable for allowing sexual harassment to occur and awarded the plaintiffs monetary damages",0.4953,0.3003,0.3739,0.0939,0.0568,0.0708,0.2383,0.1445,0.1799

The transcript of a motion hearing held on September 7, 2005, before Honorable John W. Primomo, a US Magistrate Judge, in the case of EEOC v. Nexion Health at Broadway, Inc., provides a detailed account of the legal battle between Terrance Dareell Johnson, a certified nursing assistant (CNA), and his former employer, Nexion Health. Johnson, an African American, filed a lawsuit against Nexion Health for creating a racially hostile work environment, citing repeated use of racial slurs by a nursing home resident towards him. Despite Johnson's complaints, no action was taken by the nursing home, and he was ultimately fired for alleged misconduct. The United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) brought the case on Johnson's behalf, claiming a violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The EEOC argued that the harassment Johnson experienced was severe and pervasive, creating an objectively hostile work environment. However, the district court granted summary judgment for Nexion Health, prompting the EEOC to appeal the decision.

On May 11, 2020, the Texas State Conference of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the Texas Alliance for Retired Americans, and six individuals filed this lawsuit against the Texas Secretary of State, challenging the constitutionality of the laws restricting vote by mail. The plaintiffs brought this lawsuit as a declaratory action under 28 U.S.C. §§ 2201-02, and as an injunctive action under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, alleging that the current vote by mail system was in violation of the plaintiffs' First, Fourteenth, and Twenty-Fourth Amendment rights. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that the requirement that voters pay for the postage to return their early voting ballots by mail, the postmark requirements for the ballots, the requirement that voters must submit two handwriting samples that “match” in order to have their early voting ballots counted, and the criminalization of a person assisting a voter in returning a marked mail ballot denied the plaintiffs equal protection and procedural due process, and violated the prohibition on poll tax. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and preliminary and permanent injunctive relief requiring the defendants to provide prepaid postage on the ballot carrier envelopes used to return the marked mail-in ballots to the counties and enjoining them from rejecting vote-by-mail ballots if those ballots were postmarked by 7:00 p.m. on election day and received by the county election administrator before it canvased the election and from implementing, enforcing, or giving any effect to the Voter Assistance Ban. They further sought to enjoin the defendants from rejecting mail-in ballots on signature verification grounds, and sought an injunction requiring the defendants to provide voters the opportunity to cure any issues with signature verification before their ballots are rejected. This lawsuit was filed at the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, and assigned to Judge Orlando L. Garcia. The plaintiffs were represented by private attorneys. 
 
The defendants moved to dismiss the case on June 3, arguing that the sovereign immunity bars plaintiffs’ claims, that the plaintiffs lack standing and that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim.

This document, titled ""Voto Latino et al v. Hughs,"" is a collection of court filings for a case (5:20-cv-577) brought by multiple plaintiffs against Ruth Hughs, the Texas Secretary of State. The plaintiffs include organizations such as Voto Latino and the Texas Conference of the NAACP, as well as individual voters such as Linda Jann Lewis, a 73-year-old African-American woman with a disability. The defendant, Ruth Hughs, is being sued in her official capacity. The plaintiffs allege that the state's current election rules and procedures, including the refusal to subsidize postage for mail-in ballots and the signature-verification process, violate their constitutional rights and make it more difficult for them to vote. They are seeking declaratory and injunctive relief to prevent further harm and restore their voting rights. The attorneys involved in the case include a team from the ACLU of Texas, the Campaign Legal Center, and the Texas Civil Rights Project. They argue that the laws disproportionately affect certain groups, such as the elderly, individuals with disabilities, and minority communities, and have presented four claims for relief, including an Anderson-Burdick claim and an equal protection claim.

DR-CO-0001,"Two minors and their mother and their mother sued the Colorado Department of Motor Vehicles.  Colorado law required that a teenager log a certain amount of hours driving under the supervision of a licensed parent or guardian. Because the mother is blind, she was unable to supervise her daughters' driving.  The girls' father did not have custody and lived out of state, leaving no qualified adult to supervise them in completeing the requirements for a driver's license.	

The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants failed to make a reasonable modification of Colorado law, which violated Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. § 12101 et seq., and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794.

The plaintiffs sought a declaration that the defendants had violated the federal statutes, an injunction against the defendants' further discrimination, monetary compensation, attorney's fees and costs, and other equitable relief.

Under Colorado law, individuals who are 16 can apply for a minor's driver's license provided they have logged 50 hours of driving experience with their learner's permit, under the supervision of a qualified adult. C.R.S. §§ 42-2-104(1)(c) & 106(1)(a). Another statute, C.R.S. § 42-2-106(b) (2004), restricts minors with learners' permits to driving under the supervision of ""a parent, stepparent, or guardian with a valid driver's license.""

On May 27, 2005, the legislature amended § 42-2-106(b) (2004) to include grandparents with powers of attorney as acceptable supervisory drivers, but the mother stated she would not relinquish her parental rights to her daughters' grandfather. Thus again, under the amended statute there was no eligible driver for supervision.  On August 10, 2005 the DMV allowed the mother to sign a ""designation"" giving the grandfather permission to supervise but indicating that she was ""in no way relinquishing any parental rights.""

On October 17, 2005, in an unpublished order, the District Court dismissed the individual claims of the minor named plaintiffs because they were not themselves disabled. Although they had an association with their mother, who is disabled, there was no employment relationship with the defendant, which is required for ""associational disability"" claims. The court permitted the organizational plaintiffs and the mother to continue the lawsuit.

On January 04, 2006, the court granted the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider its previous opinion and reinstated the minors as named plaintiffs. The court held that a party, although not herself disabled, may assert claims under Title II of the ADA and under the Rehabilitation Act for discrimination against a disabled person that directly injures that party. 

The older daughter obtained her driver's license on November 14, 2005, two months after she turned 16.  She claimed compensatory damages because of the two-month delay and because she had not been able to experience driving under different road conditions over the previous year, having compressed her entire learning experience into two months. 

On July 1, 2006, the legislature further amended the statute to allow the appointment of an alternate permit supervisor who holds a valid Colorado driver's license and is twenty-one years or older, without any relinquishing of parental rights or power of attorney over the child. Nonetheless, the plaintiffs continued the lawsuit.

On May 14, 2007, the court granted the defendants' motion for summary judgment in an unpublished opinion, 2007 WL 1430103. The court found that after the amended statute mooted the claims for equitable relief, the only remaining claim was for compensatory damages under Section 504 of the  Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794. However, because the plaintiffs could not prove that the defendants acted intentionally -- i.e. with ""deliberate indifference to the strong likelihood that pursuit of its questioned policies will likely result in a violation of federally protected rights,"" they could not sustain a claim for damages. The court denied the plaintiffs' motion to reconsider in an unpublished opinion on June 21, 2007.	

<b>Appeal</b>

In a published opinion on April 15, 2009, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the district court order granting summary judgment to the defendants. Barber v. Colorado, Dept. of Revenue, 562 F.3d 1222 (9th Cir. 2009). The Ninth Circuit agreed that the plaintiffs failed to prove intent as the Rehabilitation Act required. Especially relevant were the facts that the DMV offered reasonable accommodation by allowing the mother to designate the grandfather as a supervisor and that the DMV was aware the state legislature was progressing towards amendment. The Court of Appeals' mandate on is the final entry on the district court docket, on  May 7, 2009.

The case of ""Marcia Barber v. State of Colorado"" involved a lawsuit filed by Marcia Barber and her daughter Julianna against the State of Colorado and its Department of Revenue and Division of Motor Vehicles. The plaintiffs alleged that a state statute, which restricted minors from obtaining a driver's license if their parent, stepparent, or guardian was unlicensed, violated the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The plaintiffs sought damages and injunctive relief, and the case eventually went to court. Marcia, who is visually impaired, requested an accommodation to allow her to supervise her daughter's driving until she turned 16, but this request was denied. The attorneys involved in the case included those representing the plaintiffs and the defendants, as well as the Attorney General of Colorado. After a series of court proceedings and appeals, the district court initially ruled in favor of the defendants' motion for summary judgment. However, the plaintiffs filed a motion to reconsider, which was denied, and they subsequently appealed the decision. The final verdict in this case was that the state statute was in violation of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the plaintiffs were awarded damages and injunctive relief.

ID-CT-0002,"On February 8, 1990, the Connecticut Traumatic Brain Injury Association filed a class action lawsuit against the Connecticut Departments of Mental Health and Mental Retardation and various state hospitals in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut.  Plaintiffs were a class of persons with intellectual disabilities or traumatic brain injuries and who were or may be placed in Norwich or Fairfield Hills Hospitals.  They were represented by Connecticut Legal Services, the Connecticut Office of Protection and Advocacy, and private attorneys.  The complaint alleged violations of the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Plaintiffs sought to enjoin the practice of placing non-dangerous brain injured individuals and individuals with intellectual disabilities in state hospitals for the mentally ill, where necessary treatment and training was not available.    

The defendants moved to exclude those class members who were voluntarily placed into the hospitals and the District Court (Chief Judge Peter C. Dorsey) denied the motion on April 4, 1995.  Conn. Traumatic Brain Injury Assoc. v. Hogan, 161 F.R.D. 8 (D. Conn. 1995).    

Thereafter, the parties settled the claims of the class members with intellectual disabilities on the eve of trial.  Chief Judge Peter C. Dorsey entered a stipulation and order on August 2, 1995 which approved the settlement terms.  The defendants agreed to place half of the class members with intellectual disabilities into community settings by June 30, 1996 and the remaining by June 30, 1997.  The defendants also agreed to provide services to the class members in accord with the standards, policies, and procedures developed in the CARC v. Thorne (ID-CT-0001) litigation.  After those transfers, the Fairfield Hills Hospital and Norwich Hospital were to be closed, and the portion of the case relating to class members with intellectual disabilities was to be dismissed. 

The case continued with respect to claims of class members with brain injuries.  Note that the PACER docket did not contain hyper-links to case pleadings and orders and we did not have copies of subsequent case documents.  Information on the history of this litigation for the period of August 2, 1995 to November 2002 was limited to the PACER docket entries.

According to the PACER docket, following the partial settlement, the case proceeded to trial, beginning on July 25, 1995 and continuing through August 16, 1995.  It appears that the trial was then recessed and stayed by the court so that the parties could pursue settlement negotiations.  Negotiations continued and the parties participated in numerous court ordered settlement conferences with mediator, Attorney Cousins.  The remaining issues in the case did not settle.

Trial as to the claims of brain injured class members reconvened in February, 2001.  The docket indicates that following post-trial motions and briefs, the District Court entered judgment for the defendants and closed the case on November 26, 2002.

DR-TN-0001,"On August 10, 1998, two named plaintiffs, both of whom had paraplegia and used wheelchairs, filed a class action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Middle District of Tennessee, against the State of Tennessee and 25 Tennessee counties. The plaintiffs alleged past and ongoing violations of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. §§12131-12165.  The plaintiffs claimed that they had been denied access to the Tennessee state court system because of their disabilities. One plaintiff alleged that when he was ordered to appear at a county courthouse whose courtroom was on the second floor without elevator access, he had to crawl up two flights of stairs to reach the courtroom. When he next returned to the courthouse he refused to pull himself up the stairs again and for safety reasons declined being carried up by security personnel. As a result he was arrested and jailed for failure to appear. The other plaintiff was a certified court reporter who alleged that because she was not able to access many Tennessee county courthouses she lost work opportunities and was denied the opportunity to participate in the judicial process. The plaintiffs sought money damages and injunctive relief to modify the inaccessible courthouses.

On October 5, 1998, Tennessee moved to have the case dismissed on Eleventh Amendment Grounds, arguing that Title II of the ADA was invalid to the extent that it authorized private parties to file federal lawsuits for money damages against states. On November 10, 1998, the District Court denied this motion. Tennessee appealed to the federal Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and proceedings in the district court were stayed while this appeal was pending. On July 16, 2002, the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the District Court's denial of the motion to dismiss (Judge Boyce F. Martin, Jr writing for a three-judge panel). Lane v. Tennessee, 40 Fed.Appx. 911 (2012). The Court of Appeals granted a rehearing on the issue before the same three-judge panel, and on January 10, 2003 it issued an Amended Judgment, wherein the Court (Judge Martin) again affirmed the lower court's decision and explained that, because the Plaintiffs were ""seeking to vindicate"" their due process ""right of access to the courts,"" the action was not barred by the Eleventh Amendment. Lane v. Tennessee, 315 F.3d 680 (2003).

Tennessee petitioned for certiorari from the Supreme Court of the United States, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.  At this point the United States of America, represented by attorneys from Department of Justice Civil Rights Division, joined the Plaintiffs as respondents. On May 17, 2004, the Supreme Court, in an opinion by Justice John Paul Stevens, upheld the constitutionality of the ADA's application against states.  The Court found that Congress had abundant evidence that the states frequently denied people with disabilities fundamental rights protected by the Due Process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, including the right to access courts. Further, the remedy Congress enacted was congruent and proportional, because the ""reasonable accommodations"" mandated by the ADA were not unduly burdensome and disproportionate to the harm. Garrett, the Court said, covered only Equal Protection claims, not Due Process claims. Therefore the law was constitutional. Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509 (2004).

On August 17, 2004, the District Court denied the Plaintiffs' motion to certify the class, finding that the question of whether each particular member of the proposed class was discriminated against because of their disability would need to be determined on an individual basis, considering the conditions of the particular courthouses, and that therefore class action was inappropriate.  Shortly thereafter the parties began negotiating settlements.

In February and March of 2005, the Plaintiffs entered separate settlements with the State of Tennessee and with each of the defendant counties. Tennessee agreed to pay the Plaintiffs $905,000 in attorneys' fees and costs. Tennessee also agreed to recommend to the Tennessee Supreme Court that it implement a comprehensive policy ensuring ADA compliance at state and county courthouses.

Each of the counties agreed to make modifications to their courthouses to make them accessible to wheelchair users and other people with mobility impairments. The Defendants agreed to cooperate in the appointment of ninety-five Local Judicial Program ADA Coordinators. Each county agreed to pay $2,680, totaling $67,000, in attorneys' fees and costs. The Plaintiffs did not receive money damages.","

The plaintiff sued the US and Frontier Airlines. The plaintiff, represented by private counsel and the ACLU, asked the court for compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees, and any other relief the Court may deem appropriate. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants violated her right to be free of discrimination as a passenger, as well as her right to equal protection and freedom from unreasonable searches and seizures under the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments. 

On September 11, 2011, the plaintiff was on a flight from Denver to Detroit. She was seated next to two men described as being of South Asian descent. The plaintiff did not know the men or communicate with them in any way throughout the flight. During the flight, the men began to exhibit suspicious behavior and Frontier Airlines was accordingly notified of a potential threat. In reporting this threat, the plaintiff was identified as part of the threat under the suspicion that she may have been traveling with the two men. When the plane landed, armed guards forcefully arrested the plaintiff and moved her to a detention facility in Wayne County, where she was held and searched for approximately four hours. The plaintiff alleged that since the police and TSA officers had no facts connecting her to criminal activity, they must have acted on the perceived ethnicity, national origin, or race of the plaintiff's name. The plaintiff was released without any charges. 

On May 20, 2013, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the equal protection claims against the named federal individuals. The Court (Judge Terrence Berg) held that the defendants were not entitled to qualified immunity and denied the motion to dismiss.

Wasiukanis, Captain Patrick Driscoll, Mark DeBeau, Officer Grant,Toya Parker, Detective Carmona, and Officer Johnson, who are law enforcement officers of the Wayne County Airport Authority (""WCAA Defendants""). The motions are brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(b)(6) and 12(c), respectively, and both assert that the individual law enforcement defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiff's claims that her arrest and detention on September 11, 2011, was in violation of her rights to Equal Protection. The court denied the motion. (Hebshi v. United States, 12 F. Supp. 3d 1036 (E.D. Mich. 2014))

On July 18, 2014, the court denied a motion submitted by the individual plaintiffs for partial summary judgment as to Counts V and VI. The motion is brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 12(c), asserting that the WCAA Defendants are entitled to qualified immunity as to Plaintiff's claim that her arrest, detention, and search were in violation of her Fourth Amendment rights under the United States
Constitution to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. The court dismissed the motion. (Hebshi v. United States, 32 F. Supp. 3d 834 (E.D. Mich. 2014), appeal dismissed (Feb. 6, 2015))

Throughout the November and December 2014, several settlement conferences were held between the remaining defendants and the plaintiff--wherein a settlement was reached between the parties. 

Under the settlement terms that have been disclosed, the plaintiff will receive $40,000 from the federal government to compensate her for the severe humiliation she suffered. Additionally, under the settlement, Frontier has agreed to amend its employee handbook to more clearly state its zero-tolerance policy on discrimination and to provide all new employees with training on that revision. Frontier also will amend its customer complaint policy to ensure allegations of discrimination are given the appropriate attention.

As a result, when Sheriff’s deputies arrived, the plaintiffs were not able to communicate or explain what had happened. Nonetheless, the complaint alleged that the deputies failed to provide a sign language interpreter or any other effective auxiliary aid. Instead, one of the individuals was arrested for allegedly hitting the second individual, despite the attempts by both to explain that no violence had occurred. While in custody, the arrestee was required to sign several forms that he did not understand, including a Miranda form acknowledging that he knew his rights. Throughout his 25-day detention at the Adams County Detention Facility, staff failed to provide him with appropriate auxiliary aids or services. He was unable to call anyone, to communicate during his medical intake, or understand why he was being detained.

This lawsuit followed. It was filed November 23, 2011 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition the two deaf individuals just described. The plaintiffs sued the Sheriff of Adams County in his official capacity under the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act. Represented by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition Legal Program, they sought declaratory and monetary relief, and an injunction requiring the defendant to provide qualified sign language interpreters or other appropriate auxiliary aids or services to ensure effective communication with deaf and hard-of-hearing individuals. 

On January 26, 2012, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two additional individual plaintiffs. One was another deaf individual who communicated only through American Sign Language. He was detained at the Adams County Detention Facility for six days and unable to communicate during his detention. The other plaintiff was his aunt. The amended complaint also added the Colorado Association of the Deaf as a plaintiff.
 
On March 13, 2012, District Judge John L. Kane referred the case to Magistrate Judge Boyd N. Boland. The parties then spent the next several months engaging in settlement conversations. On September 25, they moved to dismiss the case because they had reached a settlement agreement.
 
The agreement required the defendant to change jail policies to ensure that detained individuals who required sign language interpretation knew how to request it. The settlement also required the defendants to provide training for staff, verify and monitor compliance with the agreement, and pay $100,000 to the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition Legal Program. On September 27, 2012, Judge Kane granted the parties’ motion to dismiss the case and retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement for two years. There are no further docket entries. The enforcement period was scheduled to end in 2014, so the case is now closed.","

This document, Case 1:11-cv-03074-JLK-BNB Document 35, is a comprehensive overview of a civil action filed by the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition (CCDC) and the Colorado Association of the Deaf (CAD) against the Arapahoe County Sheriff's Office (ACSO) in the United States District Court for the District of Colorado. The plaintiffs, including Timothy Siaki and Kimberlee Moore of CCDC, Michaelee Owen and Jeanine Roybal of CAD, and CCDC itself, are individuals with disabilities and members of CAD. They allege that the defendant, ACSO, a public entity responsible for law enforcement and detention activities in Adams County, Colorado, has violated the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act by failing to provide auxiliary aids and services for effective communication. The plaintiffs seek relief in the form of an injunction to prevent further discrimination, damages, and attorneys' fees and costs. They are represented by attorneys Kevin William Williams and Andrew C. Montoya of CCDC, who are dedicated to advocating for the rights of individuals with disabilities. The court proceedings involved the plaintiffs filing a complaint and the defendant responding with a motion to dismiss, which was eventually settled with the court retaining jurisdiction",0.65,0.2515,0.3626,0.2513,0.0969,0.1399,0.32,0.1238,0.1785
CW-CA-0005,"This lawsuit was filed in the Central District of California on July 18, 2002, by the class of children and young adults who (a) are in the custody of Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services; (b) have a behavioral, emotional, or psychiatric impairment; and (c) need individualized mental health services.  The suit is against County and State agencies for neglecting their responsibilities to provide mental health care services to foster children in California.  Plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief from the State and Los Angeles County under provisions of the Medicaid Act, Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic and Treatment (EPSDT), 42 U.S.C. § 1396; the Substantive Due Process clause of the 14th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution; Article I, section 7(a) of the California Constitution; the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 701; and California Government Code § 11135.   Plaintiffs are represented by the ACLU of Southern California, Center for Public Interest, Western Center for Law and Poverty, Protection & Advocacy, Inc., Youth Law Center, and Bazelon Center for Mental Health Law. 

In March 2003, Plaintiffs and L.A. County began settlement negotiations.  On June 19, 2003, United States District Judge A. Howard Matz certified class status, and on July 16, 2003, the Court approved a jointly submitted settlement agreement as fair, reasonable, and adequate.  The settlement agreement has four objectives: (1) to facilitate a provision of services delivered in a coordinated, comprehensive, community-based fashion; (2) to support the development and delivery of a service structure and fiscal system that supports core practices and services model; (3) to support an effective and sustainable solution that will involve standards and methods to achieve quality-based oversight; and (4) to address the need for certain class members with more intensive needs to receive medically necessary mental health services in their own home, a family settings, or the most homelike setting appropriate to their needs, in order to facilitate reunification, and to meet their needs for safety, permanence, and well-being. 

Pursuant to the Agreement, the parties to the settlement appointed a six-member expert advisory panel to determine whether the County met the objectives set forth and implemented the plans. The Panel was required to make regular written reports to the parties and Court of its findings and recommendations. In August 2005, the Panel issued a two-year report finding that the County had not complied with the terms of the Agreement. 

Because the state agencies did not participate in the settlement, plaintiffs moved for a preliminary injunction against them on September 15, 2005. Judge Matz granted the motion on March 14, 2006, ordering the State to provide ""wraparound services"" and ""therapeutic foster care,"" to thousands of Medi-Cal eligible children who are in foster care or at risk of foster care placement. There are approximately 85,000 children in foster care in California and an even greater number of children served by the child welfare system in their own homes. The court's order extends to both groups of children.  

(In the meantime, on February 16, 2006, Plaintiffs filed a Motion to Compel Compliance with the Settlement Agreement against LA County. In November 2006, Judge Matz ordered the County to address deficiencies in its implementation plan.)

The State of California appealed to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. On March 23, 2007, the Ninth Circuit vacated the March 14th, 2006, preliminary injunction, holding that Judge Matz had erroneously interpreted the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) provisions of the Medicaid Act by not ""explor[ing] the possibility that the State might only have an obligation to fund the component services of wraparound and TFC, rather than to offer the coordinated complex of services in a single package."" Katie A. v. Bonta, 481 F.3d 1150 (9th Cir. 2007).

After further discovery, Plaintiffs filed another Motion for Preliminary Injunction against the state defendants on January 11, 2008. In response, the Court ruled that wraparound services are Medi-Cal eligible and ordered the parties to address how to provide and bill for those services. A Special Master was appointed in March 2009 to facilitate a settlement between the parties.

The parties reached a settlement agreement in December 2011, which included the development of an Implementation Plan to be evaluated by the Special Master. The agreement included a payment of $3.75 million in attorneys' fees, including costs and expenses, to plaintiffs' counsel. The parties developed a two-phase Implementation Plan. On August 28, 2012, the Special Master informed the District Court that he found the Implementation Plan reasonably and sufficiently calculated to meet the objectives of the agreement, and the Court accepted his recommendations on September 13, 2012. 

The Special Master and Advisory Panel continued to monitor and report on the completion of the Implementation Plan. 

In light of the fact that the District Court's jurisdiction was scheduled to end in December 2014, the Special Master put forth a set of recommendations in his report on September 26, 2014 to sustain the growth in the development and delivery of the intensive services agreed to by the parties. The Special Master submitted a final report to the Court on November 20, 2014. The report identified areas of progress and growth, but also found that there remained significant unfinished deliverables from the settlement agreement and identified the key activities the State should begin or continue implementing.

A status conference was held on November 24, 2014. Judge John A. Kronstadt determined that there was no need for the court to extend its jurisdiction at that time. Subsequently, in August of 2015, Judge Kronstadt issued a minute order stating that while the parties should continue to file reports consistent with the implementation of the settlement, the matter was considered closed. As of October 19, 2017, the parties had stipulated, with approval from the court, that the Panel monitoring L.A. County's progress toward implementation of the settlement agreement should continue to operate through December 31, 2018.

On December 21, 2018, the Panel issued its report for 2017. The plaintiff then filed this report with the court on January 23, 2019. The 2017 report identified major continuing concerns regarding the County's slow progress in implementing the settlement and uncertainty that County strategies would succeed in implementing the Shared Core Practice Model, which the report identified as a key strategy for compliance. The Panel noted its hope that the County's work would have developed data indicators that reflected progress towards full implementation, but because the County has concluded its data systems will not support those tasks, other strategies would be needed to improve performance. Among other things, the report was particularly troubled by the County's decision to change from using an Immersion Process, in which the Shared Core Practice Model would be fully implanted in only a few offices every eighteen months, to instead deciding to use a countywide approach in an attempt to reform all 19 offices and 3 specialized units simultaneously. The Panel report expressed doubt that this approach would bring the County any closer to full implementation of the Shared Core Practice Model, and disapproved of the County's decision to make this change without first notifying the parties or Panel, both of which had treated the immersion approach as a part of the strategic plan. 

According to Bloomberg, the case is now closed. ","

The document in question, titled ""Katie A. v. Bonta: A Comprehensive Look at a Class Action Lawsuit,"" is a compilation of various segments from a class action lawsuit filed in California in 2002. The plaintiffs, represented by their counsel Debora K. Biggers from the Western Center on Law and Poverty, brought the lawsuit against state officials, including the Director of the California Department of Health Services, Diana Bonta, and the Director of the Department of Social Services, Trish Ploehn. The lawsuit alleged that the defendants had failed to provide necessary wraparound and therapeutic foster care services to children in foster care with documented mental health needs, in violation of the Medicaid Act and its implementing regulations, the Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnostic, and Treatment (EPSDT) program. These services were deemed medically necessary and mandated under the EPSDT program, but the defendants argued against the plaintiffs' claims, stating that they were already being provided through the state's Medicaid program.

The plaintiffs sought relief in the form of a preliminary injunction, requiring the defendants to provide the necessary services to eligible children. The attorneys involved in the case included representatives from the Western Center on Law and Poverty, as well as attorneys from other legal organizations such as the California Attorney",0.7381,0.1243,0.2128,0.2727,0.0457,0.0784,0.419,0.0706,0.1208
NS-DC-0077,"On June 9, 2014, a complaint was filed by the Competitive Enterprise Institute (CEI) against the National Security Agency (NSA) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia for failing to fulfill two Freedom of Information Act requests for records pertaining to the conduct of the EPA. 

The case was filed after the NSA issued a Glomar response, in which it declined to provide the requested information, and instead refused to confirm or deny that it possessed the request records.

According to the complaint, this lawsuit stems from repeated incidents of the EPA circumventing federal recordkeeping laws by using personal devices, including email accounts and text messages, to conduct work-related correspondence and otherwise federal business. As revealed by its Inspect General, NSA is known to have a program to collect metadata from telephone, text message and email records from certain telephony carriers including Verizon. CEI requested the copies of all text message data, and particularly all metadata of text messaging activity using Verizon voice and/or data accounts in NSA’s possession. 

On September 5, 2014, defendant filed for summary judgment. 

In response, the plaintiffs argued that NSA has waived its right to issue such a response by its previous official acknowledgment that it has the records they seek. The judge found that despite their FOIA requests for email and text records, the plaintiffs failed to identify any evidence showing that the NSA actually collects this information on a widespread basis. 

On January 13, 2015, the court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendant. The court stated that plaintiffs failed to point to concrete evidence showing that the NSA has actually admitted this fact.

The court entered a judgment for the defendant on the same day. The case is closed. ","

The plaintiffs, representing organizations dedicated to transparency and accountability in environmental and energy policies, have filed a lawsuit against the NSA for violating their rights. The defendant has filed a motion for summary judgment, denying the existence of requested records and citing national security concerns. The plaintiffs have requested an extension to file their response, which has been granted by the Court. On October 14, 2014, the plaintiffs filed their opposition, detailing the alleged violations and providing evidence from a declaration and exhibits. The defendant then filed their reply, along with a proposed order. However, the plaintiffs subsequently filed a motion for leave to file a surreply, which contains individual summaries from different segments of the original document. The Court has granted this motion. The case is ongoing and currently in the process of reviewing the arguments presented by both parties.

This document is a Notice of Removal filed by the defendant, Texas Coast Waffles, Inc., in response to a lawsuit filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC).

DR-PA-0001,"On March 3, 2003, Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania (DIA) brought this action against the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA) alleging that SEPTA violated the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12101 (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794 (RA) after it completed two construction projects on its public transit facilities in Philadelphia and did not make the facilities sufficiently accessible to people with disabilities. 

DIA, represented by attorneys from the Disability Law Project and a private disability rights firm, asked the court for injunctive relief requiring SEPTA to make the stations accessible to persons who use wheelchairs by constructing elevators at the City Hall Station and the 15th Street Courtyard, which provides access to the 15th Street Station. 

Specifically, DIA alleged that SEPTA replaced an existing stairway at the 15th Street Courtyard without making the entrance accessible to persons in wheelchairs, and that SEPTA replaced an existing escalator at the City Hall Station Broad Street entrance but did not make the entrance accessible to persons using wheelchairs. 

DIA's fourth amended complaint alleged that SEPTA violated the ADA and RA by making ""alterations"" to the 15th Street Courtyard and the City Hall Station without also making the affected portions of the facilities accessible to individuals with disabilities. Additionally, DIA alleged that the 15th Street Station and City Hall Station were ""key stations"" under the ADA and RA. Therefore, SEPTA was required to make those stations handicapped accessible. 

On May 15, 2003, the United States District Court Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Judge Clifford Scott Green) granted SEPTA's motion to dismiss under Federal Rules of Civil Procedure R. 19(b) for DIA's failure to join the City of Philadelphia as a defendant. SEPTA argued that joinder of the City of Philadelphia was required, because the property at issue was owned by the City. On June 4, 2003 the District Court (Judge Green) granted DIA's motion vacating the May 15, 2003 order granting dismissal. On June 12, 2003, DIA filed an amended complaint, which included the City of Philadelphia as a defendant. 

DIA reached a settlement agreement with the City of Philadelphia on August 16, 2004. The terms of the agreement provided that the City encouraged and would permit SEPTA to construct ADA-compliant elevators at the City Hall Station and the 15th Street Courtyard. On August 19, 2004, the case was reassigned and on November 30, 2004, the Court (Judge Gene E.K. Pratter) granted DIA's motion to dismiss the City of Philadelphia pursuant to the settlement agreement.

On January 7, 2004, DIA filed its third amended complaint, adding the ""key station"" claim. On December 23, 2004, the District Court (Judge Pratter) granted in part and denied in part SEPTA's motion to dismiss and motion to strike portions of DIA's third amended complaint. Specifically, the District Court (Judge Pratter) denied SEPTA's motion to strike DIA's allegations that SEPTA violated the ""key station"" provisions of Title II of the ADA, but DIA was ordered to strike allegations relating to an alleged agreement SEPTA made to construct elevators at City Hall in lieu of construction of an elevator at the 15th Street Station. 

On February 15, 2005, DIA filed a fourth amended complaint, and alleged that SEPTA's renovations to both the 15th Street Courtyard and City Hall Station constituted ""alterations"" that triggered ADA and RA accessibility obligations.

The parties filed cross motions for summary judgment on April 5, 2006. On November 17, 2006, the Court (Judge Pratter) granted SEPTA's motion for summary judgment regarding all of DIA's claims. Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., No. 03-CV-1577, 2006 WL 3392733 (E.D. Pa. Nov. 17, 2006). The Court (Judge Pratter) held that DIA's claims were barred by the two-year statute of limitations, because the claims accrued when DIA knew, or had reason to know, that SEPTA's renovations would not include elevators. DIA filed its claims more than two years after those dates. DIA subsequently appealed. 

On March 27, 2007, the United States filed an amicus curiae brief in support of DIA urging a reversal of the Court's summary judgment in favor of SEPTA. 

On August 19, 2008, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Judge Michael D. Fisher; Judge Thomas M. Hardiman, Judge Walter King Stapleton) reversed the District Court and remanded the case. Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., 539 F.3d 199 (3rd Cir. 2008). The Third Circuit (Judges Fisher, Hardiman, Stapleton) held that the accrual date of a discrimination claim depends on when the discrimination occurred and that discrimination did not occur until the construction was completed. Therefore, DIA's claims were not barred by the statute of limitations. 

On November 04, 2008, DIA filed its motion for summary judgment. On January 16, 2009, SEPTA filed its motion for summary judgment. On September 11, 2009, the United States District Court Eastern District of Pennsylvania (Judge Pratter) granted DIA's motion for summary judgment. Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., 655 F. Supp. 2d 553 (E.D.Pa. 2009). The Court (Judge Pratter) held that SEPTA's construction work at both the 15th Street Courtyard and City Hall Station were ""alterations"" under the ADA and RA. Therefore, the ADA and RA required SEPTA to make both locations readily accessible to individuals with disabilities. 

SEPTA appealed the District Court decision. On February 16, 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (Judge Julio M. Fuentes, Judge Kent A. Jordan, Judge Anthony Joseph Scirica) affirmed the District Court's decision granting summary judgment in favor of DIA Disabled in Action of Pa. v. Southeastern Pa. Transp. Auth., No. 09-3964, 2011 WL 522947 (3rd Cir. Feb. 16, 2011). The Third Circuit held that the ADA must be interpreted liberally to provide equal access for disabled persons to public facilities. The court concluded that the City Hall Station and 15th Street Courtyard construction projects were ""alterations"" under the ADA, even though they were not ""major structural alterations."" Additionally, the court held that the ADA required SEPTA to make the alterations ""to the maximum extent feasible"" regardless of their cost, because ""feasible"" referred to technical matters and not economic costs. Furthermore, the court held that the 15th Street and the City Hall stations were not already ""readily accessible"" merely because there were disabled accessible elevators at other portions of the underground concourse connecting the 15th Street, City Hall, and Suburban Station.

On remand, the case finally settled; a consent decree was entered September 16, 2011, approved by Judge Pratter.  The decree provided that SEPTA would install several elevators at the relevant stations, make fare lines accessible, and pay attorneys fees of about $500,000.  It also required SEPTA to provide status reports to plaintiffs counsel, quarterly.

The agreement lasted until 2013. The case is now closed.","

The Consent Decree, officially titled ""Disabled in Action v. Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority,"" outlines the agreements made in the case 2:03-cv-01577-GP between Disabled in Action of Pennsylvania (DIA) and the Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority (SEPTA). DIA, a non-profit organization advocating for the civil rights of individuals with disabilities, filed a complaint against SEPTA for failing to provide adequate accessibility at two subway stations undergoing renovations. The specific issue at hand was SEPTA's alleged violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act (RA) by not making the stations accessible during construction. DIA sought an injunction requiring SEPTA to install elevators at the 15th Street and City Hall locations. The attorneys involved were Stephen F. Gold and Benjamin D. Geffen for DIA, and John J. Rocco, Jr. for SEPTA. After a series of legal proceedings, including motions, appeals, and arguments over the definition of ""exit,"" the court ultimately found in favor of DIA, stating that their claims were timely and reversing the District Court's decision.

NS-VA-0004,"The plaintiff was a naturalized U.S. Citizen denied boarding to a flight from Kuwait to the United States because of his alleged inclusion on the No Fly List. On January 18, 2011, he filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia against the Department of Homeland Security (""DHS""), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (""FBI""), the Transportation and Security Administration (""TSA""), and the Terrorist Screening Center (""TSC""), which created and maintained the No Fly List. The plaintiff, represented by the Council on American Islamic Relations, alleged that his placement on the No Fly List constituted: (1) a violation of his right as a United States citizen to reside in the United States and re-enter it from abroad; (2) unlawful agency action in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act; and (3) a denial of procedural due process under the Fifth Amendment. The plaintiff sought injunctive relief requiring defendants to remove him from the No-Fly List; inform him of the grounds for his inclusion on the No-Fly List; and provide him with an opportunity to rebut his inclusion. The plaintiff also sought monetary damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and a declaration that the defendants violated his rights. The case was assigned to Judge Anthony J. Trenga.

Contemporaneously with the complaint, the plaintiff also filed an emergency motion with respect to his alleged inability to return to the U.S. from Kuwait. The relief requested in the motion became moot, however, when the plaintiff was permitted to return to the U.S. on January 21, 2011.

On June 3, 2011, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss based on lack of subject matter jurisdiction, claiming that jurisdiction to hear the plaintiff’s claims lies exclusively in the U.S. Court of Appeals under 49 U.S.C. § 46110, which gave the U.S. Court of Appeals exclusive jurisdiction over challenges to certain orders of the TSA. Judge Trenga agreed and held that it lacked jurisdiction to consider the plaintiff's challenge to past or future restrictions on his ability to travel because such claims are ""inescapably intertwined"" with the review of TSA orders. 2011 WL 3820711. Instead of dismissing the plaintiff's claims, however, the court transferred the plaintiff's claims to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.  

Before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, the plaintiff contended that the district court did have jurisdiction, and thus, requested that his claims be remanded. On May 28, 2013, the Fourth Circuit agreed. In an order signed by the Court's clerk, the Fourth Circuit explained that 49 U.S.C. § 46110 did not evidence Congress' intent to exclude the plaintiff's challenge to past and future restricts on his ability to travel from consideration in the district court.

On remand, the defendants again filed a motion to dismiss, contending that the plaintiff's claims must be dismissed because he failed to exhaust administrative remedies, that he lacked standing, that his claims were not ripe for adjudication, and that he failed to state a claim for which relief may be granted.    

On January 22, 2014, Judge Trenga granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion.  2014 WL 243115. The Court held that the plaintiff was not required to exhaust administrative remedies, had standing, and that his claims were ripe. The Court then dismissed a portion of the plaintiff's first claim for relief, concluding that four to five day delay that the the plaintiff experienced in his ability to reenter the U.S. did not unduly burden his rights such that it constituted a constitutional deprivation. The court, however, found that the plaintiff's broader allegations in his first claim for relief of present and future harms from his inability to fly were sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss. The court also held that plaintiff's procedural due process claim was sufficient to withstand the motion to dismiss as the plaintiff did not receive any notice of his inclusion or reasons for his inclusion. The parties then engaged in discovery for the next year.

On December 9, 2014, the plaintiff moved for partial summary judgment as to his procedural due process claim. The plaintiff claimed that the defendants failed to provide him with a meaningful opportunity to challenge his inclusion on the No Fly List, either before or after his inclusion, depriving him of various liberty interests. The defendants contended that the redress process established through the DHS Traveler Redress Inquiry Program (""TRIP"") was constitutionally sufficient. On July 16, 2015, the court issued an order partially granting the plaintiff's motion for summary judgment. Specifically, the court concluded that the plaintiff was denied his Fifth Amendment right to an adequate opportunity to challenge his inclusion on the No Fly List. 

On April 13, 2015, the defendants filed a notice stating the government's new redress procedures for claims submitted through DHS regarding denial of boarding on a covered aircraft, and that these new procedures would be available to the plaintiff should he wish to use them. 

The plaintiff filed a fifth amended complaint on December 28, 2015. On March 3, 2016, using arguments that are unavailable on the docket, the defendants moved for summary judgment of the plaintiff’s substantive due process and non-delegation claims of the fifth amended complaint. That same day, the plaintiff moved for summary judgment of those same claims, arguing that  the No Fly List interfered with his fundamental right of movement and was not narrowly tailored and that the No Fly List was operating in the absence, and in some ways against, the wishes of Congress.

On July 20, 2017, Judge Trenga granted the defendants’ motion for partial summary judgment and denied the plaintiff’s. The court concluded that the No Fly List was not unconstitutional on substantive due process grounds because it was not unlawful under the non-delegation doctrine nor did it exceed agency authority. As such, the court entered judgment in favor of the United States and against the plaintiff.

The plaintiff appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Not long after, however, the plaintiff voluntarily dismissed this appeal and the Fourth Circuit obliged on December 21, 2017. There are no pending motions or appeals so the case is presumably closed.

The defendants in these cases are government agencies, including the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the Department of Homeland Security, who are responsible for maintaining and implementing the watchlists and the redress process. The plaintiffs, represented by private attorneys and lawyers from organizations such as the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), allege that their placement on the watchlists violates their constitutional rights, including the right to travel and due process. The court proceedings involve arguments over standing, jurisdiction, and the sufficiency of the DHS TRIP process, with some courts ruling in favor of the defendants and others allowing the cases to proceed for further review.

EE-MO-0002,"On Oct. 7, 2004, the St. Louis District office of the EEOC brought this suit against Allstate Insurance Company, a major insurance provider, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Missouri. The complaint alleged that Allstate's rehire policy disproportionately and adversely impacted workers over the age of 40, in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The EEOC also brought a disparate treatment claim, alleging that Allstate refused to rehire certain former employees because of their age. The EEOC sought to permanently enjoin Allstate from discriminating on the basis age against individuals 40 years of age and older. The EEOC also wanted the court to order that Allstate implement policies, practices, and programs providing equal employment opportunities for individuals 40 years of age and older. Finally, the EEOC sought back wages and liquidated damages for adversely affected employees. 

In 1999, Allstate implemented a Reorganization Plan, which eliminated all employee-agent positions and terminated the employment contracts of its employee-agents. In connection with the Reorganization Plan, Allstate implemented a rehire moratorium policy in 2000. Under the policy, former employee-agents who were subject to the Reorganization Plan were ineligible for rehire in non-agent positions for a period of one year after their termination, or after all severance benefits had been received. The EEOC alleged that the rehire moratorium policy had disparate impact on former employee-agents who were members of the protected age group and that Allstate engaged in disparate treatment of such members of the protected age group.

Both sides filed motions for partial summary judgment in June 2006, and in October 2006 District Judge E. Richard Webber denied Allstate's motion but granted in part the EEOC's motion. The court held that although no material issue of fact existed as to the EEOC's prima face case of disparate impact, Allstate had provided sufficient evidence that the challenged employment policy was adopted based on reasonable factors other than age. Since the EEOC had the ultimate burden of showing that Allstate's reasons for the policy were unreasonable, and had provided sufficient evidence of unreasonableness, the court held that question was not appropriate for summary judgment. 458 F. Supp. 2d 980 (E.D. Mo. 2006).   

In Jan. 2007, Allstate was given leave in the district court to file an interlocutory appeal, at which point the case was stayed pending the result of that appeal. No. 4:04CV01359 ERW, 2007 WL 38675 (E.D. Mo. Jan. 4, 2007). Allstate appealed on two questions of law: (1) whether Allstate’s rehire policy is an “employment policy”
which can be challenged under a disparate impact theory of discrimination; and (2)
whether the statistics proffered by the EEOC and adopted by the district court
establish disparate impact as a matter of law. On June 10, 2008, Eighth Circuit Judge Myron H. Bright answered both questions in the affirmative, holding that Allstate's rehire policy could be challenged under ADEA and that the EEOC's statistical evidence established a prima facie case that the rehire policy had a disparate impact. 528 F.3d 1042 (8th Cir. 2008). 

However, on September 8, 2008, the Eighth Circuit granted Allstate's Petition for Rehearing En Banc and vacated the June 10, 2008 judgment. That same day, the Eighth Circuit dismissed the appeal for lack of jurisdiction and the case went back to district court. 

After proceedings resumed in the district court, there was additional discovery. On Sept. 11, 2009, the parties filed a joint motion to approve the parties' proposed Stipulated Order resolving all claims in this action. On Sept. 14, 2009, District Judge Webber issued a Stipulated Order containing the terms of the parties' settlement agreement. 

With respect to injunctive relief, Allstate agreed that before adopting any new policy limiting the re-employment of former employees whose employment was terminated involuntarily as part of a reorganization or reduction-in-force, it will determine whether such a policy disproportionately affects individuals who are age 40 and above. If the policy does disproportionately impact those 40 or older, Allstate agreed to refrain from implementing the policy until it gives the EEOC 14 days written notice of its implementation, provides a list of reasons for the policy, and gives reasonable opportunity to meet and discuss with the EEOC. Additionally, Allstate agreed that any new policy would comply with the requirements of the ADEA. However, there was no admission of liability by Allstate.

With respect to monetary damages, Allstate agreed to pay a total of $4.5 million to individuals affected by the rehire policy. The settlement agreement required that the EEOC provide notice to all eligible claimants, giving them a chance to comment on or object to the methodology for allocating the $4.5 million settlement fund. The agreement specified that the court would retain jurisdiction over the case for three years.

Following the notice and comment period, Judge Webber issued a Settlement Allocation Order on Dec. 15, 2009. The Settlement Allocation Order approved of the proposed Distribution Plan, stating that it was a fair and reasonable allocation of the monetary relief provided under the Stipulated Order, and rejected all of the claimants' objections.

On Jan. 14, 2010, Judge Webber finalized the settlement. The three year period of the court's jurisdiction passed without further litigation, and the case is now closed. "," 

This document, titled ""Summary of EEOC v. Allstate Insurance Company: Allegations of Age Discrimination in Employment,"" provides a comprehensive overview of the case brought by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against Allstate Insurance Company. The plaintiffs, represented by the EEOC, include a group of former employees over the age of 40 who were not rehired by Allstate as part of a reorganization plan in 1999. The EEOC alleged that this rehire policy had a disparate impact on older workers and violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). They sought back wages, damages, and an injunction against Allstate's discriminatory practices. Allstate, represented by their own attorneys, argued that the policy was a legitimate business decision. After multiple court proceedings and motions, the case proceeded to a jury trial, where the EEOC presented evidence of the policy's negative impact on older workers. The court ruled in favor of the EEOC, stating that the policy was unreasonable and violated the ADEA. This decision is seen as significant in establishing the ADEA's protection against disparate impact discrimination, and Allstate has since reached a settlement agreement with the EEOC.

PB-MI-0026,"On July 12, 1999, several medical, dental, and child advocacy organizations, along with several individuals, filed this class-action lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiffs sued the directors of the Michigan Department of Health, the Medical Services Administration, the Michigan Medical Services Administration, and the Michigan Department of Community Health under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs, represented by The Public Interest Law Center, in collaboration with Dechert LLP, Michigan Legal Services, the National Health Law Project, and the Michigan Association for Children with Emotional Disorders, sought injunctive relief to prevent state officials from violating the Medicaid law, claiming violations of federal Medicaid laws. 

The plaintiffs alleged that the state of Michigan failed to provide essential dental and medical services, known as Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment Services (“EPSDT services”) required by the Medicaid program to eligible minors. The plaintiffs alleged that Michigan’s Medicaid system paid doctors and dentists too little to ensure that they would be willing to treat patients on Medicaid, such that low-income families faced a dangerous shortage of essential care for their children. The case was assigned to Judge Robert H. Cleland.

On October 14, 1999, the plaintiffs filed a motion seeking class certification of children eligible for EPSDT services. 

On November 9, 1999, the defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Clearinghouse does not have access to this document so it is unclear by what reasoning the defendants sought judgment. 

On December 28, 1999, Judge Robert H. Cleland granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ motion for judgment on the pleadings. The Clearinghouse does not have access to this document so it is unclear which parts were granted or denied. 

On March 26, 2001, Judge Cleland entered an order denying the plaintiffs’ motion to certify the class and granting the defendants’ motion to dismiss. Judge Cleland held that the substantive defendant, in this case, was the state of Michigan and that Ex parte Young was inapplicable, meaning state sovereign immunity doctrine barred this type suit against the state. While the Constitution says that federal statutes are the “supreme law of the land,” Judge Cleland ruled that because the Medicaid program was enacted under Congress’ spending power and is a consensual, contractual agreement between the states and Congress, it is not encompassed by the supremacy clause. Thus, Congress cannot compel states to participate in the program and individual state actors, indistinguishable from the state, retain “constitutional sovereignty from the suit.” 133 F.Supp.2d 549.

Judge Cleland also held that even if there were no immunity from these suits, Section 1983 did not authorize suits against states or state officials for failure to carry out the terms of a federal grant program like Medicaid. The Supreme Court has required a historical statutory construction when construing Section 1983 and Judge Cleland found “no such clear, unambiguous intent to subject States to private suit.” 133 F.Supp.2d 549.

On April 4, 2001, the plaintiffs appealed this decision to the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The Sixth Circuit (Circuit Judges Merritt, Boggs, and Moore) delivered its opinion on May 15, 2002, in which it reversed the district court’s decision on all issues presented. The court held that conditions imposed by the federal government upon states participating in Medicaid do not arise out of a contractual agreement; they are federal laws. The court also ruled, in line with “well-established precedent,” that laws passed by Congress under its spending powers are supreme law of the land. Furthermore, while the district court ruled that Ex parte Young was unavailable to the plaintiffs, the Sixth Circuit held that because the plaintiffs sought relief from state officials for those officials’ alleged violations of federal law, this case was squarely within Ex parte Young and thus allowed to proceed. Lastly, the court held that the plaintiffs did have a cause of action under Section 1983. The case was remanded back to the district court. 289 F.3d 852. 

With the case back in the district court, the plaintiffs moved for class certification on October 14, 2015, and filed an amended complaint on October 18, 2015. The Clearinghouse does not have access to these documents so it is unclear what was different in the amended complaint. 

Accordingly, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment on November 29, 2004. 

On April 22, 2005, Judge Cleland granted in part and denied in part the defendants’ 2004 motion to dismiss and/or for summary judgment. Judge Cleland addressed the plaintiffs’ claim that the defendants failed to provide EPSDT services to all eligible children by holding that plaintiffs stated a cause of action to the extent that they alleged that the state of Michigan has a policy or practice of not providing the EPSDT services to eligible children who have requested them. Addressing the plaintiffs’ second claim, Judge Cleland held that the plaintiffs lacked a cause of action because the Medicaid statute did not “unambiguously confer rights enforceable under Section 1983.” Finally, Judge Cleland denied the plaintiffs’ final claim that the defendants failed to adequately inform eligible individuals of programs and services available through Medicare, holding that it was not their duty to inform all potentially eligible children of EPSDT services. 368 F.Supp.2d 740.

On May 17, 2005, the district court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class certification and entered judgment in favor of the defendants. The plaintiffs appealed this judgment the next day. 

On July 7, 2006, the Sixth Circuit (again before Judges Merritt, Moore, and now Chief Judge Boggs) affirmed in part the district court’s dismissal of the claims under the Medicaid statutory provisions but reversed the holding that there was no cause of action for failing to inform all potentially eligible children of EPSDT services. The appeals court also modified the district court’s order to reflect a dismissal without prejudice, which allowed the plaintiffs to file an amended complaint to allege that Michigan's inadequate payment system effectively denied many eligible children the right to medical assistance. The case was remanded back to the district court. 454 F.3d 532. 

On October 11, 2006, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in the district court. The complaint alleged that the reimbursement rates provided by the defendants were so low that an insufficient number of providers were willing to care for children who were enrolled in Medicaid. The plaintiffs further claimed that these inadequate payments effectively denied the plaintiffs and the class of minors eligible for Medicaid represented in the suit the right to medical assistance. 

On August 7, 2007, the parties entered into a Settlement Agreement that resulted in the case being dismissed without prejudice. The settlement preserved significant expansions of the state’s program and major increases in rates paid to doctors and dentists for treating Medicaid patients. The settlement also required the state to monitor children’s access to care, which it had never done before the settlement. Finally, the settlement provided for ongoing oversight of the state’s program by representatives of the plaintiffs. 

The case is now closed. ","

The document, titled Westside Mothers v. Haveman, is a comprehensive settlement agreement between the plaintiffs, represented by Dr. Charles Barone and his team of attorneys, and the State of Michigan, represented by Neil Oppenheimer and his team of attorneys. The plaintiffs in this case are a group of low-income mothers from the Westside of Detroit, known as the Westside Mothers, who allege that the state has violated their rights under the federal Medicaid program. They claim that the state has failed to provide necessary healthcare services, specifically Early and Periodic Screening, Diagnosis, and Treatment (EPSDT) services, to economically disadvantaged children. The defendants in this case are state officials, including the director and deputy director of the Michigan Department of Community Health and Medical Services Administration.

The plaintiffs bring their case under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, seeking injunctive relief and the appointment of a special master to address the state's alleged failure to provide adequate medical care. The attorneys involved in the case include representatives from both the plaintiffs and defendants, as well as the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), which oversees the Medicaid program. The court initially dismissed the case, citing the state's sovereign immunity and lack of jurisdiction. However, on appeal,",0.7692,0.1333,0.2273,0.3913,0.0676,0.1152,0.4087,0.0708,0.1207
IM-GA-0017,"This federal class action lawsuit sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief for over 60 immigrant women who were detained in ICE custody at the Irwin County Detention Center in Ocilla, Georgia. The plaintiffs claimed that they were subjected to medical abuse while in ICE custody including nonconsensual hysterectomies, overly aggressive gynecological care, and medically unnecessary procedures. In addition to the medical abuse itself, the plaintiffs sought relief against federal officials and the local employees of the ICE jail who, the plaintiffs claimed, engaged in a widespread conspiracy to silence the detainees from sharing their abuse with the public and retaliated against women who spoke out about the conditions at the detention center. 

<i>Procedural Background: </i>
This federal class action lawsuit commenced on November 9, 2020, with a petition for a Writ of Habeas Corpus and Declaratory and Injunctive Relief and an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order filed by Yanira Oldaker in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Georgia (in Valdosta). At the time of the initial filing, Yanira Oldaker was a detainee of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) at Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC also referred to below as “the ICE jail”) in Ocilla, Georgia. The November 9 motion named ICE, the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Department of Justice (DOJ) as defendants. 

On November 16 and 17, 2020, two other women detained at ICDC filed separate habeas petitions in the same district court. (Trial dockets 7:20-cv-00231 and 7:20-cv-00237). On November 18, 2020, District Judge W. Louis Sands ordered the two new habeas petitions to be consolidated into the Oldaker case which had been referred to Magistrate Judge Stephen Hyles. A fourth ICDC detainee joined the consolidated action on November 23, 2020, also seeking a writ of habeas corpus.

On November 25, 2020, the district court granted a consent motion to revise a scheduling order agreed to by the four plaintiffs and the defendants who now included ICE, DHS, DOJ, and ICDC. In the revised scheduling order, the government agreed to not deport any of the four plaintiffs or any other ICDC detainees who wished to file similar habeas petitions or motions for temporary restraining orders at least until a hearing on the motions for temporary restraining orders was held. The plaintiffs agreed to file a consolidated habeas petition and consolidated motion for temporary restraining order for all individuals at ICDC with substantially similar factual allegations as themselves by December 21, 2020. 

<i>The Amended Habeas Petition/Class Action Complaint, and the Amended Motion for a Temporary Restraining Order:</i>
The plaintiffs met the deadline they agreed to and submitted an amended habeas petition together with a class action complaint (the complaint) and an updated emergency motion for a temporary restraining order on December 21, 2020. 

Represented by the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, Morningside Heights Legal Services, Project South, a small Atlanta based law firm, and law school clinics from Boston University, Harvard, Texas A&M, and the University of Georgia as counsel, the plaintiffs sought injunctive, declaratory, and monetary relief. In the complaint, the plaintiffs described themselves as current or former ICDC detainees who were each subjected to “non-consensual, medically unindicated, and/or invasive gynecological procedures” by the physician assigned to the ICE jail.  

The complaint set out three main categories of plaintiffs: 1) a group of nine women who were detained at ICDC at the time the complaint was filed, 2) four women previously detained at ICDC who had been either deported from the U.S. or released from the ICE jail at the time the complaint was filed, 3) a putative class of at least 60 women who were subjected to similar medical abuse at ICDC as the named plaintiffs. The list of defendants was extensive and includes federal agencies, federal officials, employees at ICDC, the corporate defendant LaSalle Southeast, LLC which owned and operated ICDC at the time of the complaint, and the Hospital Authority of Irwin County which employed the defendant physician Mahendra Amin. 

The complaint included 21 claims for relief. The first was a habeas claim for the release of the nine detained plaintiffs from unlawful detention under 28 U.S.C. §§2241, 2243 and the common law to remedy the “egregious and systematic retaliatory behavior” of the defendants. 

In claims two through four, the plaintiffs sought a remedy for violations of their First Amendment Rights. The second claim alleged retaliatory conduct by federal respondents against ICDC detainees in violation of the First Amendment rights of speech and petition. The plaintiffs claimed that their testimony to federal investigators and communications to the press regarding medical abuse was met by adverse actions by federal respondents including deportations and attempted deportations of individual plaintiffs and putative class members, use of force, solitary confinement, and denial of privileges at the ICDC. The plaintiffs claimed that their exercise of free speech was “chilled” and that they suffered physical and/or psychological harm. The second claim sought damages against federal respondents pursuant to Bivens, declaratory relief finding their actions in violation of the First Amendment, and injunctive relief prohibiting further retaliation by federal officials against the exercise by plaintiffs of First Amendment protected conduct. The third claim is similar to the second but described the retaliation committed by ICDC, LaSalle, and their employees/officials including the defendant physician and is based on the incorporation of the First Amendment in the Fourteenth Amendment as a cause of action under 42 U.S.C. §1983. The retaliatory conduct committed by these non-federal actors included the placement of plaintiffs in solitary confinement, cell restriction, physical assault, assault of handcuffed detainees, threats of deprivation of property and commissary to hunger strikers, denial of access to the law library, monitoring of phone calls, destruction of outgoing correspondence, and the making of false claims to congressional investigators. Plaintiffs sought the same injunctive and declaratory relief against state officials as they did against the federal respondents and ask for both compensatory and punitive damages. As an alternative to the third claim, claim four restates the allegations of retaliation committed by the non-federal respondents but argued that if claim three failed, the court should find that the ICDC and LaSalle employees/officials were acting under color of federal authority and can be sued for damages pursuant to Bivens. 

In the fifth, sixth, and seventh claims of the complaint, the plaintiffs sought relief for violations of their Fifth Amendment rights. The fifth claim sought declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief against federal officials with the damages claim based on Bivens. The plaintiffs alleged that the federal officials who facilitated their confinement at ICDC were either motivated by evil intent or callously/recklessly indifferent to the medical abuse they endured in violation of the Fifth Amendment’s guarantee of reasonable safety and freedom from punitive confinement for people in civil immigration detention. The sixth claim sought the same type of relief as the fifth but is against the ICDC respondents and was based on the Fourteenth Amendment right to substantive due process and 42 U.S.C §1983. Like the fourth claim’s alternative theory for damages under Bivens, the seventh claim similarly argued that if the court finds that the ICDC respondents were operating solely under color of federal law, they should still be liable for damages for violating the plaintiffs’ rights to substantive due process. 

The eighth claim sought declaratory and injunctive relief against all defendants in their official capacities for violating Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act with regards to the detained plaintiffs. The plaintiffs alleged that the detained plaintiffs (all of whom have underlying medical conditions which qualify as disabilities under the Rehab Act) were excluded and/or denied benefits of the “services, programs, and activities” within ICDC. The plaintiffs argued that the only “reasonable accommodation” that would have mitigated their disabilities would have been released from detention and that because they were still detained at ICDC at the time the complaint was filed, their ongoing detention violated the Rehab Act. 

The ninth claim was against the federal defendants for violations of the Administrative Procedure Act and the Immigration and Nationality Act. The plaintiffs claimed that the deportation of two of the detainees who provided information about medical abuse to a <a href= https://projectsouth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/OIG-ICDC-Complaint-1.pdf> whistleblower</a> ICDC employee was a violation of ICE’s own policy (ICE Policy Number 10076.1) to not remove individuals from the U.S. “in the midst of a legitimate effort to protect their civil rights or civil liberties.” This disregard of its own policy by ICE amounted to a violation of the APA’s guarantee of judicial review for persons who suffer a legal wrong because of an agency action and also violated regulations promulgated under the INA which prohibit the deportation of individuals needed in the US for any investigation “being, or soon to be, conducted by any official executive, legislative, or judicial agency…”. 8 C.F.R. §215.3(h). The tenth claim was also based in APA violations by federal officials. Plaintiffs alleged that federal defendants failed to follow the Performance Based National Detention Standards (PBNDS) requirements with regards to the medical care at ICDC amounting to an unlawful agency action under the APA. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy the violations alleged in their ninth and tenth claims. 

In the eleventh claim, the plaintiffs alleged that the defendants violated 42 U.S.C. §1985 by 1) conspiring to deter detainees from attending/testifying in a pending federal court proceeding and 2) conspiring to retaliate against witnesses/participants in federal court proceedings. The plaintiffs supported these conspiracy claims with extensive allegations including examples of expedited deportations, forced transfers of detainees out of the main ICDC facility during a September 2020 visit by a Congressional delegation, and phone call monitoring all of which commenced after ICDC received notice in mid-September 2020 that federal agencies were investigating it for medical abuse. The plaintiffs sought damages, injunctive, and declaratory relief to remedy these claims. 

In the twelfth claim, the plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief against federal defendants for violating the Fifth Amendment prohibition on deportation of essential witnesses in civil proceedings.

The thirteenth claim requested a grant of bail to the plaintiffs who were petitioning for habeas. The fourteenth claim is for breach of contract. Here, the plaintiffs argued that both the federal and ICDC defendants breached the terms of the Intergovernmental Agreement (IGA) established for the administration of the ICE jail by failing to abide by the terms of the PBNDS, not providing appropriate medical care, providing medical treatment without informed consent, and by not providing language accessibility during medical care to detainees who did not speak English. The plaintiffs claimed that they were the intended third-party beneficiaries of the IGA and that they were owed damages to remedy the breach as well as injunctive relief to enforce the contract. 

Counts fifteen through twenty were tort claims, listed as follows; 15) negligent hiring or retention against ICDC, LaSalle, and Irwin County Hospital; 16) gross negligence against ICDC and its officials; 17) medical battery against the defendant physician and Irwin County Hospital; 18) medical malpractice against the defendant physician and Irwin County Hospital; 19) intentional infliction of emotional distress against ICDC and its officials; 20) negligent infliction of emotional distress against ICDC and its officials. The twenty-first claim was for attorneys’ fees and costs. It was brought under Georgia law against all ICDC defendants who committed intentional torts.  

In addition to the complaint, the plaintiffs filed an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order and petition for writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum. The temporary restraining order sought by the plaintiffs would have enjoined retaliation against them by federal and ICDC officials including use of force, solitary confinement, denial of privileges, and deportation. If granted by the court, the habeas writs sought in the emergency motion would have ordered the defendants to make the plaintiffs available for any hearings deemed necessary by the court. In the emergency motion, the plaintiffs also asked for the release from ICDC of all detained plaintiffs and members of the putative class as an alternative to not granting the temporary restraining order and habeas petition. 

<i>Proceedings and Factual Changes Since the December 2020 Filings:</i>
No district court rulings had been made on the merits of any of the plaintiffs’ claims as of June 8, 2021. Only the corporate defendant, LaSalle, has filed an answer to the complaint (submitted April 15, 2021). On June 8, the government submitted a notice of new facts in opposition to the December 21, 2020, emergency motion for temporary restraining order. Though this document is not available for purchase on PACER, it likely has to do with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas’ <a href= https://www.dhs.gov/news/2021/05/20/ice-close-two-detention-centers> announcement </a> of the end of ICE’s contract with ICDC on May 20, 2021. Interestingly, according to a June 3, 2021, report by <a href= https://theintercept.com/2021/06/03/ice-irwin-closing-open-detainees> the Intercept, </a> at least 34 ICE detainees were transferred to ICDC the week after DHS claimed to have terminated the contract. As for the status of the plaintiffs in this case, the National Immigration Project of the NLG <a href= https://nipnlg.org/pr/2021_22Jan_oldaker-v-giles.html> reported </a> that all of the women who claimed medical abuse by the defendant physician had been released from ICDC as early as January 22, 2021. This claim is further corroborated by a <a href= https://www.detentionwatchnetwork.org/pressroom/releases/2021/after-years-advocacy-no-immigrant-women-are-currently-detained-irwin-county> press release </a> from Detention Watch Network that announced that no women were being detained at ICDC as of April 29, 2021.

This document, titled ""Complaint for Injunctive Relief, Damages, and Declaratory Relief,"" is a compilation of various segments from a legal case against the government agencies, DOJ, DHS OIG, and the FBI, for retaliatory and deterrent actions against individuals who have attempted to vindicate their civil rights at the Irwin County Detention Center (ICDC). The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the Government Accountability Project and Project South, include detained immigrants at ICDC and a licensed practical nurse, Ms. Dawn Wooten, who is a protected whistleblower. The plaintiffs allege medical neglect, unsafe work practices, and inadequate protection against COVID-19 at ICDC, in violation of ICE's detention standards and CDC guidelines. They also raise concerns about the high rate of hysterectomies performed on immigrant women in ICE custody at ICDC. The plaintiffs seek an injunction to prevent further retaliation and deportations, and the release of detained immigrants during the lawsuit. The court grants an injunction against ICE's actions and orders the release of detained immigrants, citing the likelihood of success on the plaintiffs' First Amendment retaliation claims. The court also considers the issuance of writs of habeas corpus ad testificandum to ensure the availability of detained witnesses for trial and evid",0.8308,0.0715,0.1316,0.315,0.027,0.0497,0.4627,0.0398,0.0733
EE-CA-0352,"On December 18, 2013, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (""EEOC""), on behalf of a Muslim crew person, filed a lawsuit in the Eastern District Court of California under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 against McDonald's Corporation.  The EEOC sought injunctive relief, compensatory damages, punitive damages, attorneys' fees and costs, and prejudgment interest, claiming that the defendant discriminated against one if its employees based on his religion, Islam, when it refused to accommodate the employee's religious belief to wear a beard at work, resulting in the employee's constructive discharge.  

The employee began working as a crew person for the defendant in around 2001 and was promoted to Crew Trainer in 2003.  In July and August 2005, the employee informed the defendant of his religious belief of wearing a beard at work.  The defendant allegedly did not allow him to wear a beard and so the employee was constructively discharged.  

On December 19, 2013, the EEOC filed an amended complaint.  Also, on the same day, the District Court (Judge Anthony W. Ishii) issued a consent decree for two years.  Among other things, the defendant agreed to pay the employee $50,000, which was characterized as non-wage compensation for emotional distress.

The decree was entered in December 2013 and scheduled to last until December 2015. No further docket entries exist, so the case is closed.

This case, titled U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. McDonald’s Restaurants of California, Inc., was filed on 12/19/2013 and assigned to District Judge Anthony W. Ishii, with Magistrate Judge Stanley A. Boone handling the case. The plaintiff, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, accused McDonald's Restaurants of California, Inc. of job discrimination in violation of 42:2000e. Represented by lead attorney Anna Y. Park, the plaintiff alleged that McDonald's failed to provide reasonable accommodation for an employee based on his religious beliefs, resulting in discrimination and retaliation. The plaintiff sought monetary relief for the employee, as well as policy changes, training for employees, and a promotion of public interest in ending discrimination. The defendant, represented by lead attorney Brett Rawitz, agreed to a consent decree and order, which was signed by District Judge Anthony W. Ishii on 12/20/2013.

PB-FL-0009,"The Plaintiff in this case has been paralyzed from the chest down ever since an accident in 2007.  She has limited mobility and manual dexterity, and thus requires some assistance in caring for herself carrying out daily activities. After her accident, she placed herself on the waitlist for Florida Medicaid's Traumatic Brain Injury/Spinal Cord (TBI/SC) Waiver Program.  

In early 2010, Plaintiff's husband and primary caregiver left her home following a divorce. She then contacted the state in the hope of receiving Waiver services but was told she would need to spend 60 days in an institution to then be eligible for community-based services to meet her needs. She then filed this lawsuit on May 13, 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the Middle District of Florida challenging this condition for receipt of services as a violation of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. She filed a concurrent complaint and motion for preliminary injunction, asking the court to order the state to immediately provide services that will allow her to remain in the community.  The U.S. Department of Justice filed a Statement of Interest supporting the Plaintiff's motion for preliminary injunction. 

At a June 15, 2010 hearing, the Plaintiff's counsel informed the court that the Plaintiff had been hospitalized due to an unrelated issue, but that she would not be able to return home without the services that the TBI/SC waiver provides.  After additional briefing, the District Court (Judge Marcia Morales Howard) granted the motion for preliminary injunction and ordered that the Plaintiff begin to receive services on June 23, 2010 so that she could be discharged from the hospital.  The court issued its full analysis in granting the preliminary injunction on July 9, 2010.  

In March 2011, the court denied the Defendants' motion to dismiss, finding that the Plaintiff had stated a claim under the ADA. At this time, the Plaintiff had been enrolled in the waiver program for several months. Thus, the parties stipulated to settle the claims with no further obligations for the Defendants. After some dispute over attorney's fees, the parties agreed to dismiss the matter on April 19, 2011.  ","

This document is a comprehensive summary of a legal dispute between plaintiff Michele Haddad and defendants Thomas Arnold, Elizabeth Dudek, Anna Viamonte Ross, and Harry Frank Farmer Jr. The case, filed in 2010, centers around allegations of discrimination and violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act. Haddad, a quadriplegic woman, filed a lawsuit against the defendants, who were responsible for overseeing a Medicaid program for individuals with disabilities. She alleged that the defendants had refused to provide her with necessary community-based services, which would allow her to continue living in her own home. Instead, they required her to enter a nursing home, which would result in involuntary isolation and segregation. Haddad was represented by attorneys Jay M. Howanitz and Stephen F. Gold, while the defendants were represented by attorneys Andrew T. Sheeran and William Michael Blocker II. The United States, represented by attorneys Beth A. Esposito, John L. Wodatch, and Philip L. Breen, also filed a motion to intervene in the case and supported Haddad's claims. After a hearing, the court granted Haddad's motion for a preliminary injunction, ordering the defendants to reassess her",0.4792,0.2466,0.3257,0.1361,0.0699,0.0924,0.25,0.1287,0.1699

Specifically, the defendant allegedly had a pattern or practice of creating a hostile work environment.  The complainants intervened in the lawsuit in June 2001.  Following discovery and several status conferences, the parties settled the lawsuit in 2002 through a consent decree.

The one-year decree, containing non-discrimination and retaliation provisions, required the defendant to: report on complaints and make other compliance reports, keep records, allow access to outsiders for monitoring, develop its anti-discrimination policy, post and distribute notice, provide EEO training, and pay $70,000 to be distributed among five individuals.

The document in question is a collection of legal documents pertaining to a case filed on March 8, 2001 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The case, titled Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) v. Majesty Maintenance Inc., involves allegations of unlawful employment practices based on sex discrimination. The EEOC, represented by attorneys from the United States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and the United States Attorney's Office, filed a complaint against Majesty Maintenance Inc., a company with at least 15 employees, for creating a hostile work environment for female employees and failing to address the harassment. Four female employees, Barbara Poltorak, Halina Katarzyna, Edyta Kurdziel, and Maria Napiorkowski, intervened in the case, alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and seeking relief for their pecuniary and non-pecuniary losses. 

After multiple status hearings and a settlement conference, a settlement agreement was reached between the EEOC and Majesty Maintenance Inc. The parties agreed to a consent decree, which was found to be fair, reasonable, and in the best interests of all parties by the court.

JC-IL-0053,"On December 23, 2015, the plaintiff, a prisoner in the Cook County jail, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiff later amended the complaint twice, adding two plaintiffs and to seeking class-action certification. The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, sued both the Sheriff of Cook County in his official capacity and Cook County itself for damages under Section 202 of the Americans with Disabilities Act, 42 U.S.C. § 12132; Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. § 794(a); and 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiffs alleged that the Cook County Jail's policy of forced tapering of inmates participating in opioid antagonist therapy caused them great physical pain and thereby deprived them of their Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights. The plaintiffs sought class-action certification and compensatory damages for their pain and suffering. The case was assigned to Judge Edmond E. Chang.

The named plaintiffs all entered the Cook County Jail between late 2013 to early 2014. During that time, the plaintiffs informed intake personnel of their enrollment in opioid antagonist therapy. Each experienced extremely painful withdrawal symptoms after administration of their prescribed medical treatment was delayed. One entered the jail on January 20, 2014, and did not receive treatment until January 26, 2014. The second entered the jail on December 23, 2013, and did not receive treatment until December 25, 2013. The third entered the jail on September 12, 2013, and did not receive treatment until September 20, 2013.

The defendants filed a motion to dismiss the claims, but Judge Chang denied the motion on June 27, 2016. Judge Chang noted that the plaintiffs may face difficulty in proving their claim, but declined to evaluate the facts at that stage of the litigation.

On November 29, 2020, the court granted class certification for the plaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims and denied class certification for the plaintiffs’ Americans with Disabilities Act and Rehabilitation Act claims. 2020 WL 7027556. The court held that the plaintiffs’ Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment claims raised “questions that are necessarily common to all class members,” such as Cook County Jail officials’ state of mind when developing the tapering policy, whereas the plaintiffs’ ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims required individualized determinations. The court divided the class it into two classes: “Pre-trial Detainees” consisted of all pre-trial detainees who entered the Cook County Jail between December 23, 2013 and October 7, 2019 and who were lawfully taking an opioid antagonist when they entered. ; “Post-sentence Prisoners” consisted of all post-sentencing prisoners who were lawfully taking an opioid antagonist when they entered the Cook County Jail between the same time period.

This case is ongoing. ","
The document in question is a court order issued in the case of Keith Rogers, James Hill, and Wanda Hollins v. Sheriff of Cook County, Illinois, which involves a class action lawsuit against the Cook County Jail. The plaintiffs, Keith Rogers, James Hill, and Wanda Hollins, are individuals with disabilities who were part of an opioid agonist therapy program at the Jail. They allege that the Sheriff of Cook County and Cook County itself violated their rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act and the Rehabilitation Act by not adequately providing medical services while they were detained in the Jail. The plaintiffs seek certification of a class of individuals who were lawfully taking an opioid antagonist and entered the Jail on or after December 23, 2013. The defendants argue that the injuries and symptoms vary among the class members and that the plaintiffs cannot proceed as a class. The court ultimately certified the plaintiffs' Fourteenth and Eighth Amendment claims as a class action for both pre- and post-trial detainees, but denied the motion for class certification for the Americans with Disabilities Act claim. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys Kenneth Flaxman and Joel Flaxman, while the defendants are represented by attorneys David Bonner and Michael Sorich. The case has gone through various motions and filings,",0.6944,0.3289,0.4464,0.2977,0.1407,0.191,0.3657,0.1732,0.2351
PC-MS-0001,"On February 8, 1971, inmates at the Mississippi State Penitentiary at Parchman, Mississippi filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. §§ 1981, 1983, 1985, and 1994, against the Penitentiary, the Mississippi Penitentiary Board and the Governor in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, Greenville Division.  The plaintiffs, represented by the ACLU National Prison Project and private counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, alleging that conditions and practices in the maintenance, operation and administration of the Parchman facility violated their First, Eighth, Thirteenth and Fourteenth Amendment rights.  Further, the plaintiffs alleged that black inmates were segregated and discriminated against on the basis of their race.

On August 23, 1971, the U.S. Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division was allowed to intervene. In its complaint, the government alleged that the defendants maintained a system of prison facilities segregated by race, and additionally failed to provide inmates with adequate housing, medical care, and protection from other inmates, that conditions of the sewage disposal and water systems created an immediate health hazard, and that prison officials permitted the custodial staff, including inadequately trained armed trustees, to inflict cruel and unusual punishment upon inmates.

After a full evidentiary hearing on May 15, 1972, on September 13, 1972, the District Court (Judge William Colbert Keady) issued findings of fact and conclusions of law. Gates v. Collier, 349 F. Supp. 881 (N.D. Miss. 1972).  The court found the defendants practiced racial discrimination, provided inadequate physical facilities, medical facilities and protection of inmates, inadequate training to trustees, excessive disciplinary rules, punishment without adequate procedure, and unconstitutional censure of mail. The court found conditions violative of inmates' First, Sixth, Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment rights, and issued an injunctive order providing immediate, intermediate and long-range relief.  The defendants appealed the Court's award of attorneys' fees as well as the Court's ruling on the merits of the case.  On December 5, 1973, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals (Judge Elbert Tuttle) affirmed the District Court's order.  Gates v. Collier, 489 F.2d 298 (5th Cir. 1973). On September 9, 1974, the Fifth Circuit denied the defendants' petition for a rehearing. Gates v. Collier, 500 F.2d 1382 (5th Cir. 1974).

On September 20, 1974, the Fifth Circuit (Judge Tuttle) affirmed the District Court's ruling on the merits. Gates v. Collier, 501 F.2d 1291 (5th Cir. 1974).  The Court held that jurisdiction was proper and that conditions that deprived inmates of basic hygiene and adequate medical treatment, including solitary confinement, as well as failure to protect inmates from violence by other inmates and mail censorship, were unconstitutional.

The plaintiffs moved for further relief, alleging the defendants failed to comply with the Court's order and, on January 31, 1975, the District Court (Judge Keady) granted in part and denied in part injunctive relief.  Gates v. Collier, 390 F. Supp. 482 (N.D. Miss. 1975).  The Court denied some relief, holding that opening and inspecting, but not reading, inmates' mail was constitutional and that racial discrimination at the penitentiary had been mostly eliminated, but granted some relief, holding that the state's continuing failure to provide for inmates' physical health and well-being, and for adequate facilities, contravened the Eighth Amendment.  The plaintiffs appealed.

On January 8, 1976, the Fifth Circuit held that the District Court's refusal to modify the previous injunctive order with respect to racial discrimination and training and its modification of the order with respect to mail regulations was not an abuse of discretion. Gates v. Collier, 525 F.2d 965 (5th Cir. 1976).

On November 19, 1976, the District Court (Judge Keady) issued a temporary restraining order enjoining enforcement of various provisions of the Mississippi Corrections Act. Gates v. Collier, 423 F. Supp 732 (N.D. Miss. 1976). The Court further requested the convening of a three-judge court to consider a more permanent injunction concerning inmate housing units that were unfit for human habitation and constitutionally condemned, as well as a ceiling on inmate population of the remaining housing units to avoid unconstitutionally intolerable overcrowding of inmates.  The defendants appealed.

On March 18, 1977, the Fifth Circuit (per curiam) affirmed and remanded the case to the District Court to continue the implementation of conversion to a constitutionally permissible penal system.  Gates v. Collier, 548 F.2d 1241 (5th Cir. 1977).

After the defendants moved for adoption of revised disciplinary rules, on June 30, 1978, the District Court (Judge Keady) held that revising the disciplinary rules was permissible so long as they did not infringe on the inmates' constitutional rights, and entered a modified version of the defendants' proposed revisions.  Gates v. Collier, 454 F. Supp 579 (N.D. Miss. 1978).  Of note, the Court held that allowing a classification officer to also serve as a disciplinary hearing officer violated the inmates' due process rights. The plaintiffs appealed.

On November 8, 1979, the Fifth Circuit (Judge Joseph Woodrow Hatchett) affirmed the District Court's adoption of the revised rules.  Gates v. Collier, 606 F.2d 115 (5th Cir. 1979).

On January 6, 1983, the District Court (Judge Keady) awarded the plaintiffs attorneys' fees for class representation.

Subsequent litigation by HIV+ inmates was consolidated into this case. In that litigation, male HIV+ prisoners housed at Unit 28 of the maximum-security state prison at Parchman, Mississippi, and female HIV+ prisoners housed at the Central Mississippi Correctional Facility in Rankin County, filed a lawsuit on May 29, 1990, under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Mississippi Department of Corrections in the US District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, Greenville Division. The plaintiffs in that case, represented by the ACLU National Prison Project, alleged that all HIV+ prisoners, regardless of their offense or other classification factors, were housed at the same facility by gender, not allowed to participate in vocational and educational programs, and that living conditions and medical care were inadequate in these HIV+ segregated units. That case was consolidated with this one for having some similar questions of law. For more information on that case, see <ahref=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=798""> Moore v. Fordice</a>, PC-MS-0002, on the Clearinghouse.

According to the 5th Circuit in a different case, Gates v. Cook, 376 F.3d 323, in 1998, the District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi finally dismissed the action from its inactive docket as to state-owned, state-operated, and private-company-contracted facilities (not county facilities). The court also stated that it would continue to forward prisoner petitions relating to defendants' facilities to plaintiffs' class counsel.

However, litigation continued regarding compliance with court orders and issues in consolidated cases. Over the next few years, inmates were moved around to various jails and units while repairs to the Mississippi State Penitentiary were being made. The Court denied many inmates that were moved to become class members, but granted plaintiffs several post-judgment attorney fees awards over the next years.

The Moore class (of HIV+ inmates) moved to intervene in this case to challenge adequacy of class representation, but the Court denied the class's motion. The class moved the court for a preliminary injunction to provide HIV+ prisoners with adequate medical care. On July 19, 1999, the court granted this motion, requiring defendants to provide HIV+ prisoners with constitutionally adequate medical care and testing, and requiring progress reports on the implementation of the changes (the order and opinion are not available on PACER).

After alleging noncompliance with prior orders, the plaintiffs moved to supersede previous orders to allow greater inmate access to courts. The court denied this motion, but no available documents provide the court's reasoning.

The ACLU National Prison Project moved to substitute as class counsel for this litigation, though the court ordered that they could not contact inmates until it ruled on their motion. On February 2, 2000, the Court denied the ACLU National Prison Project's motion to represent the interest of HIV+ inmates at Parchman and denied plaintiff's motion to sanction the ACLU. Later, class members appealed the order prohibiting contact by the ACLU National Prison Project; during appeal, the ACLU was allowed to contact inmates only to prosecute its appeal. On February 19, 2000, the Court granted appellants' motion to stay the enforcement of the ""no contact"" order pending appeal. On April 30, 2001, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit vacated in part and reversed in part the February 2, 2000, decision. However, the details of the decision are not available.

In May of 2000, and for many years following, a number of jails were approved to house additional state inmates. In June of 2000, the Court granted in part a motion for writ of execution to collect contempt fines against the defendants. In the same month, the Court also granted a motion that required inmates to stay in one of the approved jails for at least 30 days to be counted in the jail's population. In September of 2000, the Court ordered the state to pay $1.8 million into the Court's account, and the Court would return $100,000 for each month that the state complied with prior orders. From October of 2000 to February of 2000, the state complied with Court orders and the Court denied plaintiffs' motion for contempt and for an order enforcing the Court's mandate, and granted defendants' motion for the return of $500,000 of the $1.8 million for compliance ($100,000 for each month). On March 30, 2001, the Court ordered the return of the remaining $1.3 million to the state, but retained the interest from the amount with the intention to use it for the plaintiffs' benefit.

This case was consolidated with a few other cases with similar issues whose dockets are not available, and on July 18, 2001, with the <a href="" http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=5491 "">Givhan v. Puckett</a> (PC-MS-0004), a case involving a class of Muslim inmates who sought religious freedom in prisons. Over the next few months, many filings were made in the consolidated cases, though the documents and details are not available.

On November 22, 2002, and on May 15, 2003, the court granted plaintiff's motions for modification of prior jail orders, but the details of the modification are not available. The following year, the court also ordered defendants to provide the appropriate amount of space for inmates as required by previous orders.

On May 21, 2003, the court ordered the defendants to remedy Eighth Amendment violations and report progress by July 7, 2003 (part of a consolidated case). Over the next year, the defendants submitted status reports to the court, and the court required the defendants not to discriminate against HIV+ inmates when deciding community work center placement; the Court also required the defendants to report inmate capacity to the Court following a June 4, 2004 status conference. On November 12, 2004, the Court denied a number of motions by class members, warning them that any further filings that are deemed frivolous by the court will count as strikes for the purpose of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). On March 31, 2005, the court dismissed the consolidated Moore case (4:90-cv-125), finding that both the PLRA and the compliance with previous orders had provided sufficient relief for the class. Inmates who were HIV+ had been integrated into the general prison population except for housing, and discrimination with respect to services and privileges had been addressed by the defendants.

On March 6, 2006, the Court issued an order to update the April 1997 order to require facilities to more promptly respond to notices of noncompliance from the Court. Under the order, noncompliance after two notices automatically disapproved a jail for incarceration until they were reapproved for compliance. Over the next couple of years, the jails were monitored for compliance and disapproved when not in compliance. The jail order was modified again on September 26 and November 5 of 2007, the first modification required jails to obtain periodic approval from plaintiffs' counsel, and the second required jails to provide evidence of compliance whenever plaintiffs' counsel gave notice of noncompliance. On September 9, 2008, the order was modified to require defendants to pay a flat fee in advance of jail inspections to prevent manipulation by either side.

On March 10, 2011, the Court dismissed the consolidated Stevenson and Givhan cases and the portions of this case related to the state-owned and contractor facilities. The order held that county defendants would be dismissed when the state removed all state prisoners from county jails, or on July 1, 2015, whichever came first. The case was then assigned to Magistrate Judge David A. Sanders for post-judgment proceedings. 

On May 29, 2012, the parties submitted a joint stipulation of dismissal without prejudice. Since then, the court has granted roughly 300 orders approving jails or prisons for housing state inmates. The most recent order granting approval occurred in 2017. 

On February 25, 2018, a petitioner motioned to reinstate the class action, but it was denied on February 28, 2018. The petitioner appealed this decision and which was then denied by the U.S. Court of Appeals on September 20, 2018. There has been no further action on the docket.","

Collier et al., also known as the Mississippi Prison Reform Case, which was heard in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Mississippi, Greenville Division. The case was a class-action lawsuit filed by several inmates at the Mississippi State Penitentiary against the prison officials and the state. The plaintiffs, including Nazareth Gates, Willie Lee Holms, Hal Zachary, and Mathew Winters, were represented by attorneys from the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the Southern Poverty Law Center. They alleged violations of their constitutional rights, specifically inadequate medical care, overcrowding, and subhuman living conditions at the prison. On the other side, the defendants, represented by the Mississippi Attorney General's Office, denied these allegations and presented a plan to reduce the population and improve conditions at the institution. The court issued several orders and opinions, including one in 1975 that mandated the closure of certain housing units and set maximum capacities for others.

FA-MI-0019,"On May 8, 2018, Speech First, a nationwide membership organization of students, alumni, and others concerned with preserving the protections of the First Amendment, filed this lawsuit, on behalf of members attending the University of Michigan, in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The plaintiff sued the University of Michigan under 42 U.S.C.§ 1983 and 1988. Represented by private counsel, Speech First sought declaratory and injunctive relief as well as attorneys’ fees, claiming violations of the First Amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment’s Due Process Clause. The plaintiff alleged that the University of Michigan’s policies and enforcement of those policies chilled the speech and expression of student claimants. Specifically, the plaintiff alleged that University’s policies on “harassment” and “bullying” were unconstitutionally overbroad and void for vagueness. Furthermore, the plaintiff alleged that the policies provided no notice to students on what would constitute “harassment” or “bullying,” and enforcement of the policies were implemented arbitrarily. 2018 WL 2123702. This case was assigned to Judge Elizabeth Stafford. 

On May 11, 2018, Speech First moved for preliminary injunctions against the defendant. The plaintiff sought to prohibit the defendant from: “(1)  taking any actions to investigate, threaten, or punish students for violations of the prohibitions on “harassment,” “bullying,” and “bias-related misconduct” set forth in the University’s Statement of Student Rights and Responsibilities; and (2) using the Bias Response Team to investigate, threaten, or punish students (including informal punishments such as restorative justice or individual education) for bias incidents. On June 11, 2018, the United States filed a statement of interest in support of the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.

In response, the defendant moved for a stay on its obligation to respond to the plaintiff’s complaint. The defendant argued that the University’s answer should be stayed until the court made a decision on the plaintiff’s preliminary injunction. Although the court noted that the defendant’s request served the interest of efficiency, it did not stay the defendant's answer. Instead, on June 19, 2018, the court extended the deadline until twenty-one (21) days from the date the court ruled on the plaintiff’s motion for preliminary injunction.

The court held a hearing on Speech First's motion for preliminary injunction on July 31, 2018. On August 6, the court denied the plaintiff's motion, holding that the Bias Response Team did not pose a concrete threat to the plaintiffs; that Speech First's constitutional challenge to the University's definitions of ""bullying"" and ""harassment"" had become moot after the University changed the definitions; and that there was no threat of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs. The district determined that Speech First was not likely to succeed on the merits of its claims because it lacked standing to assert that claim.

The plaintiff appealed to the 6th Circuit Court of Appeals on August 13, 2018. The Appeals Court found that Speech First had associational standing to bring a lawsuit on behalf of the students of the University. The Appeals Court also found that the claims were not moot, as the University’s voluntary cessation would not preclude them from reverting back to the prior definitions of ""bullying"" and ""harassment."" The Court vacated and remanded the District’s Court decision, determining that the District Court was in a better position to assess the facts. 939 F.3d 756 (6th Cir. 2019).

The parties agreed to settle the dispute, and each bore their own costs. The University agreed not to reinstate the Bias Response team or the prior definitions of bullying and harassment and to maintain the published definitions on the website as they were at the time of settlement. On October 28, 2019, the plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed the case. Judge Linda Parker order the dismissal with prejudice. The case is now closed.","

This document, officially titled ""Speech First, Inc. v. Schlissel, et al,"" is a legal case brought before the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan by the organization Speech First, Inc. against the University of Michigan, represented by President Mark Schlissel and other university officials. The plaintiffs, Speech First, Inc., allege that the University's policies and practices regarding speech and expression on campus, specifically their definitions of harassment and bullying, as well as their Bias Response Team and Campus Climate Support program, violate students' First Amendment rights. The defendants argue that their policies are necessary to maintain a safe and respectful environment on campus. The court initially dismissed the case, but after an appeal, it was remanded back for further proceedings. The court ultimately found that Speech First, Inc. did not have standing to challenge the Bias Response Team and that the definitions of harassment and bullying did not violate the First Amendment. As a result, the University and Speech First, Inc. entered into a settlement agreement, in which certain definitions were removed from the website and the Bias Response Team was replaced with Campus Climate Support.

PB-IL-0006,"On August 22, 2007, individuals with disabilities filed a lawsuit under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the Social Security Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and the Nursing Care Reform Act, against various Illinois state officials in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois.  Plaintiffs, represented by private and public interest counsel, asked the court for declaratory and injunctive relief, claiming that they were institutionalized in a nursing facility even though they were capable of living in a more community-integrated setting with appropriate services.  Plaintiffs claimed that Defendants conditioned receipt of long-term care on remaining in an institutionalized setting, even though it would be less expensive for Plaintiffs to receive appropriate care in the community.

The Court (Judge Joan H. Lefkow) certified a class as: ""all Medicaid-eligible adults with disabilities in Cook County, Illinois, who are being, or may in the future be, unnecessarily confined to nursing facilities and who, with appropriate supports and services, may be able to live in a community setting.""  71 Fed.R.Serv.3d 1089.

At a status hearing on January 7, 2011, the parties advised Magistrate Judge Maria Valdez that they could conclude settlement discussions without further assistance from the court.  

On Aug. 29, 2011, the parties jointly moved for the court to approve the consent decree they had agreed upon.  The court held a fairness hearing on Dec. 20, 2011, and ultimately accepted the decree.

The consent decree established benchmarks for moving specific numbers of class members out of nursing facilities and into community-based settings. Over the course of the first two-and-a-half years, the decree compelled the state to move 1,100 class members into the community. It also required the state to provide up to $10 million in housing assistance to support the first group of transitioned adults. The decree also compelled the state to develop services needed to adequately support class members who choose to live in the community. It established a monitor to ensure compliance with the decree, and granted $1.2 million in attorneys' fees. 

The court approved an updated plan following the parties' cross-motion to enter into a cost-neutral plan and supplement and amend the December 2011 consent decree on November 16, 2016. The plan included the transition of class members into community-based settings, and continued evaluations and service plans for the class members. The court retained jurisdiction to oversee the full implementation of the plan. The court approved an updated plan on April 5, 2018. Monitoring by the court appointed monitor (Gail P. Hutchings) is ongoing as of May 20, 2020.","

This document is a collection of eight separate documents pertaining to a case heard before Judge Joan H. Lefkow, with the case number 1:07-cv-4737. The case involves a class action lawsuit brought by plaintiffs Lenil Colbert, Constance Gray, Kenya Lyles, Ernest Reeves, and Dwight Scott against Governor Bruce Rauner and other officials. The plaintiffs allege that the defendants have violated the rights of individuals with serious mental illnesses by failing to provide adequate community-based mental health services. The plaintiffs seek relief through the implementation and monitoring of a consent decree, which outlines steps for improving mental health services and ensuring compliance.

PN-CA-0023,"On October 6, 2009, two individuals who had their DNA collected pursuant to a California statute filed this class action lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. Plaintiffs challenged a provision of California law which mandates the DNA collection of any individual arrested for or charged with a felony. The plaintiffs, represented by public interest counsel, sought declaratory and injunctive relief, and claimed that the practice violates substantive and procedural Due Process, as well as the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the practice infringes on rights guaranteed by the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments of the U.S. Constitution because it mandates the DNA collection of all persons <i>arrested</i> for a felony--without requiring a warrant or that the individual actually be charged with or convicted of a felony. 

In 2004, California passed Proposition 69, which expanded the scope of the state's mandatory DNA collection laws, Cal. Penal Code. §§ 295 et seq. Prior to the enactment of Proposition 69, California law provided that only persons convicted of certain felonies were subject to the mandatory DNA testing program. Under the revised statute, which took effect on January 1, 2009, any individual arrested for a felony must provide their DNA for analysis and storage in a national database accessible by federal, state and local law enforcement agencies. Proposition 69 also eliminated language in the statute which provided for the automatic expungement of a person's DNA samples and database entries if that individual's conviction was reversed.

On December 1, 2009, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added two more plaintiffs, bringing the total plaintiffs to four. None of the plaintiffs were convicted of charges related to the arrests which led to the collection of their DNA; three never had charges filed, and one had his case dismissed. 

On December 23, 2009, the District Court (Judge Charles R. Breyer) denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0003.pdf""><i>Haskell v. Brown</i>, 677 F. Supp. 2d 1187, 1190 (N.D. Cal. 2009), <i>aff'd sub nom. Haskell v. Harris</i>, 669 F.3d 1049 (9th Cir. 2012)</a>. The court found that although the plaintiffs had established that arrestees have greater privacy interests than convicted felons, they had failed to show that this interest outweighs the government's compelling interest in using arrestees' DNA to solve past crimes. The court reasoned that as a result, the plaintiffs had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits or that the balance of equities tipped in their favor.

On January 29, 2010--shortly after denying the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction--the District Court granted the motion for class certification. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0006.pdf"">Minute Entry Granting Mot. for Class Certification</a>. In doing so, the court adopted plaintiffs' proposed class description. This class description is ""all persons who have been, are, or will be, compelled to submit to the search and seizure of their body tissue and DNA pursuant to California Penal Code § 296(a)(2)(C) solely because they have been arrested for, or charged with, a felony offense.""  Proposed Order Granting Mot. for Class Certification.

The plaintiffs appealed the District Court's denial of the preliminary injunction, but on February 23, 2012, a divided three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit (Judge Milan D. Smith, Jr. writing for the majority) affirmed the District Court's denial of plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Haskell v. Harris</i>, 669 F.3d 1049, 1051 (9th Cir. 2012)</a>. The majority applied a ""totality of the circumstances"" test, balancing arrestees' privacy interests against the government's need for their DNA samples. The court concluded that ""the Government's compelling interests far outweigh arrestees' privacy concerns,"" and affirmed on that basis. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Id.</i></a>

Judge William A. Fletcher filed a dissenting opinion, in which he analogized the collection of arrestees' DNA to taking their fingerprints. Judge Fletcher argued that because in the absence of a warrant or reasonable suspicion an arrestee's fingerprints may only be taken for identification purposes--and not solely for an investigative purpose--the same logic applied to the collection of an arrestee's DNA. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Id.</i> at 1066</a>. Judge Fletcher felt that this made Proposition 69 unconstitutional, rendering the majority's ""totality of the circumstances"" test irrelevant. <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Id.</i> at 1080</a>. However, he also noted that if he were to apply that test, he would find the ""strength of plaintiffs' privacy interests much stronger."" <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/PN-CA-0023-0005.pdf""><i>Id.</i></a>

After the Ninth Circuit panel affirmed the District Court's decision, the plaintiffs petitioned the Ninth Circuit to rehear the appeal en banc. On July 25, 2012, the Ninth Circuit granted rehearing en banc. <i>Haskell v. Harris</i>, 686 F.3d 1121 (9th Cir. 2012). After oral argument on the rehearing, the Ninth Circuit issued an order stating that it would not rule on the appeal until the U.S. Supreme Court decided a related issue in <i>Maryland v. King</i>. In that case, Maryland's DNA collection laws were being challenged.

In June 2013, the Supreme Court, by a vote of 5-4, held that Maryland's DNA collection laws were constitutional. The Ninth Circuit subsequently ordered both sides to submit supplemental briefs and scheduled additional oral argument for December 2013. <i>Haskell v. Harris</i>, 727 F.3d 916 (9th Cir. 2013).

On March 20, 2014, the en banc court affirmed the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction. In a per curiam opinion, the appeals court held that after <i>Maryland v. King</i>, California's DNA collection scheme was constitutional. Further, the appeals court declined the plaintiffs' request to enter a preliminary injunction applicable to only a smaller class consisting of individuals arrested for certain felonies not covered by <i>King</i>. <i>Haskell v. Harris</i>, 745 F.3d 1269 (9th Cir. 2014). 

On July 18, 2014, the plaintiffs filed a motion to create subclasses. Proposed subclass A would include all persons arrested on suspicion of a felony but never charged with a
crime. Proposed subclass B would include only persons arrested for non-serious, non-violent felonies who were not actually charged. 

On that same date, the state filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that because California's DNA collection law was materially indistinguishable from the Maryland law upheld in <i>King</i>, neither the plaintiffs nor any possible class fell outside the wide parameters of <i>King</i> and the case was therefore over. 

On December 3, 2014, however, the district court stayed the case pending final resolution of a similar challenge to California's DNA Act in state court. In April 2018, the California Supreme Court upheld the state's DNA Act under both federal and California law as to the felony arrestee in that case. <i>People v. Buza</i>, 4 Cal. 5th 658 (2018). 

On June 22, 2018, Judge Breyer granted the state's motion for judgment on the pleadings and entered judgment for the state. <i>Haskell v. Brown</i>, 317 F. Supp. 3d 1095 (N.D. Cal. 2018). The court rejected the plaintiffs' proposed ""rule"" that would allow law enforcement to seize samples from all felony arrestees, but that would prevent law enforcement from analyzing those samples until a prosecutor has filed charges. Further, the court rejected the plaintiffs' arguments distinguishing <i>King</i>. First, the court explained that the plaintiffs understated the state's interests in taking, analyzing, and retaining DNA from people who are not charged with any offense or are discharged for lack of probable cause. Specifically, the court held that the state has a significant interest in the identification of arrestees, in accurately assessing the danger an arrestee poses to the public, and in exoneration. Second, the court noted that the individual interest was no different than that in <i>King</i>. Thus, in weighing the state's significant interest against the individual's modest interest, the court deemed the searches reasonable. Finally, the plaintiffs attempted to distinguish <i>King</i> based on three differences between the California and Maryland laws:  (1)
arrestee DNA samples are analyzed before arraignment in California; (2) more crimes
qualify for mandatory DNA analysis in California; (3) records and samples are not
automatically expunged in California. The court held that none of these three differences were constitutionally significant.

This document, titled ""Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief,"" is a legal filing brought by Aakash Desai, Reginald Ento, Elizabeth Aida Haskell, and Jeffrey Patrick Lyons Jr. as plaintiffs against Katharine Chao, Kamala D. Harris, Eva Steinberger, and DNA Saves as defendants. The plaintiffs, who have been arrested for various offenses, allege that the defendants violated their rights under the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution by collecting and storing their DNA without their consent. They seek damages and an injunction to prevent further violation of their rights. The plaintiffs are represented by attorneys Michael T. Risher and Shilpi Agarwal, while the defendants are represented by Enid Camps.

The court proceedings for this case began on December 6, 2010 and went through several stages, including a case management conference, a motion hearing, and a request for judicial notice. The defendants filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, arguing that the plaintiffs did not have standing to bring the lawsuit. After a hearing on the matter, the court ruled in favor of the defendants and entered a judgment against the plaintiffs.

They alleged that the defendants had violated 42 U.S.C. § 1983, the Americans with Disabilities Act, the Medicaid Act, and the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  Specifically they claimed that the defendants provided community-based treatment to individuals with disabilities authorized as waiver services in a way that prevented disabled individuals from receiving these services in a reasonably prompt manner.  They sought declaratory and injunctive relief.

On April 24, 2000 the district court (Judge Martha Alicia Vazquez) granted in part and denied in part the defendants' motion to dismiss.  The defendants appealed the ruling denying their sovereign immunity claims but on August 16, 2001 the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals (Judges Tacha, Pulitz, and Lucero) affirmed the district court.  On November 5, 2002 the district court granted the defendants summary judgment as to claims by plaintiffs who had since received the desired services or were deceased but denied the defendants' motion to dismiss the claim of the advocacy organization for lack of standing.  

Discovery proceeded until the district court (Judge Vazquez) granted the plaintiffs summary judgment on two counts and the defendants summary judgment on one count on August 5, 2003.

This document, titled ""Plaintiffs' Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief,"" is a legal complaint filed by a group of individuals with disabilities and their legal guardians and advocates against the New Mexico Department of Health, Department of Human Services, and Governor Gary Johnson. The plaintiffs, represented by The Arc of New Mexico and their respective parents, are alleging violations of their rights under the Medicaid Act, Americans with Disabilities Act, and Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.

The plaintiffs claim that the defendants have failed to provide necessary services in a timely manner, specifically through the Medicaid Home and Community-Based Services Waiver programs. They argue that these failures have led to a lack of available services and funding, resulting in delays and denials of services for eligible individuals. The plaintiffs also seek services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, as required by federal law.

The defendants, including Alex Valdez as the Secretary of both departments, are responsible for implementing and funding these programs and ensuring compliance with federal laws. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants' actions have violated their due process rights and seek declaratory and injunctive relief to remedy these violations and protect their rights.

PC-UT-0003,"On December 18, 1989, Sandra Henry filed a class action lawsuit under 42 U.S.C &sect; 1983 in the United States District Court for the District of Utah against the Utah Department of Corrections.  Henry brought the lawsuit on behalf of herself and current and future inmates at the Utah State Penitentiary at Draper.  Plaintiffs were represented by the Legal Center for the Handicapped, the ACLU of Utah Foundation, and private attorneys.  The National Prison Project of the ACLU later represented plaintiffs.  The lawsuit was seeking injunctive relief ordering defendant to take steps to improve medical and mental health care provided at the prison.  The plaintiffs alleged that the prison failed to employ enough physicians, dentists, psychiatrists, and nurses to provide care to inmates, leaving inmates with unmet medical needs.  For example, Henry was an HIV positive inmate who was denied AZT despite federal guidelines mandating the treatment.  Inmates were required to use a lengthy grievance procedure, which could last up to 70 days, when their medical needs were unmet, even when their conditions were serious or potentially life threatening.  Inmates with severe mental health disorders were often housed in the general population.

The parties agreed on a settlement of the mental health claims on September 8, 1992.  In April of 1993, the court (Chief Judge Bruce S. Jenkins) approved the settlement and retained jurisdiction to enforce the terms of the settlement.  Prison officials agreed to employ an adequate number of mental health professionals, to screen all inmates entering the prison system for signs of mental illness, and provide individualized treatment plans to inmates.  All inmates would receive information regarding mental health services available at the prison.  The settlement agreement also covered training of staff, crisis intervention procedures, and procedures for administering psychotropic medications.  Defendants were given two years to comply with these provisions.  

On January 23, 1993, the parties executed a settlement of the medical and dental claims.  A final order approving this settlement was entered on June 1, 1993 by Judge Jenkins.  Defendants agreed to ensure that inmates had access to a health care program equivalent to that within the community.  A Bureau of Medical Services, under the direction of physicians, was given authority to implement the changes within the prison system.  Defendants agreed to create a Continuous Quality Improvement Committee to assure compliance with the policies and procedures outlined in the settlement agreement and to oversee all contracts awarded to outside health care providers. Specific provisions of the settlement agreement included screening all incoming inmates for chronic conditions, communicable diseases, and dental problems, providing inmates with periodic health reviews, providing an adequate number of infirmary beds, and providing inmates with daily access to a licensed health care professional. Defendants were given two years to comply with these provisions.  

The docket indicates that the case was closed on June 24, 1993 and litigation continued through 2000 regarding attorneys' fees.

This document, titled ""Summary of Proceedings and Orders in Case between EEOC v.

The EEOC, as the plaintiff, filed the case on January 9, 2003, alleging that BDM engaged in discriminatory hiring practices against African-American job applicants, in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The EEOC is an agency of the United States of America and is authorized to litigate this action. BDM, a corporation based in San Diego, California, was the defendant in this case and was accused of discriminating against African-American applicants by favoring non-minority applicants in their hiring process.

IM-NY-0007,"<i>Turkmen v. Ashcroft</i>, also known as <i>Ziglar v. Abbasi</i>, is one of two related actions filed in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of New York by plaintiffs who were investigated and detained for suspected terrorist ties in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. It was filed on April 17, 2002 as a class-action lawsuit, but the class was never certified.  The case was assigned to Judge John Gleeson. (The related case, <i>Elmaghraby v. Ashcroft</i> (later <i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i>), was also assigned to Judge Gleeson, and was settled following the Supreme Court's ruling in that case, 556 U.S. 662.)  This case was reassigned to Judge Dora Irizarry on March 9, 2016, when Judge Gleeson resigned from the bench to return to private practice.

The plaintiffs in this case were men of Middle Eastern and South Asian descent who were arrested by the FBI and the INS in immigration raids following the September 11 attacks.  They were held for months in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn as the FBI investigated potential links to terrorism, but they were never charged with a crime.  Some of the plaintiffs alleged that they were kept in solitary confinement, barred from communication with attorneys, family, and friends, subjected to physical and verbal abuse, and obstructed in their efforts to practice their religion.  They sued the U.S. Attorney General, the FBI Director, the INS Commissioner, and employees of the Metropolitan Detention Center, alleging violations of the First, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Amendments, international human rights law, the Civil Rights Act, and the Alien Tort Statute, seeking compensatory and punitive damages.

Factually, the plaintiffs alleged that notices to appear in court were delayed in reaching them, that they were subject to a blanket no-bond policy, and that they were arbitrarily classified as ""of high interest.""  They claimed that they were subjected to strip searches, sleep deprivation, effective denial of exercise, denial of hygiene items and adequate food, inadequate medical attention, deliberate interference with religious rights, communications blackouts, interference with access to counsel, and denial of consular rights. The plaintiffs further alleged that they were subjected to these harsh conditions because of their religion or ethnicity, and that their continued detention under these conditions stemmed from a discriminatory policy created by high-level officials in the Bush Administration.

The plaintiffs later amended their complaint in light of reports published by the Office of the Inspector General in April and December 2003.  The amended complaints added new allegations, claims under the Federal Tort Claims Act, one additional plaintiff, and 28 Metropolitan Detention Center employees as defendants.

Four plaintiffs who had been deported were paroled into the U.S. for deposition. This was the first time that non-citizens barred from re-entering the U.S. were allowed to enter for the purpose of pursuing a civil case. While in the country they were under the strict custody of the U.S. Marshals Service.

In 2007, the Department of Justice indicted eleven current and former Metropolitan Detention Center employees, including three <i>Turkmen</i> defendants. Ten of the eleven were convicted of physical attacks against detainees at the Center; those convictions did not involve attacks against the plaintiffs in this case.

Following the 2009 Supreme Court ruling in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=9788""><i>Ashcroft v. Iqbal</i></a>, six of the plaintiffs settled their claims for $1.26 million. The remaining plaintiffs filed a fourth amended complaint on September 13, 2010, adding six new plaintiffs and attempting to meet the pleading standard set in <i>Iqbal</i>, so as to maintain claims against Ashcroft and other high-ranking officials.  

On January 15, 2013, the district court dismissed all claims against the Attorney General, the FBI Director, and the INS Commissioner (the ""DOJ defendants""), and also dismissed two of the claims against the Metropolitan Detention Center employees (the ""MDC defendants"").  Those two claims, based on alleged communications blackouts and interference with counsel, were dismissed on the grounds of qualified immunity.

The plaintiffs collectively and the MDC defendants individually appealed the ruling to the Second Circuit. The appeals were consolidated as Case No. 13-1662; the consolidated appeal was heard on May 1, 2014.  More than a year later, on June 17, 2015, the appeals court reinstated the plaintiffs' claims under the Due Process Clause, the Equal Protection Clause, the Fourth Amendment, and 42 U.S.C. §1985, against the DOJ defendants and the MDC defendants.  The court upheld the dismissal, however, of the plaintiffs' claims under the Free Exercise Clause.

In reinstating the claims against the Attorney General and the FBI Director for their post-September 11 policy decisions, the court was extending the application of <i>Bivens</i> into ""a context not previously recognized by the Supreme Court or Second Circuit precedent.""  789 F.3d 218 (2d Cir. 2015).  It was also an innovation for the court to hold that officials were not protected by qualified immunity for punitive and discriminatory confinement and unreasonable strip searches that they imposed on detainees after learning that those detainees were being held with no individualized suspicion of terrorist connections.

The defendants' petition for rehearing en banc was denied; they subsequently sought a 90-day stay of the mandate while the Solicitor General determined whether to appeal to the Supreme Court. The appeals court granted the stay, and the Supreme Court ultimately heard the appeal and issued a decision on June 19, 2017.  Titling the case <i>Ziglar v. Abbasi</i>, the Supreme Court held that the Second Circuit should not have extended <i>Bivens</i> liability to the DOJ defendants, emphasizing that ""Congress, not the courts, should decide whether a damages action should be allowed.""  137 S.Ct. 1843.  It held that the plaintiffs' abuse allegations against the MDC defendants did state a plausible claim for relief under the Fifth Amendment, and remanded to the Second Circuit to determine whether a <i>Bivens</i> damages remedy would be appropriate.  Finally, the Court dismissed the 42 U.S.C. §1985 conspiracy claims, ruling that the defendants were entitled to qualified immunity.

The Second Circuit remanded the case to the district court for additional proceedings. On February 27, 2018, the district court dismissed the plaintiffs' claims against the DOJ defendants and referred the remainder of their claims to a magistrate judge.  In light of the Supreme Court's ruling, the remaining (MDC) defendants moved to dismiss the case for failure to state a claim.

On August 13, 2018, the magistrate judge issued a report, recommending that the plaintiffs' claims against the MDC defendants be dismissed.  The magistrate judge concluded that Congress was in ""the best position to weight the costs and benefits of allowing a [<i>Bivens</i>] cause of action to proceed"" in the context of prisoner abuse claims such as those brought in this case.

The plaintiffs have since filed objections to the report.  As of July 2, 2020, the report and the plaintiffs' objections to it are pending before the district court.","

This comprehensive document, titled Turkmen v. Ashcroft, covers a class action lawsuit brought by eight male non-citizens against government officials and personnel responsible for their detention at the Metropolitan Detention Center (MDC) in Brooklyn, New York after the September 11th terrorist attacks. The plaintiffs, including Ahmer Abbasi, Purna Bajracharya, Benamar Benatta, Saeed Hammouda, Ahmed Khalifa, Anser Mehmood, Dennis Hasty, and Salvatore LoPresti, were represented by attorneys from the Center for Constitutional Rights, the American Civil Liberties Union, and the law firm of Milberg Weiss. They alleged that they were specifically targeted and mistreated based on their race, religion, and national origin, and subjected to harsh conditions of confinement, physical and verbal abuse, and denial of their constitutional rights. The defendants included high-ranking government officials, such as former Attorney General John Ashcroft and former FBI Director Robert Mueller, as well as lower-ranking MDC officials, including former warden James Hasty. The plaintiffs sought damages and a judgment declaring the defendants' actions unconstitutional and unlawful.

The complaint alleged that the defendant violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 when it discriminated against female employees by maintaining a sexually hostile work environment where they were subjected to verbal and physical acts of sexual harassment.  Two months after the initial complaint was filed, the parties consented to proceed before a magistrate judge and settled the case.  A consent decree was entered in November 2006.  

In the consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would refrain from retaliating and discriminating based on sex, pay the aggrieved women $230,000, distribute its anti-harassment policy, post an EEO notice, implement complaint procedures, provide all new managers and staff with EEO training, inform all its managers and supervisors of their duty to enforce policy, expunge complainants' employee records, and issue neutral references. No costs or fees were awarded. The terms of the decree were for two years, and ended on November 20, 2008.

The EEOC filed a complaint on September 29, 2006, alleging that First Watch had created a hostile work environment for female employees at their restaurant in Burlingame, California. The complaint detailed various instances of sexual harassment and discrimination, including unwelcome sexual comments and physical touching by a male supervisor, as well as offensive and derogatory comments made by other male employees. These practices were found to have interfered with the female employees' work performance and created unequal employment opportunities.

The plaintiffs, represented by private counsel, asked the court for both monetary damages and injunctive relief, alleging the defendant engaged in race discrimination in terms of hiring, retention, promotion, pay, resource allocation and more. 

The plaintiffs filed their first amended complaint on July 19, 2006.

On November 8, 2008 the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification. On August 9, 2010, the District Court (Judge Robert W. Gettleman) issued an amended order denying the plaintiffs' motion for class certification on the ground that commonality was not satisfied because the putative class members were supervised by hundreds of different people and had a wide variety of salary levels and positions. 2010 WL 3087483. 

On February 14, 2011, Judge Gettleman denied the plaintiffs' motion for reconsideration for class certification and their request to narrow the class definition. Judge Gettleman held that the plaintiffs' disparate impact claim was not sufficient to satisfy the commonality requirement for class certification and that their class as proposed failed to satisfy either category of class certification because the individual questions of law and claims to relief predominated over those of the class. 2011 WL 658155.

The plaintiffs appealed this decision to the U.S Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. (Judges Richard Posner, Diane Wood, and David Hamilton), which denied the request based on an untimely appeal. 

The plaintiffs filed an amended motion for class certification in July 2011, shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court decided Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes.  Judge Gettlman denied their motion on September 19, 2011, once again on commonality grounds. 2011 WL 4471028.

The employees filed an interlocutory appeal to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. On February 24, 2012, the Seventh Circuit (Judges Posner, Wood, and Hamilton) reversed the District Court decision. The Circuit Court held that the issue of whether Merrill Lynch's policies had a disparate impact on African-American employees was appropriate for class-wide treatment because each of the plaintiffs' claims had the common question of whether Merrill Lynch ""violated the antidiscrimination statutes."" 672 F.3d 482. 

Merrill Lynch's motion for rehearing en banc was denied by the Seventh Circuit on March 27, 2012.  Its subsequent appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court was denied on October 1, 2012.

On July 13, 2012, the District Court issued certification of the disparate impact class, according to the Seventh Circuit's order.  

On December 6, 2013, the District Court (Judge Gettleman) approved a settlement agreement on all claims proposed by the parties. Pursuant to the agreement, Merrill Lynch would allocate $160 million in a settlement fund, $25 million of which would be designated for extraordinary claims. The District Court also approved service awards of $250,000 for each Class Representative and $75,000 for each member of the Steering Committee. In regards to attorney's fees, the District Court approved the plaintiff's requested attorney's fees of 21.25% (20% of the first 100 million of the settlement fund and 15% of the remainder). The programmatic relief granted by the settlement consisted of several changes to company policies, including changes to the distribution of accounts, as well as the establishment of coaching for African American financial advisors and a diversity fund to assist African Americans in funding business development events. This portion of the settlement lasted for 3 years. 

On December 16, 2014, a named plaintiff filed a motion to appeal the District Court's final approval of the class action settlement, but the Seventh Circuit (Diane P. Wood, Richard D. Cudahy, and Diane S. Sykes) denied the appeal based on an untimely request.

This document is a compilation of individual summaries from various segments of a legal case involving a class action lawsuit against Merrill Lynch for alleged discriminatory practices in their employment policies and practices. The case, McReynolds v. Merrill Lynch, was filed in November 2005 in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from Stowell & Friedman, Ltd., filed a lawsuit against Merrill Lynch, a financial firm with over 15,000 employees, for their discriminatory treatment of African-American employees. The plaintiffs alleged that the company's policies and practices resulted in unequal opportunities for advancement and compensation for African-American employees, and created a hostile work environment. They sought class certification to represent all African-American employees who have worked for Merrill Lynch since August 23, 2001, as well as financial and injunctive relief.

The class consisted of all juveniles who were or would be confined in the correctional facilities of the defendant. The South Carolina Protection and Advocacy System for the Handicapped and private counsel represented the class. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief along with damages, alleging that the conditions at the correctional facilities deprived juveniles of various statutory rights and violated the constitutional guarantees due process, equal protection, and freedom from cruel and unusual punishment.

The juvenile institutions in question were overcrowded, lacked adequate staffing, and lacked adequate fire safety. The correctional facilities were in disrepair, the disciplinary policies were implemented without regard to their psychological effect on the juveniles, and the juveniles were classified only by size and sex. Medical and mental health services were insufficient for the population of the facilities. Telephone communication, visitation, and access to courts and attorneys were all restricted. The Department of Juvenile Justice failed to provide a vocational education and any special education. 

On January 25, 1995, the District Court (Judge Joseph F. Anderson, Jr.) required the Department of Juvenile Justice to submit a remedial plan to the court within 120 days. The court held (1) that the conditions at the juvenile institutions violated the due process guarantee of the Fourteenth Amendment, (2) that the juveniles had a constitutional right to personal safety, (3) that the juveniles had a constitutional right to medical services, (4) that the juveniles had a constitutional right to minimally adequate program services to teach principles essential to correcting conduct, (5) that the requirements of the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act and the requirements of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 applied to juvenile correctional facilities, and (6) that states were given the opportunity in the first instance to correct the deficiencies.

VR-DC-1168,"On July 19, 2011, the state of Texas filed suit against the United States in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia under Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act. The state asked for a declaratory judgment, alleging that the Department of Justice inappropriately declared Texas's new districting plan to be retrogressive (that is, discriminatory, because it diluted minority voting power). Arguments focused primarily on the demographics of the state of Texas and its new districting map. On November 8, 2011, the District Court (Judge Thomas Griffith) denied Texas's motion for summary judgment, holding that Texas improperly relied solely on demographic data in formulating its plans and that there were genuine issues of material fact. 831 F. Supp. 2d 244. 

On August 28, 2012, the District Court held that Texas had not met its burden of showing that the new U.S. Congressional and State House plans were not retrogressive or its burden of proving that its U.S. Congressional and State Senate plans were not enacted with a discriminatory purpose, and therefore denied declaratory judgment. 887 F. Supp. 2d 133. Texas sought review in the Supreme Court, and the case was held while the constitutionality of the Voting Rights Act was under review in <I>Shelby County v. Holder</I>. 

On June 25, 2013, the Supreme Court held in the <I>Shelby County</I> case that the Voting Rights Act was unconstitutional in part, striking down Section 4 of the Act, the ""coverage"" provision, which controlled which jurisdictions were obligated to seek DOJ preclearance of voting-related changes. 570 U.S. 529. The next day, the Court vacated the opinion in this case and remanded the case to the District Court for the District of Columbia. 570 U.S. 928.

On July 3, 2013, Texas moved to dismiss as moot all claims brought in its original complaint. It advanced two arguments in support of dismissal. First, on June 23, 2013, while Texas's appeal was pending and before the Supreme Court had announced its decision in <i>Shelby County</i>, the Texas legislature adopted a new set of redistricting plans that replaced those challenged in this case. Second, <i>Shelby County</i> (which held the VRA's coverage formula unconstitutional) had removed Texas from the preclearance regime of Section 5. Texas argued that these two factors had mooted it claims. On December 3, 2013, a three-judge panel for the District Court for the District of Columbia (Judge Thomas B. Griffith writing for the Court) agreed that the controversy had been mooted, and dismissed all claims. <a href=""http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/VR-DC-1168-0012.pdf"">Mem. & Order, Dec. 3, 2013</a>. 

On December 17, 2013, several parties (individual voters, elected state representatives, and civil rights advocacy groups) who had intervened as defendants earlier in the litigation moved for attorney fees and costs totaling $1,096,770.01. The intervenors argued that they were prevailing parties and thus entitled to fees and costs under the VRA-specifically, under § 1973l(e) of the VRA, 42 U.S.C. § 1973l(e), and subsection (b) of 42 U.S.C. § 1988. These sections allow courts to, at their discretion, award the prevailing party reasonable fees and costs if the underlying action was to enforce the voting guarantees of the Fourteenth or Fifteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution.

On June 18, 2014, the District Court (Judge Rosemary M. Collyer) granted the intervenors' motion for attorney fees and costs in full. <a href=""http://clearinghouse.net/chDocs/public/VR-DC-1168-0013.pdf""><i>Texas v. United States</i>, Civil Action No. 11-1303 (RMC), 2014 WL 2758597, at *11 (D.D.C. June 18, 2014)</a>. Describing the issue as a ""case study in how not to respond to a motion for attorney fees and costs,"" <i>id.</i> at *1, Judge Rosemary chastised Texas for failing to respond (other than by means of a three-page ""Advisory"" filing) to the intervenors' motion. Finding that Texas's ""Advisory"" filing presented no substantive legal opposition, the Court thus granted the motion.

On July 16, 2014, Texas appealed the order granting attorney fees to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. The June 18 order was stayed pending this appeal. 

On August 18, 2015, the Judge Patricia A. Millett of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit issued an opinion affirming the District Court’s fee award. Judge Millett found that Texas failed to follow the District Court’s rules for responding to motions for attorneys’ fees and did not challenge the District Court’s use of its rules on appeal. Judge Millett proceeded to identify numerous flaws in Texas’ argument that the Supreme Court’s decision in <i>Shelby County</i> made the intervenors ineligible for attorneys’ fees. Concluding that “Texas gets no second bite at the apple now” after its procedural missteps, Judge Millett affirmed the District Court’s fee award. 798 F.3d 1108. 

After the Court of Appeals issued its opinion, the intervenors moved for additional attorneys’ fees to cover the costs of appeal, and Texas failed to secure Supreme Court review. 136 S. Ct. 981. On March 17, 2016, the Court of Appeals remanded the intervenor’s motion for additional attorneys’ fees, now augmented by the costs of opposing Supreme Court review, to the District Court for fact-finding.

After almost a year of litigation over the additional attorneys’ fees, Judge Collyer issued an order and opinion granting the intervenors most of their requested fees on March 30, 2017. Judge Collyer noted that prevailing parties challenging voting plans or procedures are entitled to attorneys’ fees under 42 U.S.C. § 1988(b). The parties disputed whether undetermined fees should be calculated using the intervenors’ attorneys’ rates from private practice or the more conservative Laffey Matrix, a “commonly used” tool in the D.C. Circuit. Judge Collyer selected a generous form of the Laffey Matrix as most appropriate given the skill of the intervenors’ attorneys and the complexity of the litigation but reduced one fee award by 7.6 hours for work on a motion that was never filed. 

The case is now closed. ","

This case, officially titled as a civil rights class action lawsuit against Wackenhut Corrections Corporation and several other defendants, was brought forth by a group of plaintiffs, including minors represented by a Guardian ad Litem and a Tutor. The plaintiffs alleged that they had been subjected to abusive and inhumane conditions at the Jena Juvenile Justice Center in Louisiana, including excessive force, inadequate medical and mental health care, and unsafe living conditions. They argued that these conditions violated their rights under various constitutional amendments and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The defendants named in the lawsuit included the Governor of Louisiana, the Secretary of the Department of Public Safety and Corrections, and Wackenhut Corrections Corporation. The plaintiffs were seeking legal action to address the violations of their rights and requested various forms of relief, including monetary damages, injunctive relief, and the appointment of a special officer to oversee necessary changes.

IM-NY-0060,"On Jan. 25, 2018, the National Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild (NIPNLG) and a law professor brought this Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) suit against the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and its component U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), as well as the U.S. Department of State (DOS). The plaintiffs sought to shed light on the government's decision to terminate Temporary Protected Status (TPS) for Haitian nationals, including its justification and legality. This case was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and assigned to Judge Ronnie Abrams on Jan. 29, 2018.

NIPNLG is a nonprofit organization that provides legal assistance to immigrants and advocacy on behalf of noncitizens. The other plaintiff is a professor at the New York University School of Law, where she works on human rights issues and in particular Haiti and Haitian immigrants in the United States.

The plaintiffs sought records related to the government's determination to terminate TPS for Haitian nationals. The plaintiffs argued that ""[t]imely disclosure of these records is critically important because of the looming termination of legal immigration status for tens of thousands of Haitian nationals living in the United States."" The complaint explained that TPS status protected foreign nationals from deportation and allowed them to access work authorization. To get TPS, the individual's country of origin must be designated as warranting TPS and the individual must apply and be approved for the status. The plaintiffs argued that the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) required a factual inquiry to terminate TPS for a particular country after the designation had been granted; it could not be terminated without reason. According to the complaint, DHS most recently designated Haiti for TPS in 2015 and then extended the designation by six months in May 2017 in light of extensive hurricane damage. DHS terminated TPS for Haiti on Nov. 20, 2017—according to the plaintiffs, without justification—leaving 58,000 Haitian nationals in the U.S. at the risk of deportation and loss of work authorization.

On Feb. 15, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, noting that DOS had issued a travel warning for Haiti. The plaintiffs also added as a defendant U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), which they alleged had not substantively responded to a Nov. 2017 FOIA request.

On March 16, 2018, the defendants wrote to the Court arguing that the plaintiffs did not qualify for expedited processing and that plaintiffs' proposed production schedule was not practicable. The defendants requested additional time to process. On Mar. 23, 2018, the plaintiffs opposed this request.

By April 4, 2018 the parties had agreed on a proposed briefing schedule, which Judge Abrams approved, specifying that each agency was required to produce 1500 pages monthly of the requested documents. The defendants moved for summary judgment on April 27, 2018, and the plaintiffs moved for summary judgement on May 18, 2018.

While the court considered the motions, similar cases involving the termination of Haiti's TPS were litigated, most notably Ramos v. Nielsen, et al., 3:18-cv-01554 (N.D. Cal.) and Saget v. Trump, et al., 1:18-cv-01599 (E.D.N.Y.). The documents submitted for discovery in these cases were re-released to the plaintiffs in this case. These releases occurred on March 27, 2019 and April 10, 2019.

Following the release of this additional information, and due to parallel injunctive litigation, the plaintiffs agreed to voluntarily dismiss their case on April 23, 2019. This case is now closed.","

The document in question is a court filing discussing a motion for expedited processing filed by the plaintiffs in case 18-cv-00659-RA. The plaintiffs, represented by the Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC), have filed a lawsuit against the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) for alleged violations of the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). The plaintiffs, who are a non-profit organization focused on privacy and civil liberties issues, claim that the FBI has failed to respond in a timely manner to their requests for information related to the collection of data from social media platforms. They argue that this information is crucial to their case and have requested expedited processing of their FOIA requests. The defendants, represented by the Department of Justice, have opposed the motion, stating that the FBI has been handling the requests within a reasonable timeframe and that expedited processing is not necessary. The plaintiffs allege that the FBI's collection of data from social media platforms violates the privacy rights of individuals and that the agency has not been transparent about their data collection practices. They are seeking an order from the court to require the FBI to produce the requested records. The attorneys involved in this case include those from EPIC and the Department of Justice.

The complaint, filed in August 2006, alleged age discrimination in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act; specifically that Defendant had discharged the charging party based on his age (60).  In April 2007, the parties proposed a consent decree and it was signed two weeks later. 

The decree, valid for 2 years, required Defendant to pay charging party a total of 18,977.20 ($6,560.40 in back pay, $2,928.20 as a benefit contribution and $9,488.60 in liquidated damages).  Defendant was enjoined from discriminating, and required to provide annual EEO training to employees, post a notice of non-discrimination at its facility, distribute an EEO policy sheet to its employees, discipline any managers who discriminate and report to the EEOC annually on its compliance with the decree. Defendant was also required to provide neutral references for the charging party if asked by another employer. The terms of the agreement were to run for 2 years.

This document, titled ""Complaint against Howard S Wright Construction Company,"" was filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) in 2006. The plaintiffs in this case were the EEOC and Cecil Cheeka, a 60-year-old journeyman ironworker who was employed by Howard S. Wright Construction Company (HSWCC) until he was terminated in 2011. The EEOC alleged that HSWCC had violated the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA) by terminating Mr. Cheeka's employment due to his age and replacing him with younger, less experienced workers. The EEOC sought a permanent injunction against HSWCC to prevent further discriminatory practices and monetary relief for Mr. Cheeka. The attorneys involved were John Freeman Stanley for the EEOC and Paul Milton Nordsletten for HSWCC. The court issued a summons to HSWCC in 2006 and the company was served in 2006. HSWCC filed an answer to the complaint in 2006 and the case proceeded to court.

The EEOC alleged that defendant had engaged in hiring discrimination based on national origin and religion when it did not hire an Indian Sikh.  The defendant, a nationwide provider of fitness centers and fitness training, and the EEOC attempted to resolve the dispute through mediation for nearly three months but were unsuccessful.  Upon their return to court, the parties postponed a firm scheduling order until, four months later, they came to an agreement and a consent decree was approved in April 2007 that ordered the defendant to pay $24,000 to the complainant, enjoined it from discriminating on the basis of national origin and religion, and required it to provide equal employment opportunity training sessions to its supervisory employees.

The EEOC sought back pay, lost wages and benefits, compensatory and punitive damages, and injunctive relief for Charging Party and other aggrieved individuals. The case was assigned to United States Magistrate Judge James Larson, and later reassigned to Magistrate Judge Elizabeth D. Laporte.

PN-NJ-0005,"Plaintiff, the editor of a local newspaper, filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court of Massachusetts against the Newark Police Department on January 23, 2008 under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 and N.J.S.A. 10:6-1. Plaintiff, represented by attorneys from Seton Hall University School of Law and the ACLU of New Jersey, sought damages, alleging that police officers violated his First Amendment right to receive and record information for later dissemination, Fourth Amendment right to be free from unlawful searches and seizures, corresponding provisions in the New Jersey State Constitution, and the New Jersey Reporter Shield Law. Specifically, plaintiff's allegations revolved around an August 4, 2007 incident in which Newark Police Department officers confiscated a photographer's camera and detained plaintiff under threat of arrest until he agreed to turn over all copies of photographs related to a murder in a rash of violence in the city described as an embarrassment to local law enforcement.

On December 23, 2009, plaintiff petitioned for judgment after agreeing with the Newark Police Department to settle the case in the amount of $55,000. On the same day, plaintiff also filed a Request to File an Application for Attorneys' Fees. In entering judgment on February 22, 2010, the District Court (Judge Faith S. Hochberg) granted the judgment in the amount of $55,000 and denied plaintiff's request for attorneys' fees on the grounds that the settlement agreement included all attorneys' fees.

Plaintiff appealed that decision to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals on March 9, 2010. On July 19, 2011, the Court of Appeals (Judge Thomas M. Hardiman) reversed the District Court and held that, since the offer of settlement did not explicitly reference the inclusion of fees, attorneys' fees were not included in the settlement. The case was remanded to the District Court to determine reasonable attorneys' fees pursuant to 42 U.S.C. § 1988.

On October 13, 2011, the parties settled the remaining attorneys' fees claim. On October 24, 2011, the District Court (Judge Faith S. Hochberg) ordered the case closed. Plaintiff entered a notice that the judgment of $55,000, and additional attorneys' fees, had been paid in full on October 23, 2012. ","

This document is a comprehensive summary of the legal case filed by Roberto Lima against the Newark Police Department and its employees, including defendants Garry McCarthy, Samuel DeMaio, and Lydell James. The case, docketed as 2:08-cv-00426-FSH-PS, was overseen by Judge Faith S. Hochberg and Magistrate Judge Patty Shwartz.

The case, filed on January 26, 2009, involves allegations of misconduct by the Newark Police Department and its employees. The plaintiff, Roberto Lima, is a journalist for the Brazilian Voice newspaper in Newark, New Jersey, and is represented by lawyers from Seton Hall University School of Law Center for Social Justice and the American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey. The defendants in this case include the Newark Police Department (NPD), its Director Garry McCarthy and Deputy Chief Samuel Demaio, and employees of the NPD and the Essex County Prosecutor's Office. The lawsuit alleges a violation of Mr. Lima's constitutional rights, specifically his First Amendment rights to freedom of speech, expression, and the press, as well as his Fourth and Seventh Amendment rights to be free from unlawful searches and seizures.

IM-GA-0008,"On January 30, 2017, a lawful permanent resident (LPR) of the United States, represented by private counsel, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Georgia. The complaint alleged that the plaintiff was held for questioning at Atlanta International Airport as he was trying to return to his home to Atlanta, solely due to the Executive Order issued by President Donald Trump on January 27, 2017 suspending entry into the United States of nationals of Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. The complaint further alleged that the defendants, in denying an LPR re-entry after a brief visit abroad, violated Fifth Amendment procedural due process rights, the Immigration and Nationality Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The complaint was filed as a petition for mandamus (directing inspection of returning LPRs under the INA rather than under the Executive Order) and a civil complaint seeking declaratory and injunctive relief. 

The plaintiff was an Iraqi refugee who has worked for CNN since 2004 and currently is an International Desk Producer. He was based at CNN's Atlanta bureau and travels to the Middle East regularly for his reporting work. On January 29, 2017, after returning to the US from a trip to Iraq, he was detained and questioned at Atlanta International Airport, before being released. Represented by private counsel, the plaintiff alleged that he was therefore uncertain whether he may leave and re-enter the United States in the future, and that this is a substantial problem, because he travels often for his work.

The case was assigned to Judge Timothy Batten.  On February 1, the plaintiff filed an emergency motion to expedite proceedings, arguing that the issues raised in the complaint are of immediate importance and could evade review if not expedited. On February 2, the court ordered the defendants to respond by February 8 to the plaintiff's emergency motion. On February 7, the government filed a motion to dismiss and on February 8 they filed a response in opposition to the plaintiff's emergency motion. On February 9, the plaintiffs filed an answer to the government's response, and on February 10 Judge Batten denied the motion to expedite proceedings. 

On February 17, the plaintiffs filed a motion to extend the response timeline to the government's motion to dismiss. On February 21, Judge Batten granted plaintiffs' motion for an extension through February 28.

On Feb. 27, the plaintiffs filed a response to the government's motion to dismiss the complaint as moot. The plaintiffs argued that executive documents issued to clarify the EO do not change the clear text of the EO, which is still binding and still purports to exclude all ""immigrants"" - including LPRs like the named plaintiff - despite the government's clarifying documents indicating otherwise. The plaintiffs further argued that, as the EO remains in effect and the defendants have therefore not yet established full voluntary cessation of their conduct, the EO falls under a mootness exception for conduct ""capable of repetition yet evading review."" 

Prompted by adverse developments in the Ninth Circuit in <a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15606"">Washington v. Trump</a>, another litigation challenging the Executive Order, on Mar. 6, 2017, the President rescinded the Jan. 27 Executive Order and replaced it with a narrower one, <a href=""https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2017/03/09/2017-04837/protecting-the-nation-from-foreign-terrorist-entry-into-the-united-states"">Executive Order 13780</a>.

On Mar. 9, the parties filed a joint motion to extend the reply and pretrial discovery timeline. The court granted this motion on Mar. 13. The parties now have until Mar. 23 to file a discovery plan and for the defendants to respond on their Feb. 7 motion to dismiss the complaint as moot. 

On Mar. 21, the parties filed a joint motion to extend the reply timeline. On Mar. 22, the court granted the motion, giving plaintiff through Mar. 23 to file an amended complaint and giving the government 30 days from the plaintiff's filing date to respond. The court additionally allowed the government to withdraw its Feb. 7 motion to dismiss the complaint. 

On Mar. 23, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint challenging Section 1(g) (which applied greater scrutiny to Iraqi nationals during the visa issuance/U.S. admissions process) and Section 4 (which provides that applications for visa/admissions/any immigration benefit by Iraqi nationals should be ""subjected to thorough review"") of the second EO. Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that no section of the EO removes Iraqi LPR's from the ""additional scrutiny"" and ""thorough review"" requirements, in violation of the INA, APA, and Fifth Amendment due process rights. The plaintiffs sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as a writ of mandamus instructing DHS to instruct its employees inspecting aliens at U.S. points of entry to exclude returning Iraqi resident immigrants from the new screening terms under the EO. 

On Apr. 24, the government filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint.

The parties filed a joint preliminary report and discovery plan on July 7. Later in July, the parties noted their disagreement over the discovery deadlines, and discovery was stayed pending the district court's ruling on the Apr. 24 motion to dismiss. 

On Aug. 11, Judge Batten granted the defendants' Apr. 24 motion to dismiss the amended complaint, finding that Tawfeeq lacked standing to challenge sections 2 (which does not apply to Iraqi nationals such as Tawfeeq), 1(g) (which the plaintiffs acknowledge would only apply to Tawfeeq if erroneously implemented, and the court will not presume that the law would be erroneously implemented), and 4 (which the court determined was too speculative to grant standing). Finally, the court determined that the revocation of the January EO rendered moot Tawfeeq's claims challenging its application to lawful permanent residents.  

This case is now closed. ","

The document at hand, ""Case 1:17-cv-00353-TCB Document 37 Filed 05/08/17 Page 2 of 27,"" is a court filing in a lawsuit brought forth by plaintiff Mohammed Tawfeeq, a journalist and Iraqi national, against defendants President Donald Trump and his administration. Tawfeeq, a lawful permanent resident (LPR) in the United States, is challenging the legality of President Trump's Executive Orders (EO-1 and EO-2) which restrict travel and immigration from certain designated countries. Tawfeeq argues that, as an LPR, he is entitled to enhanced statutory and constitutional protections and should be treated as a ""returning resident"" when re-entering the United States. The defendants have filed a motion to dismiss the case, claiming lack of standing and mootness due to the revocation and replacement of the Executive Orders. However, Tawfeeq asserts that he remains at risk from a renewed Executive Order at any time, as the President has stated and demonstrated his intent to continue his Executive Order policy.

The suit was based on alleged discrimination of female applicants due to their age.  The hotel was not hiring qualified women to be waitresses at their restaurant because they were over 40 years of age.  There was very little action during the course of this suit.  Finally the case was resolved through a consent decree that was apparently reached through multiple conferences involving the parties.  This consent decree was entered in February of 2003.

The consent decree contained both monetary relief as well as injunctive relief.  The defendant was to pay $220,000 to an undisclosed class of women over 40 who had been adversely affected by the hiring practices of the hotel.  This class was to be determined by the EEOC.  For injunctive relief the consent decree required that the hotel train each of its supervisors, human resource people, and hiring personnel twice a year for the three year life of the consent decree.

This document, officially titled EEOC v. Beverly Holdings, Inc., d/b/a The Beverly Hilton Hotel, is a collection of court documents pertaining to a case filed by the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against The Beverly Hilton and other defendants for alleged violations of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act (ADEA). The complaint was filed on behalf of a 54-year-old woman and over 15 other similarly situated individuals who were denied employment at the Coconut Club restaurant within The Beverly Hilton due to their age.

The plaintiffs alleged that they were denied employment at the Coconut Club, which closed in July 2001, and subsequently replaced with a younger staff. The EEOC sought relief for the affected individuals, including a permanent injunction against the discriminatory practices, equal employment opportunities for individuals over 40, and financial compensation for lost pay and damages.

The James Madison Project (JMP) is an organization established in 1998 ""to promote government accountability and the reduction of secrecy, as well as [to educate] the public on issues relating to intelligence and national security."" Noah Schactman is the current Editor-in-Chief (previously the Executive Editor) of The Daily Beast, and Betsy Woodruff was a politics reporter for the publication at the time. Private counsel represented plaintiffs, who filed their complaint in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia.

Plaintiffs sought disclosure of agency records by DHS and its subordinate entities: the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP), and U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). Specifically, plaintiffs sought the disclosure of records clarifying the extent to which U.S. lawful permanent residents (LPRs) were coerced into surrendering their residency statuses, once DHS began implementing President Trump's Jan. 27 <a href=""https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/FR-2017-02-01/pdf/2017-02281.pdf"">Executive Order 13769</a> but before DHS stopped enforcing it on Feb. 4. According to plaintiffs, lawyers for some travelers affected by the EO claimed their clients were, during this implementation period, pressured to sign I-407 forms surrendering their LPR status.

The complaint alleged that on Mar. 3, 2017, plaintiffs submitted a FOIA request to the defendant federal agencies seeking copies of records memorializing:
1. Instructions or guidelines – including verbal instructions memorialized in writing – provided to CBP officials with respect to agency practice for presenting I-407 forms to individuals impacted by the EO;
2. Communications between CBP officials – including verbal communications memorialized in writing – mentioning I-407 forms between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5;  
3. Any documentation tabulating or calculating the number of individuals who signed I-407 forms between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5;  
4. Copies of the actual I-407 forms signed between Jan. 27 and Feb. 5.

The complaint further alleged that, to date, the plaintiffs had not received a substantive response from any of the defendant agencies, and that the plaintiffs had constructively exhausted all required administrative remedies. The plaintiffs sought a disclosure order under FOIA, legal fees, and expedited action.

(Plaintiff James Madison Project also has two similar FOIA cases in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, summarized in this Clearinghouse: one by the Daily Beast against the Department of Justice (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15676"">NS-DC-0106</a>) and one by Politico against DHS (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=15678"">NS-DC-0107</a>).

On June 29, the case was assigned to Judge James E. Boasberg.

On Sept. 7, the parties reported that USCIS and CBP were searching for records responsive to plaintiff's request and needed another month to prepare a list. On Oct. 10, the parties reported the following: TSA had located no responsive documents; USCIS had located no responsive records for some requests and had withheld responsive records for other requests due to privacy; and CBP had located a few responsive records.

Judge Boasberg then ordered defendant (USCIS and CBP) to provide its first production of non-exempt portions of responsive records by Nov. 6 and its second production by Dec. 7.

On Nov. 6, the parties reported that defendants were following the schedule ordered by Judge Boasberg. 

The following status report, of Jan. 5, 2018, noted that USCIS and CBP had both produced more responsive non-exempt records and informed plaintiff that the search was completed. The parties agreed to meet to confer on next steps.

The Feb. 1 status report stated that the parties needed more time to discuss search declarations, before deciding whether to brief motions. A status report filed on Apr. 13 informed the Court that plaintiffs accepted TSA's productions and the sufficiency of USCIS's and CBP's searches, but would challenge denials and redactions of some of USCIS's and CBP's productions. Status reports filed October through December indicated the production was ongoing. 

Though the documents released by the government are not available online, <a href=""https://www.thedailybeast.com/border-patrol-ordered-to-block-congressmen-during-travel-ban"">this news article</a> references some of their contents. 

On June 15, 2018, the defendants submitted a motion for summary judgment, arguing that the I-407 forms in question were exempt and properly withheld. The plaintiffs responded to the motion on July 16, claiming that the categorical refusal to produce the I-407 forms was improper and that their redactions were unjustified. After a conference call on October 3, the defendant submitted a status report on October 5, with the defendant’s agreement to respond to the plaintiff’s FOIA requests and a proposed schedule. The court, as agreed in the report, ordered the defendant to provide rolling productions every 60 days of the I-407 forms and a joint status report every 45 days.

Production followed the next few months. On December 26, 2018, the defendant moved for a stay of production schedule due to lapse of appropriations, which resulted in a temporary prohibition of DOJ’s work. Two days later, the court granted the motion. According to the February 1, 2019 status report, the funding was restored and the defendants had completed their required production on December 18, 2018. The parties then continued to provide status reports regarding attorney fees. 

On April 19, 2019, the plaintiffs submitted a stipulation of dismissal with prejudice, and the court ordered dismissal the same day. The case is now closed.   ","

IM-NY-0072,"COVID-19 Summary: This case was initially filed in February 2020 to address the absence of bond hearings for ICE detainees in New York. Then on March 16, 2020, in light of the grave threat posed by congregate detention during the coronavirus pandemic, plaintiffs sought emergency relief: individualized determinations assessing whether detention is necessary in light of flight risk/public safety, and releases where it is not. On March 31, the Court issued an order granting this relief and enjoining the government's ""No-Release Policy."" On December 18, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the preliminary inunction and the case was referred to a Magistrate Judge for settlement proceedings. <hr>

On February 28, 2020, a noncitizen placed in a federal immigration detention facility and denied bond or release while awaiting immigration hearings filed this class-action suit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Represented by the New York Civil Liberties Foundation and the Bronx Defenders, the petitioner sued the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and individual agency officials; he filed a habeas petition to challenge that the absence of an adequate individual custody determination, which led to him being denied bond or release violated his statutory, regulatory, and constitutional rights. He sought declaratory relief that the ICE's practices were unlawful and an injunction ordering the government to conduct adequate individualized custody determinations for members of the proposed classes. 

The policy challenged by the petitioner is referred to in the complaint as the ""No-Release Policy."" It is ICE's alleged policy of denying release and bond to <i>all</i> immigrant detainees arrested in the New York City area. The complaint asserted that the No-Release Policy violated federal law which requires that, within 48 hours of their arrest, many immigrant detainees get an individualized determination of whether they can be released while immigration proceedings go forward. According to data obtained by the petitioner's counsel under the Freedom of Information Act, ""from 2013 to June 2017, approximately 47% of those deemed to be low risk by the government were granted release. From June 2017 to September 2019, that figure plummeted to 3%."" Furthermore, the complaint alleged that in mid-2017, ICE had modified its risk-assessment tool's algorithm to prevent it from recommending that noncitizens be released--the tool was only able to recommend further detention. The petitioner claimed that the No-Release Policy resulted in thousands of detainees being denied individualized custody determinations and remaining in detention facilities ""under harsh conditions of confinement akin to criminal incarceration."" 

The petitioner asserted four causes of action; violations of ""the Immigration and Nationality Act and its implementing regulations, the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the Administrative Procedure Act, and the Rehabilitation Act."" 

The two classes proposed by the petitioner were:
(1) The Petitioner Class: All individuals eligible to be considered for bond or release on recognizance under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(1)-(2) by ICE’s New York Field Office who have been or will be detained without bond; and
(2) the Rehabilitation Act Subclass: All individuals with a disability, as defined by the Rehabilitation Act and its implementing regulations, who are eligible to be considered for bond or release on recognizance under 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a)(1)-(2) by ICE’s New York Field Office and who have been or will be detained without bond.

The case was assigned to Judge Hellerstein. The petitioner's motion for class certification is pending before the district court and the government has yet to file a response to the complaint. 

On March 16, 2020, the petitioner filed a motion for a preliminary injunction, which argued: <blockquote>This illegal practice of mass detention causes enormous and unnecessary irreparable harm, separating people from their families, jobs, and communities and exposing them to serious health risks without any individualized determination of whether the ongoing denial of liberty is justified. Exacerbating these harms—and increasing the urgency of the petitioners’ request for relief—is the threat posed by COVID-19, the pandemic experts predict will spread to New York City area immigration detention centers in a matter of days, bringing with it the threat of infection, pneumonia, sepsis, or even death.</blockquote> The motion sought prompt provide individualized determinations for class members assessing ""whether detention is necessary based on individualized assessments of the petitioners’ flight risk, danger to the community, and disability and issue class-wide preliminary declaratory relief ordering the same. Pursuant to its habeas jurisdiction, the Court should order release in the event of noncompliance with this procedural remedy."" 

In opposition to the motion for PI, defendants offered ""a single core argument upon which most of its other contentions rely: The No-Release Policy does not exist."" Instead, defendants claim that they are exercising discretion in the making of each individual custody determination. As their secondary argument, defendants asserted that ""review is unavailable under the APA because Plaintiffs have not exhausted administrative remedies and because Plaintiffs do not challenge 'final agency action.'""

Following expedited briefing and a telephonic hearing, on March 31, Judge Hellerstein issued an order granting the plaintiffs' motion for preliminary injunction (PI). The order enjoined ICE's New York Field Office Director from following the No-Release Policy and to return to its pre-June 2017 practice of making individualized assessments about whether detention is justified by flight risk or danger. The defendants are required to file a report by April 17, 2020, identifying ""all persons thus arrested by or under the authority of ICE's New York City Field Office and, of such persons, all such persons who have had their bond or recognizance application heard by an immigration judge."" <a href=""https://www.nyclu.org/en/press-releases/nyclu-and-bronx-defenders-statement-preliminary-injunction-no-release-lawsuit"">According to the NYCLU</a>, ""as a result of this ruling, many class members who are in ICE detention must be promptly evaluated for release. This expedited decision provides much-needed relief for people in detention who are exposed to the increasing threat of coronavirus spreading through crowded jails."" In issuing the order, Judge Hellerstein did not provide a statement of its reasoning due to the expedited circumstances; however,  ""the Court, in due course, intends to deliver a more fulsome statement of its reasoning."" 

On April 27, plaintiffs filed a letter addressed to Judge Hellerstein requesting information regarding defendants' compliance with the PI. The defendants responded to the plaintiffs' letter on May 1. The Clearinghouse does not have access to these filings, so the extent to which the defendants have complied with the PI is unclear.

On May 4, Judge Hellerstein issued ""a formal opinion explaining more fully the Court's reasoning for its oral ruling granting Plaintiffs' motion"" for a PI. Judge Hellerstein concluded that ""[p]laintiffs have established a clear and substantial likelihood of being able to demonstrate that the No-Release Policy exists . . . and that none of the procedural hurdles identified by Defendants preclude my awarding injunctive relief in Plaintiffs' favor."" In concluding that the plaintiffs were likely to demonstrate that the No-Release Policy exists, Judge Hellerstein was persuaded by data provided by the plaintiff showing a ""substantial increase in detention rates for final decisions in the New York Field Office beginning in 2017."" Moreover, defendants acknowledged that a No-Release Policy ""is inconsistent with the INA and regulations passed thereunder, at least without notice-and-comment rule making."" Because ""the Court ha[d] already found that Plaintiffs have shown they will suffer irreparable harm without relief and that the equities tilt in Plaintiffs' favor, injunctive relief is called for here."" 2020 WL 2114984. (S.D.N.Y. May 04, 2020). Judge Hellerstein stated at the end of this opinion that the parties had disagreements regarding the implementation of the PI and that these disagreements ""culminated in the government's filing of a motion to clarify and/or amend the injunction"" on May 1. 

After expedited briefing and hearing, Judge Hellerstein issued an order on May 15 denying the defendants' motion to clarify/amend the PI. Judge Hellerstein stated that <blockquote>Defendants were required to: 1. Apply the injunction to all persons who were detained as of April 10, 2020 pursuant to 8 U.S.C. § 1226(a), except those persons already given an individualized custody determination by an immigration judge, and expeditiously determine, or redetermine, their custody status consistent with the injunction; and to 2. Report to the court on May 22, 2020, and weekly thereafter, as to the progress made, which shall be steady and expeditious. All custody determinations and redeterminations must be completed by June 5, 2020. If extensions are required, Defendants may make an application therefore, showing good cause.</blockquote> Judge Hellerstein followed up his May 15 order, giving further explanation of his decision to deny the motion to amend or modify. On July 1, the parties filed a stipulated protective order.

On July 6, the defendants filed a notice of interlocutory appeal. The appeal was assigned USCA Case No. 20-2153. The appeal was withdrawn on October 13. 2020 WL 7973940.

On September 21, the district court filed an order directing the parties how to proceed. The court granted the Plaintiffs' request to conduct a deposition pertaining to training received by ICE personnel with respect to the court's earlier injunction. 

On December 18, the plaintiffs filed a motion to enforce the preliminary injunction and the defendants filed their opposition on January 6, 2021, however, the Clearinghouse does not have access to these documents. 

The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Katherine H. Parker for settlement discussions, and the case remains ongoing.","
This document is a compilation of individual summaries from various segments of a federal civil case filed against Mickalis Pawn Shop LLC by the state of New York. The case, titled Velesaca v. Decker, was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York and involves a class action lawsuit against the New York Field Office of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The lead plaintiff, Jose Velesaca, is one of the thousands of individuals affected by a ""No-Release Policy"" implemented by ICE in mid-2017, which denies bond or release to the majority of individuals arrested for civil immigration offenses in the New York City area. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the New York Civil Liberties Union and The Bronx Defenders, allege that this policy violates federal law and constitutional rights, including the Rehabilitation Act and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. They seek an order requiring individualized custody determinations for themselves and all members of the proposed class, as well as a preliminary injunction to prevent the enforcement of the ""No-Release Policy"" during the COVID-19 pandemic. The defendants, represented by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, argue that the plaintiffs lack standing and are unlikely to",0.838,0.1112,0.1963,0.4326,0.0572,0.101,0.4676,0.062,0.1095
PC-MI-0009,"On May 27, 1994, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) initiated an investigation into the conditions of confinement at the Crane Correctional Facility in Coldwater, Michigan and the Scott Correctional Facility in Plymouth, Michigan (medium security prisons for women) pursuant to the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA), 42 U.S.C. § 1997.  The state refused to allow the DOJ access to the prisons to conduct an investigation, and declined to negotiate with the DOJ or resolve the allegations.

On March 27, 1995, the DOJ issued a findings letter regarding the results of the CRIPA investigation, which was conducted solely through prisoner interviews during visiting hours, as the DOJ had not been allowed access to the physical facilities.  The letter detailed findings of sexual abuse of female inmates by guards (including rapes), lack of adequate medical care, lack of mental health services, grossly deficient sanitation, crowding, and other threats to the physical safety and well-being of inmates in violation of their constitutional rights.  On March 10, 1997, the DOJ filed a lawsuit against the state of Michigan under 42 U.S.C. § 1997 in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan, Flint office, alleging that the state had violated the rights of women prisoners at Scott and Crane to be free from sexual misconduct and unlawful invasions of privacy, and to receive appropriate medical and mental health care. The medical and mental health care claims were later withdrawn.

The case had received the docket number 97-40053 in Flint, but it was quickly transferred to Detroit and given a new docket number (97-71514).  It was consolidated for discovery purposes with another case brought by women prisoners, Nunn v. Mich. Dept. of Corrections, 2:96-cv-71416, (E.D. Mich) (PC-MI-0017).  

After considerable discovery, the state and the federal government (but not the private plaintiffs in Nunn) entered into a Settlement Agreement on May 25, 1999. The District Court (Judge John Corbett O'Meara) approved the settlement agreement as a court order on September 30, 1999. The agreement provided for considerable changes to Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) policies and procedures relating to sexual misconduct. Among other things, the agreement included: preemployment screenings, staff trainings, inmate education, facilitation of inmate and staff reporting of sexual misconduct allegations, investigation of sexual misconduct allegations, approach and response to misconduct, monitoring of inmate bathroom, dressing and shower areas, pat-down searches, and inmate screenings. It further set forth terms for quality assurance and for DOJ monitoring for compliance with the terms of the agreement.   

Following execution of this settlement agreement, the case was conditionally dismissed by Judge O'Meara on September 28, 1999, pending Michigan's compliance with the terms of the agreement.  The case was placed on the court's inactive docket during this time, and the parties agreed upon an expert, Patrick McManus, to assess Michigan's compliance with the settlement agreement three and six months after its execution. The U.S. filed a memo in support of its stipulation to conditionally dismiss the case in March 2000 indicating that the expert had found Michigan to be in substantial compliance with the terms of the settlement.

The court entered an order of conditional dismissal of the case on August 17, 2000. As part of its subsequent compliance efforts, the Michigan Department of Corrections established a policy barring men from serving as resident officers in housing units in women's prisons, and began the process of replacing those positions with female officers. 

After the directive to staff housing units with female officers, male corrections officers filed a separate lawsuit alleging gender discrimination. (Everson v. Michigan Dept. of Corrections, 391 F.3d 737 (6th Cir. 2004). In December 2002, the compliance expert filed a final report concluding that defendants were in substantial compliance with much of the agreement, but because of Michigan's ongoing efforts to staff housing units with female officers, that portion of the settlement would be subject to additional monitoring. Judge O'Meara granted the parties' stipulation for Partial Unconditional Dismissal of the case in February 2003, agreeing to up to one year of continued monitoring only on the issue of female housing guards, given a pending appeal in the Everson case (the district court in that case had found the Department of Corrections could not designate such positions as ""female-only"" - that issue was being contested on appeal).  In October 2004, the defendants sought full unconditional dismissal of the case, given that the timeline for continued monitoring of the housing situation had expired (even though the Everson decision remained pending). The 6th Circuit finally issued its ruling in Everson in December 2004 (391 F.3d 737, 6th Cir. 2004), concluding that female gender was a bonafide occupational qualification for housing unit guards in women's prisons. Rehearing en banc in the Everson case was denied in March 2005.

Subsequently, on September 29, 2005, the Defendants withdrew their Motion for full unconditional dismissal of this action. Thus, all that was left of the case was the issue of the staffing of housing units by women.  That issue was finally dismissed on April 25, 2007, after the state apparently attested that only female officers were assigned to housing units in all facilities covered by the settlement agreement.

This document, titled ""Plaintiffs' Supplemental Brief Regarding the Parties' Stipulation to Dismiss this Case,"" is a comprehensive summary of a legal case filed in March 1997 under the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act (CRIPA). The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys Deborah LaBelle and Linda Nunn, brought a case against the Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) and its employees, including Director Martin and Deputy Director Bolden, for ongoing sexual misconduct and invasions of privacy against female inmates in Michigan's women's prisons. The plaintiffs sought to hold the defendants accountable for their actions and to ensure that the MDOC would provide a safe and secure environment for female inmates. The defendants, represented by attorneys Michael Cox and Frank Monticello, filed a motion for full unconditional dismissal of the case, but later withdrew it. The court proceedings, presided over by Honorable John Corbett O'Meara, resulted in a Settlement Agreement in July 2000, which required the MDOC to implement new policies and procedures, conduct pre-employment screenings, and provide staff training on sexual harassment and misconduct. The Agreement also required the MDOC to maintain a zero-tolerance policy on sexual misconduct, retaliation, and gender discrimination.

EE-MI-0048,"On September 30, 2004, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan against the Magna Donnelly Corp., Inc., a for profit corporation, under the Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA). The EEOC claimed that the corporation had failed to reasonably accommodate a woman who was able to perform the essential functions of the position yet suffered from disabilities, including multiple sclerosis. The EEOC asked the court to permanently enjoin the corporation from engaging in unlawful employment practice as well as grant relief to those employees against whom the discrimination had occurred.

Over the course of the next year, a number of settlement conferences were scheduled between the parties to take place before Magistrate Judge Ellen S. Carmod. And on October 26, 2005, Magistrate Judge Carmod granted plaintiffs' unopposed motion to consolidate the case with the ongoing litigation in EEOC. v Magna Donnelly Corporation, Inc., <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=8474"">EE-MI-0047</a>.

On December 15, 2006, United States District Judge Richard A. Enslen approved the consent decree and dismissed the case with prejudice and without costs to either party. The decree included monetary compensation for back pay to the injured employees, totaling $100,000. The corporation also agreed to provide ADA training in the normal course to managers, supervisors, and human resources staff according to a training program developed by defense counsel that had been reviewed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

The EEOC alleged that Magna Donnelly failed to provide reasonable accommodations and retaliated against individuals involved in the lawsuit. The agency requested compensation for lost earnings and nonpecuniary losses, as well as compliance with the ADA and training for management on disability and reasonable accommodation. The case was assigned to Magistrate Judge Ellen S. Carmody and later transferred to Magistrate Judge Timothy P. Greeley.

The complaint alleged that the defendant discriminated against the claimants by: 1) paying lower wages to female Flaggers than male Groundsmen, 2) refusing to allow female Flaggers to work storm trips because of their sex, 3) engaging in a pattern or practice of classifying female employees to Flaggers thus denying them equal opportunity for advancement, and 4) refusing to requalify female employees into the Groundsman position.  These actions were alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act. The case settled by entry of a consent decree in November 2004.  

The one year consent decree required the defendant to refrain from discrimination and retaliation, expunge the claimant's records, give the claimants neutral references, pay the claimants $29,526 in damages, modify its written anti-discrimination policy, distribute the policy, post notice, and give the EEOC semi-annual reports of any complaints of discrimination under the EPA or Title VII.

This is a comprehensive summary of the case filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission against Williams Electric Company and Pioneer Associates, Inc. for violating the Equal Pay Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The complaint alleges that the defendant employers engaged in discriminatory employment practices against female employees, including paying lower wages and denying equal opportunities for advancement. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys Mindy E. Weinstein, Bobby C. Simpson, and Kara L. Gibbon Haden, seek to stop the discriminatory practices and provide relief for the affected female employees, including Angela Ragland, Tina Kitchens, and Carol Redd. The defendants, represented by attorney John Doughty Cole, have been accused of willfully engaging in these practices and are required to provide monetary compensation for lost wages and damages, as well as undergo training on equal employment opportunity laws. The court granted a permanent injunction to stop the discrimination and ordered the defendants to update their anti-discrimination policies and provide a neutral letter of reference for affected employees. The defendants also waived service and a motion to amend the complaint was granted. Ultimately, the court found in favor of the plaintiffs and ordered the defendants to make monetary compensations and implement policies that provide equal employment opportunities for women.

Plaintiff alleged that the County and officials in charge of Juvenile Detention Center had a blanket policy of strip searching all pre-arraignment detainees upon their arrival at the Juvenile Detention Center, regardless of the offense charged, or whether there was any suspicion that the detainee possessed weapons or contraband.  The plaintiff, who was strip searched pursuant to this policy, alleged that that the policy violated the Fourth and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution.  Plaintiff sought compensatory and punitive damages, declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as class certification.  The County and Detention Center officials generally denied the allegations.

Shortly after the suit was filed, the District Court (Judge Judith C. Herrera) stayed the proceedings at the request of the parties so that they could pursue settlement negotiations.  Plaintiff's attorney had filed a similar class action on behalf of adult detainees that were strip searched at the Dona Ana County.  See JC-NM-0004: Lira v. Dona Ana County.  Negotiations were conducted on both the adult and juvenile cases.  On November 21, 2007, Judge William Johnson consolidated both cases, designating Lira as the lead case.

Shortly after the consolidation, the parties filed an Amended Stipulation of Settlement, under which the Defendants agreed to pay $5.3 million to resolve all class claims.  The stipulated Adult Settlement Class included all detainees who were strip searched between March 7, 2003 and March 7, 2006 at the Dona Ana County Jail prior to arraignment.  The stipulated Juvenile Settlement class included all detainees who were strip searched between May 16, 2003 and May 16, 2006 at the Dona Ana Juvenile Detention Center.  It was estimated that there were approximately 11,000 class members.  Individual claims were to be paid per an agreed upon distribution formula, with the range of expected pay-outs per individual claimant was estimated at $1,200 to $2,400. Representative plaintiffs would receive a total $200,000 or $25,000 per class representative.  $1,666,667 of the settlement fund was allocated for attorneys' fees.

Judge Johnson preliminarily approved the settlement on December 20, 2007. 

On May 20, 2008, the district court (Judge Johnson) issued a final approval of the settlement and a final judgment of dismissal in the case.  In 2011, the parties filed a Joint Motion to allow disbursement of remaining funds to two non-profit entities.

The plaintiffs, represented by the New York Civil Liberties Union, asked the court for injunction and compensatory relief, claiming that their Fourth and Fourteenth Amendment rights had been violated. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the New York City Police Department (NYPD) had violated their rights by unreasonably searching them during routine livery cab stops.

On September 3, 2010, at 11:30 P.M., one plaintiff, a lawyer in the Bronx, was leaving work and chose to use a livery cab. The cab was enrolled in the Taxi/Livery Robbery Inspection Program (TRIP), which gave consent for the cab to be stopped and inspected by the NYPD. The cab displayed a decal that indicated enrollment in TRIP.  The NYPD stopped the livery cab, and ordered the plaintiff out of the vehicle. The plaintiff protested the search without reasonable suspicion, but the police indicated that enrollment in the TRIP program gave them the right to search passengers in the livery cab.  Nothing was found.

On October 30, 2010, at 3:00 A.M., the second plaintiff, who was a manager at a popular radio station and a comedian, was returning to his home in Brooklyn in a livery cab.  This cab was also enrolled in TRIP. The car was stopped and the plaintiff ordered to exit the vehicle, at which point the plaintiff's person and belongings were searched.  Again, nothing was found. 

The plaintiffs' case was accepted by the NYCLU and the New York University School of Law Civil Rights Clinic, and a complaint was filed alleging that the search of passengers in livery cabs without reasonable suspicion was unconstitutional.

On May 14, 2012, the Court (Judge Richard M. Berman) entered a stipulation and order of dismissal, because the case had settled.  The Settlement contained $10,000 relief for each plaintiff ($20,000 total), $38,000 in attorney's fees, and injunctive-like provisions.  The NYPD agreed to suspend its routine searching of passengers of vehicles that were pulled over as part of the TRIPS program. The NYPD further agreed that it would only search passengers when reasonable suspicion of a violent crime existed.  Furthermore, the NYPD provided information that it was amending its training manual, informing officers at roll-call citywide (repeating it for 10 day periods, for three times over the next year), and issuing an operations order communicating the order to not search passengers absent reasonable suspicion of a violent crime during a TRIP stop.

The case was dismissed with the approval of the settlement.

The plaintiffs, represented by Narciso Garcia, Jr., alleged violations of labor/management relations against the defendants, represented by Thomas L Stahl and William Garth Gilchrist. The plaintiffs sought damages and relief for the alleged violations, which included sexual harassment and failure to take appropriate action. The defendants denied these allegations and filed a notice about a related case, 04cv1117. They also served a set of requests for production of documents to the plaintiffs' counsel. The district judge consolidated this case with another case, 04-1417, and after a pre-trial conference, a memorandum, opinion, and order were issued by the district judge, remanding the remaining claims to the state court.

The DOJ alleged that the Defendant-bank, a Nebraska-based lender, had no formal policy for setting borrowers' interest rates but that the Defendant systematically charged American Indian borrowers much higher interest rates than white borrowers.

The parties entered a consent decree on May 7, 1997. The consent decree enjoined the Defendant from future acts of discrimination against American Indians and required the Defendant to create a special fund of $175,000 to compensate American Indians for past acts of discrimination. The decree also required the Defendant to set aside $25,000 in each of the following four years to pay for credit report service fees incurred in connection with loan applications by American Indians. The Defendant-bank also agreed to market its products to American Indians and recruit them for employment and promotion.

The consent decree terminated in 2001, and the case is now closed.

This document, entitled ""United States v. First National Bank of Gordon: A Comprehensive Summary of a Housing Discrimination Lawsuit,"" outlines the case brought by the United States against the First National Bank of Gordon, a financial institution in Nebraska. The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the U.S. Department of Justice and the U.S. Attorney's Office, alleged that the bank engaged in discriminatory lending practices, specifically targeting African American and Hispanic applicants. The complaint also accused the bank of redlining, or denying loans to individuals in minority neighborhoods. The government demanded $1.2 million in damages and sought to establish a fund to compensate those who were discriminated against. The defendant, represented by attorneys from two law firms, was accused of violating the Fair Housing Act. The case was assigned to U.S. District Judge Richard H. Battey and a jury trial was requested by the plaintiff. The complaint highlighted instances where American Indian customers were treated unfairly, such as being asked for more financial information, being denied loans despite qualifications, and being charged higher interest rates and fees. After an investigation by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, a settlement was reached, which required the bank to pay damages and implement policies to prevent future discrimination.

FH-NH-0001,"On July 19, 2010, the United States Department of Justice filed a lawsuit under the Fair Housing Act of 1988, §42 U.S.C. §§3601-3631 against the owner and manager of a four-unit apartment building in Monroe, New Hampshire. The plaintiff brought the suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of New Hampshire, on behalf of a  mixed-national origin and race family, claiming the Defendant engaged in discriminatory housing practices.  The complaint sets out allegations involving ethnic slurs and other bad treatment of the complainant family, including incidents that led to the arrest of the landlord and state court orders against him.  The U.S. sought to enjoin further discrimination on the basis of race, color, or national origin and asked for compensatory and punitive damages to the complainants.  The complainants intervened in the suit a few months later.  

On April 7, 2011, the United States District Court for the District of New Hampshire (Judge Landya McCafferty) approved a consent decree.  The decree enjoined the defendant and its employees from making statements with respect to the rental of a dwelling that indicated a preference, limitation or discrimination based on race, color, or national origin; or coercing, threatening, intimidating, or interfering with any tenant's exercised or enjoyed rights.  The defendant was required to get tenants' permission prior to entering units, except to make emergency repairs.  In addition, the defendant agreed to undertake fair housing training of all employees, and a set of recordkeeping and reporting requirements.   Finally, the defendant agreed to pay the complainants $15,000 in compensatory damages.  The consent order was set to last two years, unless the defendant retained any direct or indirect ownership, management, or other financial interest in any residential rental property, in which case the consent order was to remain in effect for three years. 

The consent decree terminated without any further litigation, and the case is now closed.","

This document, docket number 1:10-cv-297, is a complaint filed by the United States of America against Lothar Riba for violations of the Fair Housing Act. The plaintiffs in this case are Brenda and Robert Santana, who have filed a motion to intervene as plaintiffs. The complaint alleges that Riba, the defendant, has discriminated against the Santanas based on their race, color, and national origin in relation to the rental of an apartment unit. The Santanas, who have disabilities and use service animals, have faced discrimination and harassment from Riba, including being denied permission to have a family member stay with them and facing derogatory comments and discriminatory actions. The plaintiffs are seeking a jury trial and monetary damages for the harm they have suffered, as well as a judgment declaring Riba's conduct as a violation of the Fair Housing Act.

CJ-MO-0001,"On July 28, 2005 a death-sentenced inmate of the Potosi Correctional Center in Washington County, Missouri, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Missouri Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Missouri.  He claimed that there was a 43% chance that the defendants' planned lethal injection procedure would torture him and cause him unnecessary pain.  He argued that this violated his Eighth Amendment right to be free from cruel and unusual punishment.  He also argued that the infliction of the death penalty, and specifically the use of a form of execution more painful than necessary to bring about the death involved, violated the Thirteenth Amendment because it was a relict, vestige, and badge of slavery.  Specifically, he was concerned that that the use of the femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection would require a painful ""cut-down"" procedure, and that the anesthetic used (thiopental) would wear off too soon, allowing him to be conscious during the administration of potassium chloride, which causes a painful burning sensation throughout the body.  In addition, the plaintiff argued that the Missouri physicians who were involved in administering the lethal injections were violating their ethical obligations.

The defendants asked the court to dismiss the case, claiming that the plaintiff had to exhaust his administrative remedies before bringing the case in District Court.  On December 28, 2005, the District Court (Judge Scott O. Wright) denied their request, finding that the plaintiff did not have to exhaust his administrative remedies because if the defendants had wanted to change the method of execution due to the pain it inflicted, they would have already done so.  

On January 18, 2006, the plaintiff asked the District Court to order the defendants not to execute him until the court had held a hearing and decided how to resolve the issues in the case.  The next day, the District Court (Judge Wright) granted his request and ordered the defendants not to execute the plaintiff until the court told them that they could do so.  The defendants appealed.  On January 29, 2006, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit (Judges William J. Riley, Clarence Arlen Beam, and David Rasmussen Hansen) vacated the stay and ordered the District Court to hold a hearing before noon on February 1, 2006.  They also held that the execution should be stayed until midnight on February 3, 2006.  

According to the Eighth Circuit's order, the District Court held a hearing to decide the merits of the case on January 31, 2006.  After the hearing, Court (Judge Fernando J. Gaitan, Jr.) found that neither the chemicals used by the State of Missouri for lethal injection nor the procedure employed to administer these injections constituted cruel and unusual punishment.  The Court reasoned that while the plaintiff suggested a different approach to lethal injection, he did not prove that the current method used by Missouri violated the Eighth Amendment to the Constitution.  The Court also said that it was not persuaded that the use of the femoral vein for the administration of the lethal injection violated applicable standards of the Eighth Amendment, and it did not believe that the Missouri physicians who were involved in administering the lethal injections were violating their ethical obligations.  Finally, the Court said that the lethal injection procedure did not violate the Thirteenth Amendment's prohibition of slavery.  The plaintiff appealed.  

On April 27, 2006, the Eighth Circuit (Judges Riley, Beam, and Hansen) issued a per curiam opinion vacating the District Court's decision and remanding the case so that the lower court could hold a more thorough hearing and expand the record.  The Eighth Circuit decided to do this because they felt that the time constraints that they had imposed on the lower court had been unreasonable, and they wished to allow the parties more time to present their cases.  Taylor v. Crawford, 445 F.3d 1095 (8th Cir. 2006).

After holding a more extensive hearing, the District Court ruled on June 26, 2006, amended its earlier decision, ordering the defendants to prepare a written protocol for lethal injections that included the following changes:  1) a board certified anesthesiologist must be responsible for the mixing and administering of all drugs used during the lethal injection, 2) at least 5 grams of thiopental must be administered and the anesthesiologist must certify that the thiopental has rendered the plaintiff unconscious, 3) the state must purchase any equipment necessary to allow the anesthesiologist to monitor the depth of the anesthetic, in order to insure that the plaintiff will not feel any pain, 4) the state must have a contingency plan in place in case problems develop during the execution procedure, 5) an auditing process must be in place to ensure that all individuals involved in the lethal injection process are correctly following the protocol, and 6) after the Court approves the lethal injection protocol, it must not be changed without the prior approval of the Court.  The District Court then sent this ruling up to the Eighth Circuit for their consideration and approval.  Taylor v. Crawford, 2006 WL 1779035 (W.D.Mo. June 26, 2006).

On July 24, 2006, the defendants filed a revised protocol for use in carrying out the inmate's death sentence in the District Court, and the Eighth Circuit remanded their jurisdiction back to the lower court so that the new protocol could be considered.  On September 12, 2006, the District Court (Judge Gaitan) rejected the defendants' revised protocol, saying that even though it was an improvement, it was not enough to meet the standards of the Constitution because it lacked a provision for purchase of equipment that allows monitoring of anesthetic depth.  The Court ordered the defendants to submit a revised protocol to the Court by October 27, 2006.  

The defendants asked the District Court to reconsider their rejection of the revised protocol, and on October 16, 2006, the District Court (Judge Gaitan) refused to reconsider the decision.  The defendants appealed that refusal, and on June 4, 2007, the Eighth Circuit reversed the District Court's decision, holding that the defendants' proposed revisions of the protocol were sufficient to get rid of any Constitutional problems.  They also vacated the District Court's injunction that had forbidden the defendants from executing the plaintiff.  The plaintiff asked the Eighth Circuit to rehear the case en banc, and on August 8, 2007, the Eighth Circuit declined to do so.  The plaintiff filed a writ of certiorari in the U.S. Supreme Court, but the Supreme Court declined to hear the case.

Missouri Gov. Jay Nixon denied the inmate's request for clemency and he was executed on February 25, 2014.","

The document under review, entitled ""Court Filings and Docket Texts from Taylor v. Crawford,"" is a compilation of court documents and docket texts from the legal case involving plaintiff Michael Taylor, defendants Larry Crawford and James D. Purkett, and the State of Missouri. The case, which began in 2005, centers around the use of lethal injection as a method of execution and whether it violates the Eighth Amendment's prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment. Taylor, who was sentenced to death for the murder of a 15-year-old girl, alleges that the use of a paralytic drug in Missouri's lethal injection protocol poses an unnecessary risk of pain and suffering. He seeks preliminary, declaratory, and permanent injunctive relief to prevent his execution and to declare the use of the femoral vein for lethal injections unconstitutional. The plaintiffs are represented by a team of experienced attorneys, including John William Simon, Eric Berger, Ginger Anders, and Donald B. Verrilli. On the other hand, the defendants, the State of Missouri, are represented by attorney Michael Pritchett of the State Attorney General's office. The court held several telephone conferences and an evidentiary hearing, where expert medical testimony was provided.

ED-SD-0002,"Plaintiffs, minor students, filed this class action lawsuit on March 27, 2006, against Winner School District and three of its administrators in the U.S. District Court for the District of South Dakota. Plaintiffs, who were Native American, alleged that employees of the School District engaged in a pattern or practice of intentional racial discrimination with the purpose of pushing Native American students out of the school system. Specifically, plaintiffs alleged that the School District disciplinary practices targeted Native American students by disciplining them more often and more harshly than other students, referring them to law enforcement for minor infractions, and coercing criminal confessions out of them. They also alleged that teachers and administrators tolerated and fostered a racially hostile school environment by allowing racial name-calling and bullying to occur and treating Native American parents with disrespect. As a result, Native American students were less likely to complete high school and felt demoralized at school. 

Represented by the ACLU and the Rosebud Sioux Attorney General's Office, plaintiffs brought claims under the Fifth Amendment, the Due Process Clause and Equal Protection Clauses of the Fourteenth Amendment, and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief pursuant to 42 U.S.C. §1983. Plaintiffs also asked the court to certify as a class all Native American students who were or would be enrolled in Winner School District's middle and high schools.

On April 28, 2006, plaintiffs submitted a motion for class certification. The parties began the discovery process in June. On October 20, 2006, Judge Charles B. Kornmann issued an order granting class certification.

After a series of mediation sessions, the parties settled and filed a proposed Settlement Agreement on May 30, 2007. A court-enforceable Consent Decree was entered by Judge Kornmann on December 10, 2007. The terms of the Consent Decree prohibited defendants from requiring any student to make a written statement (""affidavit"") that could be used against him or her in legal proceedings. The Decree also required defendants to immediately notify parents after deciding to refer a student to law enforcement and to notify students of their legal right to remain silent in such a case; train School District employees on proper disciplinary procedures and the constitutional rights of students; obtain an independent expert to assist with the development of disciplinary matrices; keep accurate records of disciplinary incidents; conduct evaluations of students subjected to discipline three or more times over the course of a year; hire a Native American ombudsperson; train teachers on American Indian education and educational equity; increase its number of Native American employees; and take several other measures designed to eliminate racial discimination and create an inclusive environment for Native American students and families. Defendants were also ordered to find and appoint a Monitor to oversee and report on the implementation of the Consent Decree.

The court maintained jurisdiction for enforcement purposes. The Decree was to stay in effect until defendants had achieved and maintained compliance for four years. Finally, it awarded plaintiffs $100,000 in attorneys' fees and costs. 

The first and second progress reports, filed in June and September 2008, indicated that defendants had made progress in all areas. Among other things, they had hired more Native American staff members, developed anti-bullying programming, and developed a disciplinary matrix. 

On January 8, 2014, the parties proposed an Amended Consent Decree. The court granted the Amended Decree on April 28, 2014. The new agreement was very similar to the original, but required that, if the School District reached all outcome measures within the following two years, it would be released from the Agreement. If some measures were not reached within that time, the District would be formally released from having to reach those outcomes but would be required to continue a good-faith effort to do so for the following two years. 

On May 31, 2017, the parties jointly filed a motion to terminate the Consent Decree after finding that defendants had met all of their obligations. Judge Kornmann formally terminated the Decree on June 6, 2017.

This document, titled ""Amended Consent Decree in the Case of Native American Students v. Winner School District,"" details a class action lawsuit brought by eleven Native American students and their families against the Winner School District in South Dakota. The plaintiffs, represented by their legal guardians, alleged that the district was engaging in discriminatory practices and creating a racially hostile environment towards Native American students. They sought relief in the form of a consent decree, which would require the district to implement changes to improve the educational experience of Native American students. The defendant, the Winner School District, denied the allegations. After seven years of court proceedings and collaborative efforts between the parties, the consent decree was successfully implemented. In 2014, the plaintiffs and defendant jointly requested that the court terminate the decree, which was granted on June 6, 2017.

IM-DC-0065,"On August 17, 2018, 29 parents who were forcibly separated from their children by the federal government filed this lawsuit in U.S. District Court of District Columbia. The plaintiffs sued the Department of Justice for violating the Immigration and Nationality Act (8 U.S.C. §§ 1101 <i>et seq.</i>), the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 701), the Administrative Procedure Act (5 U.S.C. §§ 551 <i>et seq.</i>), and the Due Process Clause of the U.S. Constitution. The Plaintiffs, represented by Muslim Advocates as well as the Legal Aid Justice Center and the law firm of Eversheds & Sunderland, LLP, sought an order compelling the defendants to vacate the results of credible fear interviews, which had found them eligible for removal, as well as the resulting orders of removal. The plaintiffs sought declaratory relief and new credible fear interviews. 

Specifically, the plaintiffs alleged that under DOJ policy, parents were forced to undergo credible fear interviews while they were suffering from emotional and psychological trauma from being separated from their children. Credible fear interviews determine whether an asylum seeker faces a credible fear of persecution or torture when returned to their home country. Unable to articulate their experiences due to trauma, the plaintiffs received negative credible fear determinations and faced immediate deportation. 

This case was assigned to Judge Paul L. Friedman. 

On August 17, 2018, the plaintiffs filed a motion to proceed under pseudonyms and a redacted complaint. The defendant filed a motion to extend time to file an answer on October 22, 2018. On December 31, 2018, the defendant again filed such a motion.

Along with two related cases, MMM v. Sessions and Ms. L v. ICE, this case settled. On November 15, 2018, Judge Dana M. Sabraw (the judge assigned in Ms. L. v. ICE) issued a final approval of the settlement. According to this settlement, the government committed to conducting a good faith review of the plaintiff’s prior credible fear findings to determine if reconsideration would be appropriate. However, the government refused to return any parent who had already been deported.  

On February 5, 2019, the plaintiffs filed a notice of voluntary dismissal. This case is now closed, but the court in Ms. L v. ICE retained jurisdiction to enforce the settlement agreement.

This document is a comprehensive summary of the final approval of a class action settlement in the case of Ms. L v. ICE, filed on November 15, 2018 in the United States District Court for the Southern District of California. The case involved a group of immigrant parents, represented by attorneys from Hogan Lovells US LLP, who were separated from their children by the government and seeking asylum. The defendant in the case was the Department of Homeland Security, specifically U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). The plaintiffs alleged that the government's actions in separating them from their children were in violation of their rights and caused them emotional distress. The relief sought by the plaintiffs included the reunification of families and the dismissal of pending litigation. The case was filed on behalf of three separate classes: Ms. L class members, M.M.M. agreed class members, and Dora plaintiffs, all of whom were represented by the same attorneys. The court granted a preliminary injunction in favor of the plaintiffs, ordering the government to reunite the families. After extensive negotiations, the parties reached a settlement agreement, which was approved by the court. The agreement outlined procedures for handling the immigration proceedings of the separated families and provided for the reunification of families.

IM-CT-0009,"On February 13, 2012, the plaintiff filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus in this §1983 class habeas action against the Connecticut Department of Corrections. The petition was filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut and assigned to Judge Janet Bond Arteton. The plaintiffs were detainees in Connecticut Department of Corrections (CDOC) facilities who, after the expiration of the state-law basis of their detention, remained in state custody solely due to an administrative ""immigration detainer"" placed by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE).  Represented by the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, the plaintiffs sought a writ of habeas corpus requiring the state to release them, an injunction against detaining future individuals based solely on an immigration detainer, and declaratory judgment invalidating such detention.

Detainers issued by ICE request state and local law enforcement officials to hold individuals in custody, without any basis in state law, for up to 48 hours, pursuant to 8 C.F.R. §287.7. The named plaintiff's state-based detention ended on February 10, 2012; he filed the petition on February 13, 2012 when his subsequent detention continued for more than 48 hours.  On the same day, the plaintiff requested class certification of detainees similarly situated in CDOC facilities. Claiming they were detained without probable cause hearings,and that the detainer is an invalid commandeering of state officials, the plaintiff alleged violation of Fourth Amendment rights against unreasonable seizure.  Additionally, the plaintiff asserted that Fourteenth Amendment substantive and procedural due process rights were violated because the state lacked a compelling interest to continue detention.

On February 19, 2013, the parties entered a proposed settlement agreement based on the newly enacted state regulations. The settlement agreement states that if an ICE immigration detainer is placed on a detainee, he or she will be notified by the CDOC as soon as practicable.  If the detainee's state-based detention has expired and the detainee does not have a prior order of removal or meet certain ""dangerousness criteria"" set forth in the statute, the detainee shall not be held. The statute allowed for only rare occasions where CDOC could use its discretion to continue detention. The court approved the settlement agreement on March 5, 2013.  

The settlement agreement was set to expire on February 2, 2017. On February 2, 2017, the parties jointly moved to extend the termination date of the settlement agreement from February 2, 2017 to February 2, 2018. The court ordered the modification of the settlement agreement to reflect the extension that day, and the settlement agreement remained otherwise unchanged. On January 19, 2018, the parties moved to extend the settlement agreement for another year, and on January 26, 2018, the court modified the agreement with a new termination date of February 2, 2019.

As of April 14, 2020, there are no further entries in the docket and the settlement is presumed to have lapsed. ","

This case, titled ""Sergio Brizuela v. Jose Feliciano, et al."", is a class action lawsuit filed by petitioner Sergio Brizuela against respondents Jose Feliciano, Leo C. Arnone, and the Connecticut Department of Correction (DOC). Brizuela, who has lived in the New York-Connecticut area for over 10 years, was arrested in November 2011 and unable to post bond due to an immigration detainer issued by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). He remains detained at the New Haven Correctional Center despite serving his sentence and pleading guilty to several charges. Brizuela, along with other undocumented immigrants in the DOC's custody, challenges the DOC's policies and procedures regarding the handling of ICE detainers and the treatment of ICE detainees. The plaintiffs, represented by the Legal Aid Society of New York and the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, allege that the DOC's actions violate their constitutional rights and seek declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as damages.

JI-CT-0004,"This class action brought by children placed in Connecticut's Department of Children and Youth Services (DCYS) was filed on December 19, 1989, in the U.S. District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs were represented by the Connecticut Civil Liberties Union Foundation and the American Civil Liberties Union. They sought declaratory and injunctive relief against the state to redress deficiencies in the child welfare system, claiming that the state violated the Adoption Assistance and Child Welfare Act of 1980, the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act, and the First, Ninth, and Fourteenth Amendments. 

The complaint alleged that the defendants failed to: <ul> <li>provide adequate protective services to abused, neglected, or at risk children;
<li>provide adequate medical care, mental health treatment, substance abuse treatment, sexual abuse treatment to children in DCYS care;
<li>ensure that all children in DCYS care receive appropriate and least restrictive placements;
<li>ensure that all reports regarding these children are investigated and responded to promptly by caseworkers;
<li>provide sufficient and trained staff;
<li>provide adequate records and information systems;
<li>make reasonable efforts to keep families together by providing threatened families with reasonable and appropriate services to prevent placement into out-of-home care;
<li>provide minimally adequate and appropriate care to all of the children, placed by DCYS, into foster homes or similar settings;
<li>move children into adoptive or other permanent homes when reunification is impossible; and
<li>develop and implement appropriate case plans that will assure permanent placements for all children in their custody.</ul> On January 7, 1991, the parties reached a settlement agreement mandating broad scale reform. The Court entered a consent decree reflecting their agreement and requiring the defendants to: <ul><li>establish a training academy and statewide computerized data system; <li>appoint an advisory board; <li>design and implement a management structure that delineates reporting relationships; <li>establish a health management unit for children under the supervision, care or custody of the department; <li>increase staff by hiring qualified and experienced individuals; <li>establish comprehensive guidelines and regulations to facilitate the uniform intake and investigation of reports of suspected child abuse or neglect; <li>institute standards for treatment, case management, and family training, <li>implement objectives and goals for adoptions, <li>establish regional resource groups for consultations and evaluations; <li>develop procedures to complete Probate Court Ordered Studies within the timeframes specified by state law; and <li>establish a DCYS Monitoring Panel to determine, promulgate, or approve standards and procedures to fulfill the mandates of the Consent Decree, to implement reasonable timetables, and to establish mandatory funding amounts to ensure compliance.</ul> The Consent Decree could be modified, amended, or changed by the trial judge, but only upon the filing of an appropriate motion by a party or the DCYS Monitoring Panel. 

On December 19, 1996, the plaintiffs filed a motion for contempt. The defendants admitted to noncompliance and after extended negotiations the defendants agreed in October 2003 to: require the monitor to develop a definitive exit plan with specific outcomes; establish a Transition Task Force to assume all decisionmaking authority having substantial impact on the plaintiffs' safety and welfare; establish funds of $1 million for meeting emergency needs of class members; and to ensure that the governor would not replace the Commissioner during the term of this order without consulting the monitor first. Shortly thereafter, the monitor developed an exit plan detailing the necessary reforms and benchmarks that the defendants would have to meet. This plan was entered as a court order on December 23, 2003. It was modified three years later.

Despite some improvements made by the defendants, the plaintiffs formally reported noncompliance again on May 5, 2008. Two months later, the plaintiffs withdrew their assertions of noncompliance pursuant to another stipulated agreement in which the defendant's agreed to comply with the foster-care recruitment and retention plans, administrative case reviews and treatment planning conferences plans, and health-care requirements.

In December 2009, the plaintiffs moved for a temporary restraining order, a preliminary injunction, and a permanent injunction to prevent the defendants from suspending new intakes to one of their programs, the Voluntary Services Program. The defendants responded by arguing that the children receiving treatment or assistance in that program were not members of the plaintiff class. A year later, the court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, stating that children in the Voluntary Services Program were indeed members of the class. On August 17, 2010, the court granted in part and denied in part the motion for preliminary injunction and motion for permanent injunction. The defendants filed a motion for reconsideration on August 31, 2010, but the court denied the motion four months later. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 135238; 2010 WL 5376224. 

In the meantime, while that motion for injunctive relief was pending, on April 13, 2010, the defendants sought to vacate the Consent Decree and Exit Plan, claiming that the objectives of the Consent Decree and Exit Plan had been achieved and that factual and legal changes would make continued enforcement unfair. The court denied the defendant’s motion to vacate on September 22, 2010. The court also directed the parties to meet immediately with the court monitor to discuss new methods of evaluating the state's performance. 2010 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 99455; 2010 WL 5590094.

For the next seven years, the monitor periodically provided the court with revised exit plan quarterly reports. The most recent exit plan was submitted by the court monitor's office on May 1, 2017. The parties were then given an opportunity to respond to the recommended exit plan, and when both did, the court scheduled settlement talks with Magistrate Judge Holly B. Fitzsimmons for later that year. 

It's not clear if the parties agreed on a revised exit plan or if the court adopted one on its own, but on December 13, 2017, the Court entered a 2017 Revised Exit Plan and it appears that since then the case has continued by reference to compliance with that. That exit plan identified 14 relevant outcome measures. The plan also required the Court Monitor to conduct what it referred to as ""Certification"" reviews to ensure that defendants were in compliance with all of the outcome measures, and in sustained compliance with all of the outcome measures for at least two quarters prior to asserting compliance. The Court Monitor would then conduct a review of a statistically significant valid sample of cases to determined whether the defendants were in compliance.

The parties and Court Monitor later created a ""Pre-Certification"" review process. This intended to obviate the need to implement the full certification review for certain outcome measures after sustained compliance had been achieved for all outcome measures. Under this process, if DCF achieved sustained compliance for at least two consecutive quarters, the Court Monitor could, in his discretion, conduct a pre-certification review. The purpose of this review was to identify and provide a prompt and timely opportunity to remedy any problem areas. 

In February of 2019, the Court Monitor released the Revised Exit Plan Status Report, covering the period from April 1, 2018, to September 30, 2018. It found that of the ten remaining outcome measures, there were five that had not been pre-certified.

A year later, in February of 2020, the Court Monitor released another Exit Plan Status Report, covering the period from April 1, 2019 to September 30, 2019. The monitor found one more of the outstanding outcome measures, relating to the caseloads of DCF social workers, had been pre-certified, leaving four outcome measures awaiting pre-certification.

As of October 7, 2020, the Court Monitor has continued to assess compliance under the 2017 Revised Exit Plan, and the litigation is ongoing, presumably until the outcome measures required by the exit plan are met.","

Underhill in the United States District Court for the District of Connecticut. The plaintiffs, F. Juan, were represented by Next Friends Brian Lynch and Isabel Romero, while the defendants were the Department of Children & Families and former governor M. Jodi Rell. The plaintiffs alleged that the DCF had violated their constitutional rights by failing to provide adequate care and services while they were under the custody of the DCF. They sought a revised exit plan that would address these issues and ensure proper care for all children in the DCF's custody. The attorneys involved in the case included Raymond Mancuso, representing the court-appointed monitor, and Brian Lynch and Isabel Romero, representing the plaintiffs. Over the course of the case, there were multiple status conferences, a settlement conference, and hearings to review and approve the revised exit plan. After considering all the evidence and arguments presented by both parties, the court ultimately approved the revised exit plan, which addressed the concerns raised by the plaintiffs.

In a December 19, 1996 letter to the mayor of Philadelphia, the Department of Justice described the unconstitutional conditions in the facility.  The facility failed to ensure the safety of or provide the most basic care to its residents.  Staff neglected residents and allowed them to reside in unsanitary conditions.  In 1994, the city had privatized the facility, turning its management over to Episcopal Long Term Care, and a previous investigation by the Pennsylvania Department of Health found chaotic conditions in the facility.  

The Department of Justice filed a complaint on August 13, 1998 against the City of Philadelphia and Episcopal Long Term Care in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania.  The complaint sought to enjoin the defendant from violating the constitutional rights of PNH residents.  It alleged that the defendants had also violated the Nursing Home Reform Act, CRIPA, and the False Claims Act, and were unjustly enriched by funds received from the federal government.  

The parties reached a settlement agreement, which was filed contemporaneously with the complaint.  The City of Philadelphia and Episcopal Long Term Care agreed to do the following:

•	ensure that residents were free from mistreatment and neglect;

•	provide adequate psychiatric, medical, and nursing care;

•	limit the use of restraints;

•	allow a federal monitor to implement the agreement;

•	pay $50,000 for violating the False Claims Act; and, 

•	create a $15,000 fund to improve the lives of residents.

The complaint states that a Hispanic female employee alleged national origin discrimination in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, she alleged that she was unlawfully terminated when the defendant instituted a discriminatory English-only policy.  After only a single EEOC motion to compel, the parties settled and a consent decree was entered in June 2006.  

In the consent decree, the parties agreed that the defendant would pay the aggrieved party $10,000, refrain from retaliating and discriminating on the basis of national origin, implement an English-only policy only when absolutely necessary for the performance of a specific job, post EEO notices, distribute copies of its anti-discrimination policy, provide two hours of EEO training annually, retain all records of complaints, and make semiannual reports to the EEOC.

PN-MI-0002,"On March 11, 2004, the City of Detroit removed a state court lawsuit to the United States Court for the Eastern District of Michigan. The lawsuit was filed under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the City of Detroit and Wayne County, as well as the Detroit Psychiatric Institute.  The plaintiff's estate, represented by the Innocence Project, asked the Court for compensatory and punitive damages, claiming that the defendants violated his First, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Fourteenth Amendment, as well as the The Rehabilitation Act and also claimed violations of the state constitution. Specifically, the plaintiff's estate claimed that the plaintiff's wrongful conviction was the product of malicious police tactics that coerced a false confession from a mentally ill and hospitalized man.

In 1984, a 16-year-old girl named Michelle Jackson was found dead in a warehouse in Detroit. She had been sodomized and killed.  Her death was part of a string of 47 rapes and disappearances between September 1983 and 1984. The plaintiff, a man declared legally mentally incompetent, had a habit of calling the police and offering  to help them solve rapes and murders.  When the police approached the plaintiff in 1984, officers convinced him that his confession would lure the real killer out into the open.  The plaintiff confessed under this delusional belief, was convicted, sentenced to life in prison. He remained in prison for 17 years. 

The plaintiff's appellate attorney, Robert Slameka, refused to communicate with the plaintiff.  When the plaintiff filed a grievance against Mr. Slameka, he responded that the plaintiff's ""claim of my wrongdoing is frivolous, just as his existence. Both should be terminated.""  The plaintiff was exonerated by DNA evidence in 2002. 

The plaintiff filed this action alleging that the detectives concealed evidence in bad faith, that his trial and appellate attorneys were ineffective, and that the result was false imprisonment in violation of the Constitution. He also alleged that the Detroit Psychiatric Institute cooperated with the police in prolonging his hospitalization and coercing his confession.

The plaintiff died while the lawsuit was pending, in 2005. The plaintiff's estate filed an Amended Complaint on May 10, 2005.

On May 5, 2006, the parties settled the case. The Court (Judge Gerald Rosen) entered a Consent Judgment. The Consent Judgment required the City of Detroit to pay the plaintiff's estate 3.25 million dollars.  In addition, there was a side agreement, provided as an exhibit to the Consent Judgment, under which the City agreed to make a good-faith effort to implement video recording by January 1, 2007, and to to submit bi-monthly reports on its progress to the Plaintiff's estate.

A Satisfaction of Judgment was entered on July 10, 2007, and the case was closed. We have no further information about the City's compliance with the Consent Judgment.","

This document is a 49-page complaint and demand for a jury trial, filed in May 2005 by plaintiffs Ruth Harlin and Tia Terese Glenn on behalf of the Estate of Eddie Joe Lloyd. The defendants in this case include the City of Detroit, Wayne County, and several police officers, who are accused of deceiving and manipulating evidence to falsely convict Mr. Lloyd of first-degree murder in 1985. Mr. Lloyd, a psychiatric patient at the time, was coerced into confessing to the crime by Officer Thomas DeGalan, who took advantage of his delusions and fed him details of the crime to make his confession consistent with the evidence. The plaintiffs seek compensatory and punitive damages, as well as other forms of relief, for the violations of Mr. Lloyd's rights under the US Constitution and state laws. The attorneys involved in the case include Robert Slameka, who represented Mr. Lloyd during his unsuccessful appeals, and Saul Green, who joined the Wayne County Prosecutor's Office in motioning to vacate Mr. Lloyd's conviction after DNA evidence proved his innocence.

Holt Enterprises d/b/a Sirloin Stockade alleging violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the EEOC alleged that the defendant had sexually harassed female employees and created a hostile work environment as a result.  The parties quickly worked out an agreement and, in January 2000, they were able to file a Notice of Settlement with the court.  The court subsequently approved their consent decree in March 2000.  The decree awarded $7,700 to one complainant and enjoined the defendant from discriminating in the future.

The document in question is a complaint filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against J. Holt Enterprises, a Texas corporation doing business as Sirloin Stockade restaurant. The complaint alleges that the restaurant's male managers and supervisors engaged in unlawful employment practices, including sexual harassment of female employees.

The EEOC claims that Frasier and other female employees were subjected to a hostile work environment and were denied equal employment opportunities due to the restaurant's actions.

EE-IL-0123,"This case was filed by the Chicago office of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in June 2001 in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois. The EEOC alleged that the defendant, a telemarketer of small business consulting packages based in Buffalo Grove, IL, violated Title VII of the Civil Rights Act by carrying out a pattern or practice of discrimination by subjecting female employees to sexual harassment. EEOC also alleged the defendant made favorable employment actions contingent upon the performance of sexual favors. The case was before Judge Joan B. Gottschall.

Two of the employees allegedly harassed filed related suits (see related cases EE−IL−0307 and EE-IL-0308), and two other employees intervened in the EEOC's suit. The discovery stage of this litigation was protracted, with several dozen discovery motions being filed over the course of a five-year period. 

On October 23, 2007, the court divided the case into two phases to be tried before one jury. 2007 WL 3120067. In phase I, the EEOC had to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the sexual harassment that occurred at the defendant business during the relevant time period, taken as a whole, was so severe or pervasive that a reasonable woman would find the work environment to be hostile or abusive. EEOC also had to establish that the defendant knew, or should have known, that systematic sexual harassment was occurring in its offices but did not take adequate steps to address the problem. In Phase II, the EEOC had to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that each individual claimant seeking monetary damages experienced sex-based harassment that an objectively reasonable woman would find severe or pervasive enough to constitute a hostile work environment and demonstrate that each claimant subjectively perceived the harassment she experienced to be hostile or abusive. 

The defendant sought summary judgment on the individual claims in this case in a series of motions spanning from 2006 to 2009. For the purpose of resolving the summary judgment motions, the court assumed that the EEOC had prevailed in their required showings at Phase I. The court entered orders on July 14, 2008, July 7, 2009, and August 13, 2009. Within these orders, the court granted and denied in part the defendant's summary judgment, finding the harassment was not sufficiently severe for all claimants and dismissing those claimants. 2008 WL 4876860; 654 F. Supp. 2d 767; 647 F. Supp. 2d 951. In 2004, before the filing of the summary judgment motions as to individual claimants began, there were approximately 121 claimants. By 2010, IPA obtained rulings dismissing 40 of those claimants based on summary judgment and statutes of limitations. 81 triable complaints proceeded.

On October 9, 2009, the defendants moved for summary judgment on the EEOC’s “pattern or practice” claim. The court considered only the defendant’s statistical arguments (the defendants claimed that the number of individual claimants was too statistically insignificant to present a triable claim for a “pattern or practice”), and did not consider the defendant's other arguments. The court found that the statistics alone did not entitle the defendant to judgment as a matter of law, and denied the motion on March 31, 2010. 2010 WL 1416153.

On April 9, 2010, the defendant requested that the court certify its March 31, 2010 order for interlocutory appeal. The court declined to do so on April 16, 2010. On June 14, 2010, the court found, upon the consent of the defendant, that an unlawful pattern or practice of tolerating sexual harassment existed at the business from November 25, 1997 to February 14, 2005. With the order entered on Phase I, the case proceeded toward trial on Phase II.

On June 16, 2010, the defendant moved to sever the individual claims for compensatory and punitive damages for the eighty-one remaining claimants, or, in the alternative, for separate trials. The court denied the motion on June 29, 2010.

Trial began in the case on July 6, 2010. After the start of jury selection, the parties reached a tentative settlement agreement, and the court stayed the trial. At that point, the parties began to work to finalize a consent decree. On February 9, 2011, the court entered an order granting the parties’ joint motion to enforce the settlement agreement reached in court on July 6, 2010.

The court entered the consent decree on March 2, 2011. The consent decree included injunctive provisions enjoining the defendant and its employees from retaliation and from discrimination against women on the basis of sex by sexually harassing female employees, harassing female employees on account of their sex, and/or creating, facilitating, or permitting the existence of a hostile work environment. The consent decree also required the defendant to implement and maintain compliance with a “statement of intolerance of sexual harassment,” establish a sexual harassment policy and complaint procedure, and provide training regarding sexual harassment. The defendant paid eight million dollars to a settlement fund to be distributed as compensatory damages to the eligible claimants, including the intervenors. The settlement fund also paid attorney’s fees and costs in the amount of $431,667 to attorneys for the plaintiff-intervenors. The consent decree appointed Nancy B. Kreiter and George F. Galland as Decree Monitors to oversee IPA’s implementation of the decree’s terms. The court retained jurisdiction over the consent decree for three years.

After the entry of the consent decree, the parties' outstanding motions were denied as moot on March 24, 2011. The Monitors’ reports of February 23, 2012 and March 4, 2013 both found the defendant in compliance with the consent decree and made certain recommendations, mostly concerning profanity, enforcement of the dress code, and restructuring of Human Resources. 

On May 14, 2013, the plaintiffs moved to amend the consent decree. The motion, to which the defendants agreed, proposed an amendment to the payment schedule in the consent decree. Under the consent decree, the defendants were responsible for annual payments to a settlement account, but had not made its annual payments on time, and claimed financial hardship, so the parties agreed to allow weekly payments to ensure that final payment was fully and timely made in March 2014. Judge Gotschall granted the motion on May 22, 2013.

The defendants submitted their final payment into the settlement fund on March 3, 2014, and the Monitors submitted their final report on March 10, 2014, finding that the IPA complied fully with the decree. The case is now closed.","

The plaintiffs were represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union Immigration Rights Project, the ACLU Foundation of Texas, Oxfam America, the Center for Gender and Refugees Studies, and the ACLU of D.C.. They sued the Acting Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security Chad Wolf, Acting Commissioner of Customs and Border Protection Mark Morgan, Chief of U.S. Border Patrol Rodney Scott, Director of Immigration Customs and Enforcement Matthew Albence, Secretary of HHS Alex Azar, and CDC Director Robert Redfield. The complaint contended that the federal government had implemented a new process of removing immigrant children without providing for adequate protections, especially by holding those children away from their families or other sponsors and by not providing counsel. This process was instituted over a series of regulations, orders, and agency memos that the complaint calls the ""Title 42 Process."" The complaint argued that this Title 42 Process violated the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), the Administrative Procedure Act (APA), the Public Health Service Act (PHSA), the Foreign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act (FARRA), and that agencies exceed the power granted to them under the Immigration and Naturalization Act. They requested declaratory relief and injunctive relief that would prohibit the defendants from enforcing the Title 42 Process, stay their removal, grant them counsel, and grant the children TVPRA protections.

The case was assigned to Judge Beryl A. Howell.

The complaint alleged violations of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, in that a female employee was sexually harassed by a male manager and male coworkers when they made obscene comments, sexual innuendos, and requested to have sex with her.  The charging party then intervened as a plaintiff. After some initial discovery, the EEOC moved for partial summary judgment in May 2004.  The parties settled in less than a month and in June 2004 a consent decree was issued.

The parties agreed that the injunctive terms of the agreement would extend for three years and that there shall be 10 days notice to defendant if there is a belief that it is violating the agreement and a subsequent face-to-face conference to resolve any issues.  The defendant was enjoined from discriminating on the basis of sex, was not to retaliate against any employee who complains of such discrimination, and had to distribute a copy of its nondiscrimination policy to all current employees.  The female employee received $30,001.40 and her attorney received $27,498.60.  All employees, supervisors and managers were to receive no less than four hours of training on the employment provisions of Title VII.  This training was to be repeated every year within 30 days of the anniversary of the decree.  Further, an EEOC prepared notice was to be conspicuously displayed in the defendant's Texas facility for the duration of the agreement.

In the initial complaint, female employee Tina S. Roberson alleged sexual harassment and a hostile work environment at Key Energy's facility in Alice, Texas, with the company failing to take appropriate action. The EEOC filed a lawsuit on behalf of Ms. Roberson, seeking relief for these unlawful practices and a trial by jury. The defendant, represented by attorneys Noe Garza, Robert Carroll, and Glen Pavalik, denied some of the allegations and presented various defenses. The case was eventually settled without further litigation, with a Consent Decree being entered.

IM-FL-0018,"On March 28, 1997, Nicaraguan aliens filed a class-action complaint in the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida, challenging the federal government's interpretation of the applicability of the ""stop-time"" rule for determining eligibility for suspension of deportation.

Prior to the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act (IIRIRA) of 1996, which amended the Immigration and Nationality Act, an alien facing deportation could apply for ""suspension of deportation"" if he met certain statutory factors, which included that the alien had been ""physically present in the U.S. for a continuous period of not less than 10 years after becoming deportable or 7 years after applying for suspension of deportation.""  Time spent in deportation proceedings counted toward the physical-residence requirement.

The IIRIRA repealed the suspension-of-deportation provision of INA § 244 and replaced it a ""cancellation of removal"" provision.  To be eligible for cancellation of removal, the alien was required to meet certain time requirements of residing in the U.S.  The IIRIRA also contained a new ""stop-time"" provision, under which an alien's period of residence or continuous physical presence in the U.S. was deemed to end once the alien was served with a ""notice to appear"" for removal proceedings or committed a criminal offense described in INA § 244A(d)(1).  Shortly after the enactment of IIRIRA, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) held that the new ""stop-time"" rule applied to aliens who had applied for suspension of deportation prior to IIRIRA's enactment.  Plaintiffs challenged the BIA's application of the ""stop-time"" rule as violating the Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses of the Fifth Amendment.

This case, titled ""Roberto TEFEL et al. v. Janet RENO et al.,"" involves a class action lawsuit filed by a group of Nicaraguan immigrants against the United States Department of Justice and the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). The plaintiffs, represented by the law firm Kurzban Kurzban Weinger and Tetzeli, P.A., allege that the defendants violated their rights by denying them the opportunity to seek suspension of deportation under the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA). The plaintiffs, including Roberto Tefel and various other individuals and families from Nicaragua, applied for suspension of deportation in response to the defendants' invitation in 1995 and paid substantial fees to do so. However, the defendants later claimed that all class members were ineligible for this relief, leading to the plaintiffs' lawsuit. The plaintiffs argue that the defendants' interpretation of the INA is contrary to the plain language of the statute and was not properly promulgated. They also claim that the defendants' actions have caused them irreparable harm, requiring them to retain counsel and face deportation proceedings. The plaintiffs are seeking certification of the class, a declaration that the defendants' conduct violates the INA, and various forms of relief, including a writ of habeas corpus.",0.5075,0.2036,0.2906,0.14,0.056,0.08,0.2587,0.1038,0.1481

JC-AZ-0016,"COVID-19 Summary: This class action lawsuit was filed on June 16, 2020 by detainees in the Maricopa County Jail system in Arizona, who sought extra protections from COVID-19 and, in some cases, release. The Court denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction on August 14, 2020.<hr>This is a lawsuit challenging the Maricopa County Sheriff's response to COVID-19 in its jails and requesting the release of detainees and prisoners. On June 16, 2020, nine named plaintiffs and the immigrants' rights non-profit Puente Human Rights Movement filed this class action law suit and habeas petition in the United States District Court for the District of Arizona. The plaintiffs sued Maricopa County and its Sheriff under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (42 U.S.C. § 12131), and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. § 794) and petitioned the court for a writ of habeas corpus under 28 U.S.C. § 2241. Represented by the national and Arizona ACLUs, as well as several law firms working pro bono, the plaintiffs sought to certify several classes of detainees and prisoners, the release of certain individuals at high risk of developing serious illness from COVID-19, and injunctions governing the Sheriff's response to COVID-19 in Maricopa County's jails, as well as attorneys' fees. The plaintiffs claimed that their rights under the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments, as well as the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act, were violated by the Sheriff's response to COVID-19.

The plaintiffs claimed that the defendants placed them in danger of contracting COVID-19 by continuing to book new detainees in the jail without quarantining them from the existing population, as well as a host of other unsafe practices, including a lack of masks and cleaning supplies, little testing for individuals held in the jail or jail staff, and crowded conditions that prevented social distancing. According to the complaint, the pretrial detainees' Fourteenth Amendment rights were violated by the conditions of their confinement, which amounted to deliberate indifference and unconstitutional punishment prior to conviction. The convicted prisoners made a similar Eighth Amendment deliberate indifference claim. Additionally, the subclasses of prisoners with disabilities claimed that their rights under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act to equal access to jail programming were violated by the defendants' COVID-19 response. Finally, the plaintiffs requested that the court release medically vulnerable pretrial detainees.

The case was assigned to United States District Judge Steven P. Logan. On June 29, 2020, the plaintiffs filed an ex parte motion for a temporary restraining order against the defendants, ordering them to improve COVID-19 safety protocols and begin releasing medically vulnerable pretrial detainees. Judge Logan denied the plaintiffs' ex parte request, but set a briefing schedule to determine whether to grant a similar preliminary injunction on July 2, 2020. The defendants then moved to dismiss the case on July 20, 2020. 

Judge Logan resolved both of these motions in an August 14, 2020 opinion. He denied the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction, finding that the plaintiffs did not demonstrate a likelihood of success on the merits of their claims. He also granted the defendants' motion to dismiss some of the plaintiffs' municipal liability claims against the Sheriff, but not the County. 

Shortly after the filing of the lawsuit, back on June 29, 2020, the plaintiffs had moved for class certification. Judge Logan granted that motion in a November 13, 2020 opinion and certified two classes, one of detainees incarcerated pending trial and one of convicted prisoners, and four subclasses (two within each class) of medically vulnerable individuals and individuals with disabilities.

After class certification was granted, the parties began the discovery process. The case is ongoing.

The document titled ""Plaintiffs' Response to Defendants' Motion to Strike Exhibits and to Decertify Subclasses"" is a pivotal part of a larger lawsuit brought forth by three incarcerated individuals, Fenty, Stepter, and Scroggins, against the defendants responsible for managing and operating Maricopa County jails. These plaintiffs, represented by experienced attorneys Sarah A. Dunne and Michele L. Storms of the ACLU of Washington Foundation, are seeking to represent a class and subclasses of medically vulnerable inmates who are at a heightened risk of contracting COVID-19 due to the conditions within the facilities. The defendants have been accused of violating the plaintiffs' constitutional rights by failing to provide adequate protection and care for their health and safety. The plaintiffs allege that the overcrowding, lack of sanitation, and failure to accommodate individuals with disabilities have put them at an increased risk of contracting the virus. Seeking injunctive relief, the plaintiffs are asking for immediate release and modifications to access services and programs that will protect their health and safety. The defendants have filed a motion to strike exhibits and decertify the subclasses, arguing that the class representatives are not adequate or typical and that the proposed class definition is overly broad.

EE-TX-0095,"In June 2002, the Houston District Office of the EEOC brought this suit against Dallas Morning News, L.P. and Belo Corp. in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Texas alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, the defendants allegedly retaliated against the charging party, a female employee, because she filed charges of race discrimination by disciplining her, threatening her, and eventually terminating her.  After some discovery and scheduling orders, the parties settled through a consent decree in September 2003.  

The one-year decree, containing non-discrimination and non-retaliation clauses, required the defendants to: provide the charging party with a neutral employment reference, expunge her file of all references to the discrimination charges, post a nondiscrimination notice, and provide anti-retaliation training to the supervisors of the charging party's former work group.  In addition, the defendants agreed to pay an undisclosed amount of monetary relief to the charging party.

This document is a collection of court filings related to a case involving Belo Corp, Dallas Morning News, L.P., and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The case, titled ""Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v. Dallas Morning News, Inc."", was filed on June 17, 2002, in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas. The EEOC, represented by Rodolfo Lucio Sustaita and James Sacher, alleged that the defendants engaged in unlawful employment practices, including retaliation against employee Wendy W. Jackson for her opposition to discriminatory practices and participation in investigations under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. The defendants, represented by Robert E. Sheeder, Barry S. Hersh, and others, denied the allegations and filed motions for protective orders during the course of the proceedings. On September 19, 2003, Judge Ed Kinkeade approved and entered a consent decree, resolving the case without a finding of liability or admission of liability by the defendants. The consent decree specified that the defendants must comply with Title VII and not retaliate against any employee or applicant for engaging in protected activity or participating in investigations or court proceedings. The defendants also agreed to provide standard job references",0.4472,0.5394,0.489,0.1616,0.1951,0.1768,0.2563,0.3091,0.2802
PN-AZ-0001,"This lawsuit was the result of an investigation launched by the Civil Rights Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in 2009 into the alleged targeting and unconstitutional treatment of Latinos by the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office. (The DOJ's initial inquiry apparently started in 2008, but the formal investigation opened with notice to the Sheriff's Office in March 2009.)

The Sheriff's Office declined to cooperate in the investigation, leading the DOJ to file a a related lawsuit in September 2010 against Maricopa County under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, seeking to compel the Sheriff's Office to provide the requested information. See <a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12019"">PN-AZ-0002 in this Clearinghouse</a>). Maricopa County settled that lawsuit in June 2011, and agreed to cooperate.

(Also, prior to this case, in 2007, a group of plaintiffs had filed a lawsuit, Melendres v. Arpaio, against the County of Maricopa, the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office, and Sheriff Joe Arpaio. (<a href=""https://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12282"">PN-AZ-0003 in this Clearinghouse</a>). In 2013, the Melendres Court found the MCSO in violation of the Constitution, and entered a permanent injunction forbidding racial profiling.) 

In this matter, DOJ released its findings letter reporting the results of the investigation on December 15, 2011. The letter reported that the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) was engaged in an unconstitutional pattern of policing. The DOJ found that the MSCO profiled Latinos, and unlawfully stoped, detained, and arrested Latinos. The DOJ also found that services in the Maricopa County Jail for people of limited English proficiency were insufficient or nonexistent. The DOJ found that a lack of policy to ensure constitutional policing underscored these problems. 

On May 10, 2012, the DOJ filed this lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 14141 and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 against Maricopa County and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO) in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona. Specifically, the DOJ's complaint alleged that: <ul><li>(1) the MSCO's policies and practices discriminated against Latino persons;<li>(2) the MSCO targeted Latino workers while enforcing state identity theft laws, resulting in the seizure of Latinos at worksites without reasonable suspicion;<li>(3) the MSCO's discriminatory law enforcements practices violated Title VI;<li>(4) the County's jails discriminated against limited English proficiency Latino prisoners in violation of Title VI; <li>(5) the County and MSCO were violating their Title VI contractual assurances; and <li>(6) the County and MSCO retaliated against persons in Maricopa County on the basis of their protected speech.</li></ul>
The DOJ requested injunctive and declaratory relief to stop Maricopa County's alleged practice of depriving Latino persons of their constitutional rights and to stop discrimination against Latinos in violation of Title VI.

The case was assigned to Chief Judge Roslyn O. Silver. On December 12, 2012, she denied Defendants' motion to dismiss the case, but granted the motion to dismiss the MCSO from the case, ruling the MCSO was not an entity that could sue or be sued.

On September 4, 2014, after lengthy discovery, proceedings were held before Judge Silver in which both parties informed the court that they would file dispositive motions. On October 27, the DOJ filed its motion for summary judgment, arguing that the Defendants were precluded by collateral estoppel from re-litigating the issue of whether the MSCO's traffic stops constituted a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. The DOJ claimed that the issue had already been decided against the MSCO in <i>Melendres v. Arpaio</i>, where the MCSO was a defendant. 989 F. Supp. 2d 822 (D. Ariz. 2013) (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12282"">PN-AZ-0003 in this Clearinghouse</a>). On the same day, the Defendants made a cross-motion for summary judgment, arguing that neither Title VI nor § 14141 authorized this suit against Maricopa County. On June 15, 2015, Judge Silver granted the DOJ's motion with respect to the traffic stops and denied the Defendants' motion.

On July 15, 2015, Judge Silver ordered the parties to file a joint statement setting forth what issues remained for trial. In response, on July 17, the parties filed a joint motion to approve a settlement agreement regarding the second, fourth, and sixth claims for relief from the DOJ's complaint. The MSCO agreed to stop unconstitutionally enforcing state identity theft laws and to develop an anti-retaliation policy. On July 20, the DOJ moved to stay this action until the court in <i>Melendres</i> (<a href=""http://www.clearinghouse.net/detail.php?id=12282"">PN-AZ-0003 in this Clearinghouse</a>), in which the DOJ had recently intervened, found that the Defendants had maintained compliance with an injunction for three years. However, the Defendants argued this was inappropriate because when the DOJ moved to intervene in <i>Melendres</i>, it had represented that it would terminate the overlapping parts of this case if the intervention motion was granted. On September 2, 2015, Judge Silver granted the parties' joint motion to approve the settlement agreement with respect to the issues not covered by <i>Melendres</i>--worksite operations and retaliation--but otherwise dismissed the matter.  

On December 30, 2015, Maricopa County appealed this case to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 

Over the next two years, little happened in the case as the parties awaited a decision from the appellate court. 

On May 7, 2018, the Court issued an opinion affirming the judgment. Judge Paul J. Watford held that sheriffs act as final policymakers for their respective counties on law-enforcement matters. Moreover, U.S.C. §12601 imposed liability on a governmental authority whose own official policy caused it to engage in “a pattern or practice of conduct by law enforcement officers” that deprived persons of federally protected rights. Because sheriffs are final policymakers for their counties, the policies they adopt are, in fact, the counties' policies. For this reason, Maricopa County should be held liable for their sheriffs' acts. 

On June 21, 2018, Maricopa County filed a petition for panel rehearing and a petition for rehearing <i>en banc</i>, but the request was denied. On October 15, 2018, Maricopa County filed a petition for a <i>writ of certiorari</i> in the United States Supreme Court. Certiorari was denied on March 25, 2019. 139 S.Ct. 1373. 

The parties jointly moved to terminate the settlement on May 9, 2019. The court ordered this termination on May 14, and the case has since been closed. "," 

This document is a comprehensive summary of the civil case (2:12-cv-981) filed in the U.S. District Court for the District of Arizona, involving the United States of America against Maricopa County, its sheriff Joseph M. Arpaio, and the Maricopa County Sheriff's Office (MCSO). The plaintiffs, represented by attorneys from the US Department of Justice and law firm Jones Skelton & Hochuli PLC, alleged that the MCSO engaged in discriminatory practices against Latinos, including racial profiling, unlawful stops, detentions, and arrests. The specific allegations included excessive force, biased policing, and retaliation against those who spoke out against MCSO's policies. The defendants, represented by attorneys from Walker & Peskind PLLC, Winston & Strawn LLP, and attorney Joseph Popolizio, denied these allegations. The plaintiffs sought systemic reforms within MCSO, such as improved data collection, risk management, and training for deputies in constitutional policing. The court proceedings involved multiple filings and submissions, with both sides presenting evidence and arguments. The final verdict found MCSO guilty of civil rights violations and ordered them to implement changes in their policies and practices to comply with federal laws and protect the rights of all individuals, regardless of their race or ethnicity",0.6548,0.1148,0.1953,0.2296,0.0401,0.0682,0.3553,0.0623,0.106
CJ-OK-0004,"On July 20, 2005, two death-sentenced inmates of the Oklahoma State Penitentiary in McAlester, Oklahoma, filed a lawsuit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 against the Oklahoma Department of Corrections in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma.  Anderson and Taylor complained to the Court that the lethal injection procedure used by the defendants during executions violated the Constitution by inflicting enormous amounts of pain on the executed prisoner.  Specifically, they claimed that the defendants 1) violated medically approved procedures by failing to employ properly trained people to inject the anesthesia, 2) arbitrarily and unnecessarily used drugs and drug dosages that created significant risks that the condemned prisoner would suffer unnecessary pain, 3) used a sequence of drug administration that delays administration of the anesthetic until after the prisoner is dead, 4) delivered the drugs through alternating IV lines, impairing control over the timing and sequence of drug delivery and increasing the risk of drug administration failure.  Due to these concerns, the plaintiffs asked the Court to stay their executions and to enjoin the defendants from using the lethal injection procedure that they normally used.  

On August 15, 2005, the case was referred to Magistrage Judge Bacharach.  On September 6, 2005, the defendants asked the Court to dismiss the plaintiff's complaint, arguing that the Anderson and Taylor had failed to show any likelihood that their claim would succeed at trial.  On December 20, 2005, Judge Bacharach filed a report stating that the plaintiffs had demonstrated that they had a viable claim and recommending that the District Court should overrule the defendants' motion to dismiss.  On January 11, 2006, the District Court (Judge Stephen P. Friot) adopted the Magistrate's recommendation and overruled the motion to dismiss.  Anderson v. Evans, 2006 WL 83093 (W.D.Okla. Jan. 11, 2006).

On December 19, 2006, the parties initiated a settlement conference and sought asistance from the court.  On February 22, 2007, the parties held their settlement conference with Magistrate Judge Doyle Argo. On March 6, 2007, the parties entered a joint motion asking the District Court to stay the case and place it in abeyance for a period of one year.  We're not sure exactly why the defendants agreed to put off the case for a year, but their motion mentions ""recent developments in Plaintiff Anderson's habeas case"" and states that neither of the plaintiffs would ""face execution during the abeyance period, or for some time thereafter.""  The District Court agreed to place the lawsuit on hold for a year.  

On June 19, 2007, Plaintiff Anderson asked the Court to allow him to withdraw from the case.  Apparently, he had been re-sentenced to life in prison without parole, so he was no longer facing execution.  On July 10, 2007, the District Court (Judge Friot) allowed Anderson to withdraw from the case, and the case was renamed ""Taylor v. Jones.""  

On June 8, 2009 the United States District Court for the Western District of Oklahoma dismissed the case without prejudice because the remaining named defendant lacked standing.  The District Court held that ""the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the District Court's denial of the plaintiff's writ of habeas corpus and remanded with instructions to grant the writ as to his conviction and execution subject to the State's right to re-try the case within a reasonable time."" Accordingly, the District Court found that the issue was moot as to Plaintiff Taylor, which called for a dismissal of the case. 

The Docket shows that the case was terminated as of June 8, 2009.

This case file, titled ""Glenn Anderson and Charles F Taylor v. Ernest Godlove, David C Henneke, Ted Logan, Beverly Young, Earnest D Ware, Robert L Rainey, W Mark Luttrell, Edward L Evans, and Mike Mullin,"" documents a legal battle between plaintiffs Glenn Anderson and Charles F Taylor and multiple defendants, all individuals involved in the Oklahoma Department of Corrections and the Oklahoma State Penitentiary. The plaintiffs, represented by various attorneys including James A Drummond, Patti P Ghezzi, and Susan M Otto, alleged that the defendants were responsible for violating their constitutional rights due to the flawed execution protocol used in Oklahoma. Specifically, the plaintiffs claimed that the protocol put them at risk for conscious suffering and pain during execution, and also showed deliberate indifference towards their health and safety. They sought relief in the form of a declaration that the protocol was unconstitutional and an injunction to prevent any further executions until a new protocol was established. 

The case was referred to Magistrate Judge Robert Bacharach, who oversaw the various motions and proceedings. Over the course of several years, the plaintiffs filed multiple motions and joint motions, including a motion to withdraw as attorney and a motion to continue deadlines.

FA-IN-0001,"On December 3, 2013, the University of Notre Dame, a religious nonprofit university, filed this lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana against the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). Notre Dame alleged that the Affordable Care Act's (ACA) contraception insurance mandate, even with the accommodation for nonprofit religious organizations, violated the Establishment Clause and Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment and the Religious Freedom Restoration Act (RFRA). Notre Dame sought preliminary and permanent injunctions barring the government from enforcing the contraception insurance mandate to avoid a violation of Notre Dame's deeply held religious beliefs.

On December 20, 2013, the District Court (Judge Philip P. Simon) denied Notre Dame's motion for preliminary injunction. The Court found that the ACA's insurance accommodation, which allowed the head of an eligible organization to provide self-certification which in turn triggered a third-party administrator to provide contraception coverage to the organization's employees, did not impose a substantial burden on the free exercise of the religion. University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 988 F.Supp.2d 912 (N.D. IN. 2013) The same day, Notre Dame filed an interlocutory appeal with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit (No. 13-3853) and a motion for preliminary injunction with the District Court pending their appeal. 

On December 23, 2013, the District Court denied the plaintiff's motion for injunction pending appeal and on December 30, 2013, the Seventh Circuit denied the plaintiff's emergency motion for injunction pending appeal. 

On February 21, 2014, the Seventh Circuit (Judge Richard Posner) affirmed the District Court's denial of preliminary injunction. The Court of Appeals found that the ACA's insurance accommodation was consistent with the balancing act required by RFRA and therefore it did not substantially burden the free exercise of plaintiffs. University of Notre Dame v. Sebelius, 743 F.3d 547 (N.D. IN. 2014). On May 7, 2014, the Seventh Circuit denied plaintiffs' April 4, 2014, motion for rehearing. 

Notre Dame sought review in the Supreme Court, and on March 9, 2015, the Court granted the writ of certiorari, vacated the judgment, and remanded the case to the Seventh Circuit for further consideration in light of its decision (after the Seventh Circuit's decision) in <i>Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.</i>, 134 S. Ct. 2751 (2014). University of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 135 U.S. 1258 (2015) (cert. granted). In <i>Hobby Lobby</i>, the Supreme Court had held that the HHS regulations imposing the contraceptive mandate violated RFRA, when applied to closely held for-profit corporations. The Court emphasized, however, that alternative methods for meeting the government's asserted interest were available. 

On remand, after hearing oral arguments on April 22, 2015, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the District Court's denial of preliminary injunction on May 19, 2015, holding that Notre Dame had still not met its burden of establishing an entitlement to a preliminary injunction. University of Notre Dame v. Burwell, 786 F.3d 606 (7th Cir. 2015).

Notre Dame sought a rehearing en banc on July 2, 2015. The Seventh Circuit denied the request on July 24, 2015. On June 17, 2016, the Supreme Court remanded the case back to the Seventh Circuit in light of the per curiam decision in <i>Zubik v. Burwell</i>, 136 S.Ct. 1557 (2016) (Clearinghouse summary available <a href=” https://www.clearinghouse.net/featuredCase.php?id=36”>here</a>). In <i>Zubik</i>, the Supreme Court vacated a series of Court of Appeals decisions that concerned religious exemptions to the contraception mandate in the ACA and remanded those cases back to the lower courts to “afford an opportunity” for the parties and the Court of Appeals to further consider the burden imposed in requiring non-profit religious organizations (“challengers”) to fill out a form notifying the government that they objected to providing contraceptive coverage, and to arrive at an approach that would, going forward, accommodate challengers’ religious exercise while at the same time ensuring that women covered by the challengers’  health plans receive full and equal health coverage, including contraceptive coverage.

As it appeared that proceedings in the Seventh Circuit would continue for some time, the case was statistically closed in the district court on March 2, 2017, until the appellate proceedings concluded. The case remains ongoing in the Seventh Circuit.","

The document titled ""Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief"" is a legal complaint filed by University of Notre Dame against government officials Kathleen Sebelius, Timothy Geithner, and Hilda Solis, along with various US departments. The university, a Catholic institution, opposed a regulatory requirement that conflicted with their religious beliefs. They argued that the requirement, which would require them to provide insurance coverage for contraception and abortion-inducing drugs, violated their rights under the First Amendment, the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, and the Administrative Procedure Act. The defendants responded with a motion to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction and a response to the plaintiff's motion for a permanent and preliminary injunction. The court ultimately granted the motion to dismiss and denied the plaintiff's motion for an injunction. This decision was reached after multiple filings from both parties, including motions for leave to appear as amici curiae and for oral argument. The plaintiffs, Notre Dame, sought relief from the mandate, stating that it posed an immediate and ongoing harm to their organization. They also accused the U.S. Government of violating the Weldon Amendment, which prohibits discrimination against health care entities for not providing, paying for, or referring for abortions. The defendants, the U.S. Government, were accused",0.6731,0.1902,0.2966,0.1884,0.0531,0.0828,0.3413,0.0965,0.1504
EE-NY-0146,"In January 2004, the New York District Office of the EEOC brought this lawsuit against SPS Temporaries, Inc. and Professional Personnel Management Corporation, temporary employment service providers, and two of their clients, Jamestown Container Companies and Whiting Door Manufacturing Corp., in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of New York, alleging discrimination and retaliation in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act, and the Americans with Disabilities Act.  Specifically, the EEOC alleged that the defendants were assigning temporary employees based upon discriminatory requests for client companies, failed to employ persons based upon questionnaire information indicating the potential employee was disabled, and refusing to assign work to a temporary employee who was pregnant.  Following some discovery and several settlement conferences, the parties settled the lawsuit through a series of consent decrees tailored to each defendant in November 2005.  

The consent decrees ranged from three to four years of enforcement and contained anti-discrimination and retaliation clauses. It required the defendants to: make reports based upon complaints and make other compliance reports, keep records, allow access to the EEOC for monitoring, appoint a monitor, develop anti-discrimination policies, utilize objective job descriptions and hiring criteria, follow hiring protocols, comply with advertising requirements, post and distribute notice of rights to employees, temporary employees, and clients hiring temporary employees, provide annual EEO training, include Decree compliance with other criteria for managerial performance reviews, and contribute $580,000 to a Claims fund, to be distributed among an initial three complainants plus all other class members to be determined.

As there is no additional activity in the docket sheet, other than the approval of plaintiff's Class Distribution List, presumably the case closed completely in 2009.

The document at hand is a compilation of individual summaries from a legal case filed by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) against SPS Temporaries, Inc., Professional Personnel Management Corp., Whiting Door Manufacturing Corporation, and Jamestown Container Corporation. The case, filed in October 2003 in the Western District of New York, alleged that the defendants engaged in discriminatory employment practices based on race, gender, pregnancy, national origin, age, and disability. The plaintiffs in this class action lawsuit included African American and Hispanic employees who were denied work assignments and faced discriminatory treatment. The EEOC also accused SPS of destroying evidence during their investigation and requiring applicants to disclose disability information on a pre-employment questionnaire. Additionally, the suit claimed that employees were discharged due to their disabilities, pregnancy, and questioning of discriminatory hiring practices. The EEOC sought monetary relief for the affected individuals and the implementation of new policies and procedures to prevent future discrimination. The EEOC was represented by attorneys from Hodgson Russ, while the defendants were represented by attorneys from different firms.

EE-NC-0086,"The EEOC's Charlotte office filed this suit in U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina on September 28, 2006. The suit alleged that defendant Mid-State Petroleum, Inc., doing business as The Pop Shoppe, failed to reasonably accommodate a Muslim woman by refusing to hire her after she requested the ability to wear a hijab at work for religious reasons.

This document, titled ""Decree Between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and Mid-State Petroleum, Inc. d/b/a The Pop Shoppe,"" outlines a settlement between the EEOC and the defendant, Mid-State Petroleum, in a case involving allegations of religious discrimination. The plaintiff, the EEOC, filed a complaint against the defendant in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of North Carolina, represented by lead attorney Mary Margaret Ryerse, on September 28th, 2006. The defendant's answer and corporate disclosure statement were filed on November 22nd, 2006, and a discovery plan was submitted by both parties on December 22nd, 2006. A pretrial order was issued on December 28th, 2006, setting deadlines for discovery, mediation, and motions.

The plaintiff sought a permanent injunction to prevent future discrimination, back pay, compensation for financial and emotional losses, punitive damages, and implementation of policies and practices that provide equal employment opportunities regardless of religion.

CJ-CO-0004,"On November 7, 2017, a former pretrial detainee who was incarcerated for several weeks in the El Paso County Colorado Jail filed suit against that county in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado under 42 U.S.C. § 1983. The plaintiff, represented by the ACLU Foundation of Colorado, sought compensatory damages and attorney’s fees, claiming violations of the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection and Due Process Clauses. 

The plaintiff claimed that El Paso County had an official policy and actual practice of denying pretrial liberty to defendants granted a personal recognizance (PR) bond by a state court judge, solely for their inability to pay a $55 pretrial service fee to the county. While incarcerated, the plaintiff was separated from her newborn child when child custody proceedings were initiated against her that she was unable to competently contest while she was in jail. The plaintiff also claimed that state court judges in the county believed that they could not waive this fee without express permission from a bond commissioner of El Paso County Pretrial Services; they argued that employees of that agency were disincentivized from doing so because the $55 fee is chargeable before release funded the county’s pretrial supervision program. 

A little over a week after the complaint was filed, the Denver Channel reported that Chief Judge William Bain of the Fourth Judicial Circuit of Colorado, which includes all state courts in El Paso County, had ordered that detainees granted a personal recognizance bond but unable to pay the $55 pretrial services fee must be released from jail that same day.

On December 28, 2017, the plaintiff filed an amended complaint with an expanded fact section, emphasizing that El Paso County, through its sheriff, was the sole party blocking the release of detainees unable to pay the $55 fee to the county under the former policy. 

The defendant moved to dismiss the complaint on January 11, 2018. The county alleged that the plaintiff had failed to state a claim for which relief could be granted. Specifically, the county argued that the plaintiff could not demonstrate that there was such a county policy or that the county was the “moving force” of the policy as described. Before Judge Wiley Young Daniel could make a decision on this motion, the parties informed him that they were working on a private settlement. Over the next several months the judge extended several deadlines for the parties to allow them to continue exploring a private settlement. 

According to the ACLU’s <a href=""https://www.aclu.org/news/el-paso-county-agrees-pay-190k-nearly-200-individuals-who-were-jailed-because-they-could-not"">website</a>, the parties agreed to settle out of court for $190,000 on August 13, 2018. According to the <a href=""https://gazette.com/news/el-paso-county-agrees-to-pay-up-to-to-settle/article_6de96e20-a00d-11e8-908c-1fe35bfd4cf4.html"">Gazette</a>, the agreement was finalized once it was approved by the El Paso County Board of County Commissioners on August 14, 2018. The settlement provided $60,000 to compensate the plaintiff for her incarceration and for attorney costs. The remaining $130,000 was allocated for 183 other individuals who the parties identified who had been held in the El Paso County Jail solely for inability to pay the $55 fee. Each of them are eligible for compensation based on $125 per day of incarceration. The parties eligible for this compensation must contact the county within two years to recover these funds.  

On August 17, 2018, Judge Daniel dismissed the lawsuit with consent of the parties. The case is now closed. ","

This case, filed under the Civil Rights Act, involves a complaint filed by plaintiff Jasmine Still against defendant El Paso County, Colorado in the U.S. District Court for the District of Colorado. Ms. Still, represented by attorneys from the American Civil Liberties Union, alleges that she was held in jail for 27 days solely because she could not pay the pretrial services fee, despite being granted a personal recognizance bond and not being a flight risk or threat to others. This policy has affected hundreds of individuals and Ms. Still seeks to vindicate her constitutional rights through this lawsuit. The defendant, represented by attorneys from the El Paso County Attorney's Office, has a policy of requiring a $55 pretrial services fee for release, resulting in many individuals being unfairly incarcerated for weeks or months. Ms. Still's case highlights the issue of poverty-based detention and the county's failure to provide adequate procedural safeguards for determining the fee. The complaint argues that the defendant's policy violates the Fourteenth Amendment by jailing someone solely because of their inability to make a monetary payment and is not rationally related to the legitimate governmental interests of preventing flight or ensuring public safety.

The intervenor's complaint alleged that GM unlawfully discriminated against a female employee in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  Specifically, she alleged that, while at the Shreveport facility, coworkers sexually harassed her to the point she had to quit her position.  After a defense motion for dismissal and partial summary judgment was pending for approximately three months, the parties jointly moved for a consent decree to be entered in December 1999.  

The consent decree dictated the fallowing: defendant must (1) pay the aggrieved employee $100,000 in settlement of all claims relating to this litigation, (2) provide the EEOC with semi-annual complaint reports, and (3) provide EEO training to all of its supervisors and managers.

This document is a Consent Decree between the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and General Motors Corporation (GM), settling a lawsuit regarding alleged Title VII violations. The lawsuit, filed in 1998, was brought by the EEOC on behalf of Linda F. Logan, a black female who had worked for GM from 1981 to 1996. The complaint alleged that Logan was subjected to discrimination and sexual harassment during her employment, leading to her eventual termination. The EEOC also claimed that GM had a history of unlawful employment practices in violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Title I of the Civil Rights Act of 1991.

The parties entered into this Consent Decree to avoid further litigation and to provide final resolution of the issues raised in the complaint. It was agreed that this Decree would not be construed as an admission of guilt by GM, but would be binding on the parties and their successors. The EEOC, as an independent federal law enforcement agency, had the authority to bring suit on behalf of individuals aggrieved by alleged unlawful employment practices. This Consent Decree resolved all claims asserted by the EEOC in the lawsuit.

The Decree included provisions for reporting and training to prevent harassment and",0.4067,0.538,0.4632,0.1394,0.1847,0.1589,0.2297,0.3038,0.2616
IM-KY-0001,"On July 18, 2007, attorneys for the ACLU of Kentucky Foundation, Inc. and private counsel filed suit in the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Kentucky under 42 U.S.C. § 1983 on behalf of a lawful permanent resident living in Kentucky, challenging a Kentucky statute, §1 KRS 237.110, which barred resident aliens from obtaining licenses to carry a concealed deadly weapon. Plaintiff alleged that the U.S. citizenship requirement of the concealed carry law violated equal protection.  Plaintiff sought declaratory and injunctive relief, as well as monetary damages.

Shortly after filing suit, plaintiff moved for a preliminary injunction, which the court granted on March 13, 2008.  The following month, the defendant filed a Motion to Dismiss, arguing that the action was moot because the law had been amended to remove the citizenship requirement.  On June 16, 2008, the court entered an order converting the preliminary injunction into a permanent injunction.  The parties then disagreed about the awarding of attorney fees and costs.  In March 2009, the court granted attorneys fees and costs to the plaintiffs, but did reduce the amount requested.  This case was closed in May 2009.
